The TS Central Repository provides a centralized content storage and management system.

- This repository is focused on courses and modules 

- It contains the following directories: 
      * The 'Repo' is the logical organization of the program-wise content
      * The 'Store' is the physical organization of the content files from all programs
      * The 'CoreDocs' is meant for meta-documents -- that is documents about the repository itself -- and general documents
      * The 'Project Status' shows the Central Repository creation and maintenance updates and upcoming content requirements
