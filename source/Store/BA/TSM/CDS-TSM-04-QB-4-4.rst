1. A linear trend is defined to be Yt = 12.5 + 0.5t. What is the trend projection for time (t) = 5?

A. 20.0
B. 24.5
C. 15.0
D. 37.5

**Answer: C**

**Solution:**

We substitute t=5, which gives
Trend = 12.5 + (0.5 x (5))
= 12.5 + 2.5
= 15



2. The trend of a given series exhibits a quadratic function of time. Which of the following would make the resultant series stationary?

A. Single differencing
B. Double differencing
C. Log transformation with no differencing
D. Log transformation with single differencing

**Answer: B**

**Solution:**

When the trend is a quadratic function of time, double differencing makes the resultant series stationary.



3. Select the TRUE statement(s):

    1. An additive model is appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations does not vary with the level of time series
    2. A multiplicative model is appropriate if the seasonal fluctuations increase or decrease proportionally with increases and decreases in the level of the series
    3. A multiplicative model is appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations does not vary with the level of time series
    4. An additive model is appropriate if the seasonal fluctuations increase or decrease proportionally with increases and decreases in the level of the series
    5. Multiplicative decomposition is more prevalent with economic series because most seasonal economic series do have seasonal variations which increase with the level of the series

Options:

A. Only 1 and 2
B. Only 3 and 4
C. 1, 2 and 5
D. 3, 4 and 5

**Answer: C**

**Solution:**

As shown in the following plots, the additive model applies to seasonality that does not vary in magnitude with the level of the time series whereas the multiplicative model applies to seasonality that varies in magnitude with the level of the time series (here - increases with an increase in the level of the time series).

4. You have $100 and invest 65% and 35% to buy Walmart and Meijer stocks respectively. Expected return for Walmart and Meijer is 10% and 5% respectively. What would be the expected portfolio return for this investment?

Options: 

A. 7.65%
B. 7.25%
C. 8.8%
D. 8.25%

**Answer: D**

**Solution:**

If particular return for Walmart is rWalmart and for Meijer is rMeijer, the return of the portfolio (Rp) will be:

0.65 * $r_Walmart$ + 0.35 * $r_Meijer$

So expected return of portfolio  
= 0.65 * 10 + 0.35 * 5
= 6.5 + 1.75 
= 8.25%




5. Based on the Sharpe Ratio for portfolio A and B, which of them would be considered as a better investment?

Options:

    :align: center

A. Portfolio A
B. Portfolio B

**Answer: B**

**Solution:**

According to the Sharpe Ratio, we should consider Portfolio B because even though the rate of return is less than portfolio A, the volatility of portfolio B is less than portfolio A and thus, is less risky.
