This captures the “autoregressive” nature of ARIMA.\n","\n","* d represents the number of times that the data have to be “differenced” to produce a stationary signal (i.e., a signal that has a constant mean over time). This captures the “integrated” nature of ARIMA. If d=0, this means that our data does not tend to go up/down in the long term (i.e., the model is already “stationary”). In this case, then technically you are performing just ARMA, not AR-I-MA. If p is 1, then it means that the data is going up/down linearly. If p is 2, then it means that the data is going up/down exponentially.

The concept of autocorrelation is most often discussed in the context of [time series](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/time-series-analysis) data in which observations occur at different points in time (e.g.,temperature measured on different days of the month, hours of the day).  For example, one might expect the air temperature on the $1^{st}$ day of the month to be more similar to the temperature on the $2^{nd}$ day compared to the $31^{st}$ day.  If the temperature values that occurred closer together in time are, in fact, more similar than the temperature values that occurred farther apart in time, the data would be autocorrelated.\n","\n","Autocorrelation can cause problems in conventional analyses (such as ordinary least squares regression) that assume independence of observations.\n","\n","In a regression analysis, autocorrelation of the regression residuals can also occur if the model is incorrectly specified.  For example, if you are attempting to model a simple linear relationship but the observed relationship is non-linear (i.e., it follows a curved or U-shaped function), then the residuals will be autocorrelated.\n","\n","* Plot ACF and PACF graphs \n","* Analyse and identify the ARIMA (p, d, q) terms"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HMbCF96NvLt_"},"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dV8SoiJaees5"},"source":["### Implement ARIMA model (2 Points)\n","\n","* Fit the timeseries data with ARIMA\n","* Find and interpret the loss (AIC)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CBYKrNu2YLLq"},"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE for ARIMA Model"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6z4_RyrvcBP1"},"source":["#### Plot the predictions"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"27WeG7T-tb3b"},"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RDT_gqZiA9Lj"},"source":["### Implement SARIMAX model (optional)\n","\n","A SARIMA model can be tuned with two kinds of orders: (p,d,q) order, which refers to the order of the time series.
