This approach is generally based on hard data rather than forecasts or opinions. So it just takes a data stream that comes into the algorithm. It processes it quickly and then it makes a decision whether or not to buy or sell. \n","\n","Some major categories of algorithmic trading are:\n","\n","* **mean reversion** exploits the tendency that many of these asset prices revert to some mean after a period of time and it really tries to capitalize on these extreme changes and price of a security assuming that it'll eventually bounce back to its mean.\n","\n","* **momentum strategy** is based on the assumption that the price of an instrument has some inertia. So if it's going in one direction it's going to keep going in that direction.\n","\n","* **statistical arbitrage** is a strategy that identifies pricing discrepancies between securities through modeling techniques. The strategy is market neutral as it involves a long position and a short position of different securities.\n","\n","* **trend following strategies:** the goal of this strategy is to buy an asset when the price goes up and sell it when the price trend goes down.
