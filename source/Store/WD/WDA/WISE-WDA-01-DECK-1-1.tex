\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{}

\noindent \\ \\ {\large \textbf{Welcome to Angular}}

\noindent \\ Angular, is most widely used JavaScript framework for building interactive web apps. It is designed for Web, Desktop and Mobile platforms development, especially Angular is most popular development framework to build interactive Single-Page Applications (SPAs).

\noindent \\ While, we create apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Angular compels us to know about one more scripting language, Typescript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript.

\noindent 

\noindent \\ {\large \textbf{Gap between JavaScript and server-side development}}

\noindent \\ JavaScript is object-based language and is so popular towards client-side development or client-side validation. By nature, JavaScript is not so strict in type checking and is not object-oriented. So, it is missing many features of object-oriented technologies (as most popular server-side technologies are object-oriented but not object-based) and benefits, as a result, JavaScript could not scale for server-side development and confined it-self to client-side validation. After Node.js runtime development, JavaScript emerged as server-side technology, but unfortunately, as JavaScript code grows, it tends to get messier, making it difficult to maintain and reuse the code, is not robust as it is less-strict in type checking which led to compile-time errors, as it lacks object-oriented features and failed at enterprise level as full-fledged server-side technology. Finally, to fill the gap between JavaScript and server-side development, Typescript was presented, to bridge the gap.

\noindent  

\noindent \\ \textbf{Typescript}: [bridge between JavaScript \& Server-side development]

\noindent \\ Typescript is to build on top of JavaScript with its added new features like strongly typed, object- oriented and compiled as a language. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft Corporation.

\noindent \\ Typescript is a language and also has set of tools; reason is, browser will not understand Typescript code, but JavaScript. So every time when you run Typescript, internally it is compiled into equivalent JavaScript code by the Typescript compiler tool.

\noindent \\ As Typescript is object-oriented and it also has set of JavaScript supporting libraries and tools, it scaled towards server-side development quickly as coding in Typescript is easier, strict in type checking, thereby, avoids compile-time errors. One should not forget that it is a wrapper around JavaScript and every Typescript program is internally converted into JavaScript code and thereby executed on browser. However, Typescript could fill gap between JavaScript and Server-side development with its added features and tools. Reason to discuss about Typescript is Angular4 was fully coded and developed in Typescript only.

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent \\ {\large \textbf{Introduction to Angular4}}

\noindent \\ Angular (commonly referred to as `Angular2+' or `Angular v2and above') is one of the most popular Typescript based opensource front-end web development platform, primarily used to build Single- Page Applications (SPAs) and web apps. Angular platform has been maintained by Google, some tech-savvy community of individuals and corporations. Using Angular4 framework one can build web applications and apps using HTML, CSS and Typescript (which is a superset of JavaScript).

\noindent \\ Angular comes with many built-in features in hand:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cross platform}- capability to run apps on web, desktop and mobile.
	\item \textbf{High speed and performance}- lightweight components improves performance
	\item \textbf{Productivity} -- set of tools to generate templates, compilation and deployment
	\item \textbf{Animation} - built in support from library modules to develop animation apps.
	\item \textbf{Http service} -- built in support from library modules to develop http service-based apps.
\end{itemize}
 
\noindent \\ {\large \textbf{Angular Version Story}}

\noindent Angular was first created at Google. AngularJS or Angular-1 was developed by Misko Hevery in 2009.

\noindent There are 3 major releases of Angular. \\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.1in}|p{1.1in}|p{1.1in}|p{1.1in}|} \hline 
\textbf{Release} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Coded in} & \textbf{Architecture} \\ \hline 
\textbf{October 20,\newline 2010} & Angular-1 (or)\newline AngularJS & JavaScript & MVC based \\ \hline 
\textbf{September 14,\newline 2016} & Angular-2 & Typescript & Service/Controller\newline based \\ \hline 
\textbf{November 1,\newline 2017} & Angular-4 & Typescript & Service/Controller\newline based \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}



\noindent \\ \\ There is no backward compatibility from Angular-2 to AngularJS, which means, AngularJS projects will not run on Angular-2, so entire project must be re-coded. But there is backward compatibility from Angular-4 to Angular-2, which means; already developed Angular-2 projects will run on Angular-4 without any issues.

\begin{itemize}
	\item app.module.ts $\mathrm{-}$ If you open the file, you will see that the code has reference to different libraries, which are imported. Angular-cli has used these default libraries for the import -- angular/core, platform-browser. The names itself explain the usage of the libraries.
	\item app.component.css $\mathrm{-}$ You can write your css structure over here. Right now, we have added the background color to the div as shown below.
	\item app.component.html $\mathrm{-}$ The html code will be available in this file. 
	\item app.component.spec.ts $\mathrm{-}$ These are automatically generated files which contain unit tests for source component.
	\item app.component.ts $\mathrm{-}$ The class for the component is defined over here. You can do the processing of the html structure in the .ts file. The processing will include activities such as connecting to the database, interacting with other components, routing, services, etc.
