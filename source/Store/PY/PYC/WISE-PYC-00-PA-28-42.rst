PAC-MAN
=======

Description
------------

The Pac-Man was originally known as *Puckman* in Japan, is the initial game in the Pac-Man series. It was created by Toru Iwatani and released byNamco in 1980. The yellow, pie-shaped Pac-Man character, who travels around a maze trying to eat dots and avoid four mean ghosts, quickly became an icon of the 1980s. 
 
Rules: 
------

* The player, control the yellow, circular Pac-Man using either keyboard arrows. The goal is to move Pac-Man around the maze like screen gobbling up all dots before the four ghosts get you.

* The four ghosts are all different colors. The ghosts begin the game in the "ghost cage" in the center of the maze and roam around the board as the game progresses. 

* If the Pac-Man collides with a ghost, he loses a life, and the game restarts. 

* If Pac-Man eats one of the four power pellets available on each level, the ghosts turn dark blue and Pac-Man is able to eat the ghosts. 

* Once a ghost is gobbled up, it disappears-except for its eyes, which run back to the ghost cage. 

* Occasionally, fruit and to her objects appear on the screen. If Pac-Man gobbles those up then he earns a point bonus, with different fruit worth different values. 

* The game ends when Pac-Man has lost all of this lives. (usually three)
