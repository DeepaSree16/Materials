Hare Hound Chase
=================

Description 
------------

Hare Hound Chase (also known as Paper Chase) is a racing game played outdoors (best played within a wood or even a shrubbery maze) with any\
number of players. It is sometimes said that this game originated in 19th century France, but it is certainly much older than that, with variations being played in medieval times. The standard game described here is the most well-known in literature and it is this version that became popular with French soldiers during and after the French-German war in 1870-71. (The variant is described in Scientific American, Oct. 1963, pp.124-130.)

Objective 
----------

One player controls the Hare counter while their opponent controls the three Hound counters. The Hare wins by successfully passing the three hounds and obtaining the position at the far left of the board. The Hounds win by surrounding and immobilizing the Hare counter.

Rules
------

*  Tpically, an even number of games are played with the two players alternating between controlling the Hare and controlling the Hounds.

*  Utilizing the opening position above, the Hare player moves first with turns alternating.

*  On the Hare's turn, that player may move their counter to any adjacent non-occupied node in any direction.

*  On the Hounds' turn, the player may move any single Hound counter straight forward (to the right on the board shown above), diagonally
   forward, or to either side, but never backwards.

*  Only one Hound counter may be moved per turn. There is no jumping or capturing of counters in this game.
