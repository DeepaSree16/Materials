GOATS AND TIGER
================

Description
------------

Bagha Chal, or "Moving Tiger", is an ancient Nepali board game, which has recently attracted attention among game fans under thename Tigers an Goats. It is a two-player game. 

In the game one player controls three tigers and the other player controls up to 15 goats. The tigers 'hunt' the goats while the goats attempt to block the tigers' movements.

Rules
------

* The game is played on a special board of 5 x 5 points connected orthogonally to form a grid. 

* There are also diagonal lines from corner to corner and diagonal lines connecting the midpoint on each side to the adjacent side's midpoints. 

* Before starting the game , all the 3 tigers are placed on the apex, and 2 inner places closest to the apex. All goats are placed at the starting off the board.

* The player controlling the goats moves first by placing a goat onto a free intersection on the board. 

* Then it is the tigers' turn. One tiger is then moved to an adjacent position along the lines that indicate the valid moves. Moves alternate between players.

* A tiger captures a goat by jumping over it to an adjacent free position (as in checkers). Goats can not move until all 15 have been put on the board.
