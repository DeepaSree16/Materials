Snakes and Ladders
==================

Introduction
------------

Snakes and Ladders is a quite simple racing board game derived from the
Indian game *Pachisi*. You probably have played it once or twice in your
childhood. It is also known as 'Moksha-Patamu.'

The goal of the game is to navigate your coin from start to finish, by
avoiding the snakes, and taking shortcuts going up the ladders.

Rules
-----

-  Each player puts their coin on the space that says 'start here' or 1.
-  Roll the dice. Move your coin forward the number of spaces shown on
   the dice.
-  If the coin lands on a top of the snake, the players coin will slide
   down to the bottom of the snake.
-  If the coin lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to
   the top of the ladder.
-  To win the player will need to roll the exact number to reach the
   last space. If the player rolls a higher number than needed to land
   exactly on 100, their coin does not move and remains there until
   their next turn, when they can roll again.
-  The first player reaching the highest space on the board, 100, wins
   the game.
