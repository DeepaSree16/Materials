BOUNCING BALL
==============

Description
------------

Bouncing Balls is a fun puzzle game where you have to match colored balls.

Rules
-----


* Shoot a ball, let it bounce and place it on the right spot. In this free Bouncing Balls game you are in charge of a simple task: remove the
  slowly advancing wall of brightly coloured balls before it reaches the line at the bottom of the screen.

* All it takes is to carefully aim your cannon at the wall, and fire orbs at them.
 
* If you manage to connect three or more of the same colour through a well-placed shot, they disappear. And if there are any additional balls
  hanging underneath them, those fall away, too. So shoot smart, use walls to bounce shots and clear each level.
