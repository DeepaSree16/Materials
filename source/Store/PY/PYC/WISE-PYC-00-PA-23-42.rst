Ludo
====

Introduction
------------

Ludo is a Latin word meaning "I play" derived from the Indian game
*Pachisi*, but simpler version. It is a strategy board game, for two to
four players, in which the players race their four coins from start to
finish according to dice rolls.

Rules
-----

-  Four coins are placed in the start area of player choice colour.
-  To begin the game, a player must roll a six to move a coin out of the
   start area and on to the starting square on the Ludo board. That coin
   is then in play.
-  The player cannot make any other moves until at least one coin is in
   play.
-  *Rules of the 6's*

   -  If a six is rolled, the player can choose to either move a coin
      out of his start area onto the starting square or move a coin that
      is in play.
   -  Anytime a six is rolled, the player gets an extra roll after his
      move.
   -  If a six is rolled three times in a row, the player loses his
      turn.
   -  If a player's coin lands on an opponent’s coin, the opponent’s
      coin is sent back to their start area where he must roll a six
      again in order to move it out onto the starting square of the Ludo
      board.

-  When a player’s die roll lands its coins on the home area, that piece
   has completed its journey.

-  The first player to have all four of his coins finish their journeys
   wins. The remaining players continue the game to determine the
   runner-ups.
