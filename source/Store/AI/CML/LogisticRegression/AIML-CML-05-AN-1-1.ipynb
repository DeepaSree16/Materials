The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n","\n","The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. \n","\n","* Preg: Number of times pregnant\n","* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test\n","* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\n","* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)\n","* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n","* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)\n","* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function\n","* Age: Age (years)\n","* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!wget https://cdn.iiith.talentsprint.com/aiml/Experiment_related_data/diabetes.csv"],"metadata":{"id":"yVCpeuzykG_B"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"--kkd7_VOi3B"},"source":["### Import required packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eiwZpWJJjJKJ"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GuY_5JzeyCvJ"},"source":["### Load the Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Cz9R5io5jY8h"},"source":["# Load the diabetes dataset\n","diabetes = pd.read_csv(\"diabetes.csv\")\n","\n","diabetes.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dDPh7oabjdrR"},"source":["# Extract features and labels\n","X = diabetes.drop(\"Outcome\",axis=1)\n","y = diabetes[\"Outcome\"]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bCeqM4ZLjgAR"},"source":["# Split the data into train and test data\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test  = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state=42)\n","print(X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HjrFKyQ4obCd"},"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n","X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X_train_scaled[0:5,:]"],"metadata":{"id":"Um958F42Y0vH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Apply Logistic Regression"],"metadata":{"id":"7WrFXVwV4jpU"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rCEXXazsjh4U"},"source":["LR = LogisticRegression()\n","LR.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n","y_pred = LR.predict(X_test_scaled)\n","print(\"Accuracy of Logistic Regression is:\",accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
