UNIT-1 Week-4 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

Choose the correct sequence of steps for k-fold cross-validation:

1. Use k-1 parts of the data for training and 1 part for validation to find error/performance metric 
2. Divide the sample data into k parts 
3. Repeat the cross-validation process ‘k’ times using a distinct part each time as test data.
4. Take an average of the ‘k’ number of results (error/performance metric) with distinct validation sets each time to produce the final result

Options:

A.2,1,3,4

B.1,2,3,4

C.3,1,2,4

D.4,1,3,2

**Answer: A**

**Question 2** 
 
Which of the following statements is/are incorrect about the BoW model? 
 
1. It is used in counting the number of word occurrences within a document 
2. It provides a vector representation of the document’s word frequency 
3. It helps in predicting new words using semantic relationships 
 
Options:  
 
A.Both 1 and 2 

B.Both 1 and 3 

C.Only 3 

D.Only 2 
 
**Answer: C** 

**Explanation:**  
Option A, B, D are correct. Option C is incorrect because the order of the words is not maintained and the context and meaning of the words is ignored in the bag of words. Henceforth, the semantic information will no longer be preserved, whereas the word2vec uses the semantic relationship between words.
 

**Question 3**
 
Which of the following statements is FALSE about Bag of words? 
 
Options: 
 
A.An ordered document representation 

B.An orderless document representation 

C.A frequency of word occurrences 

D.A simple representation used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
 
**Answer: A** 
 
**Explanation:**
The Bag-of-words model is an odorless document representation — only the counts of words matter. 


**Question 4** 
 
Features can be extracted using: 
 
Options: 
 
A.Hand-crafted, statistical and random representation      

B.Hand-crafted, learned and random representation 

C.Learned, statistical and distributed representation 

D.Hand-crafted, statistical and learned representation  
 
**Answer: D** 
 
**Explanation:**
Features that are manually engineered by the data scientist are referred to as handcrafted. Learned features are those that are obtained automatically from a machine learning algorithm. In the statistical representation the relationship between each input variable and the target variable is evaluated using statistics, and the input variables with the strongest relationship with the target variable are selected.
