Reduction**\n","\n","In Data Science and Machine Learning applications, we encounter different types of data, sizes, structure, format and complexities. The point of discussion in this section is related to large volumes of data with a large number of features. The main reason for such large number of features is owed to the application, and the process of data acquisition.\n","\n","In most applications, although there might be a large number of features, it might seem like more data gives better predictions.\n","\n","Counterintuitively, some features might be \n","\n","* redundant, \n","* having significant percent of missing observations\n","* uncorrelated to the target variable\n","* having low variance\n","* slowing down the ML model's learning capability\n","\n","To overcome the above disadvantages, we perform dimensionality reduction.\n","Dimensionality in the context of Tabular data refers to the number of features of the dataset. There are various ways to perform Dimensionality reduction. Some of the commonly used techniques are as follows.\n","\n","\n","- Lasso Regression\n","- Principal Component Analysis\n","- Independent Component Analysis\n","- Forward Feature Selection\n","- Backward Feature Elimination\n","- Missing Value Ratio\n","- Random Forest\n","- Factor Models\n","\n","But all the techniques cannot be applied to all the scenarios. For example, certain techniques work with linearly coorelated features only. So the applicability is case-by-case specific.\n","\n","For more information, please refer to the links: \n","\n","[Link 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342182637_A_Short_Survey_of_Dimensionality_Reduction_Techniques)\n","\n","[Link 2](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2078/QRM/DimensionReductionTechniques.pdf) \n","\n","[Link 3](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/tutorials/dimred-survey.pdf)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n","\n","PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine\n","the interrelations among dataset's features in order to identify the underlying structure of those features.\n","\n","PCA is the most sought-after Dimensionality reduction technique for linear. The reason is due to the fact that PCA has one of the best mean-square-error metrics. Under the hood, it employs Singular Value Decomposition popularly known as SVD. SVD is faster than other dimensionality reduction techniques, due to the Eigen-value Decomposition as the main part of its operation. PCA requires that the dataset must be standardized (zero mean and unit standard deviation)\n","\n","\n","PCA works as follows:\n","\n","- The user inputs the required number of dimensions/PCs $n$.\n","\n","- It seeks to reduce the dimension of the data by finding a few orthogonal linear combinations (the PCs) of the original variables with the largest variance. \n","\n","- The first PC, **$s_1$**, is the linear combination with\n","the largest variance. This is the most dominant PC, as it captures the maximum variance of the other features' linear combination.\n","\n","- The second PC, **$s_2$** is the linear combination with the second largest variance and orthogonal to the first PC, **$s_1$**.\n","\n","- The third PC, **$s_3$** is the linear combination with the third largest variance and orthogonal to the first and second PCs (**$s_1$** and **$s_2$**)\n","\n","- and so on upto the $n^{th}$ PC **$s_n$**.\n","\n","\n","One major disadvantage is that the actual features are reduced to just unkown variables. Example: If you have a Vehicle dataset with Cost, Engine_capacity, Number_of_cylinders, Number_of_bolts_1, Number_of_bolts_2, ....., then after applying PCA it will become s1, s2, etc. This is useful from the ML perspective, but from the Business perspective, these features that act as drivers to key-decision making would be lost.\n","\n","\n","\n","In the figure below, we see that 3 dimensions has been reduced to just 2.\n","\n","More information [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-clearly-explained-how-when-why-to-use-it-and-feature-importance-a-guide-in-python-7c274582c37e)\n","\n","![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*ba0XpZtJrgh7UpzWcIgZ1Q.jpeg)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FrlmCApO3mPp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####  Simple Regression base-model with train-test split"],"metadata":{"id":"DutSindjcsZ2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer\n","breast = load_breast_cancer()\n","breast_data = breast.data\n","breast_data.shape"],"metadata":{"id":"91xNtRZ4YDTz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["breast_labels = breast.target\n","breast_labels.shape"],"metadata":{"id":"ueaNi36EsBK-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","labels = np.reshape(breast_labels,(569,1))\n","final_breast_data = np.concatenate([breast_data,labels],axis=1)\n","\n","features = list(breast.feature_names)\n","cols = features + ['label']\n","breast_dataset = pd.DataFrame(final_breast_data, columns=cols)\n","\n","breast_dataset.sample(n=10)"],"metadata":{"id":"dBR0pn62sRUz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"rcmoAmZYtBs0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","x = breast_dataset.loc[:, features].values\n","x = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x) # normalizing the features\n","normalised_breast = pd.DataFrame(x,columns=features)\n","normalised_breast.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"95dmkxJVtsJc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","\n","n_pc = 2\n","cols_pc = []\n","for nth_pc in range(n_pc):\n","  cols_pc.append(f\"pc_{nth_pc+1}\")\n","\n","pca_breast = PCA(n_components=n_pc)\n","principalComponents_breast = pca_breast.fit_transform(x)\n","\n","principal_breast_Df = pd.DataFrame(data = principalComponents_breast, columns = cols_pc)\n","principal_breast_Df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"yCNxBOup_Wfs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Explained variation per principal component: {}'.format(pca_breast.explained_variance_ratio_))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Xv7WqHlzEjwI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["principal_breast_Df['pc_2']"],"metadata":{"id":"Jph9X-1jleB4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","\n","sns.scatterplot(principal_breast_Df['pc_1'], principal_breast_Df['pc_2'], hue=breast_dataset['label'])\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TfV7SiSrEy6O"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["principal_breast_Df['pc_1'][breast_dataset['label']]"],"metadata":{"id":"fw7dseYhFsTe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SJ5DncB5kh-p"},"source":["## Please answer the questions below to complete the experiment:\n","\n","Please find the eigen values using SVD transformation use numpy library \\begin{bmatrix}\n","1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n","5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n","3 & 7 & 8 & 9\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FZ4lftDtkoli"},"source":["#@title Select the correct options for eigen value { run: \"auto\", form-width: \"500px\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","Answer = \"\" #@param [\"\", \"[20.07711544,  1.80274635,  0.81212135]\", \"[14.07711544,  10.80274635,  5.81212135]\"]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"z_D9DlMOkoli"},"source":["#@title How was the experiment? { run: \"auto\", form-width: \"500px\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","Complexity = \"\" #@param [\"\",\"Too Simple, I am wasting time\", \"Good, But Not Challenging for me\", \"Good and Challenging for me\", \"Was Tough, but I did it\", \"Too Difficult for me\"]\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4U5zmlM1koli"},"source":["#@title If it was too easy, what more would you have liked to be added?
