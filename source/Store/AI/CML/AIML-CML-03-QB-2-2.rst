UNIT-1 Week-3 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1** 
 
A decision tree is built in which of the following fashion? 
 
Options: 

A.top down 

B.bottom up 
 
**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
A decision tree Algorithm is a type of supervised learning for classification problems.Classification is the process of dividing a data set into different categories or groups by adding a label(Ex-spam/no spam). Where the decision tree is built in the top down fashion
 
 
**Question 2**
 
When do you say that a model is Overfitting?  
 
Options: 
 
A.When the model has low accuracy score  on train data and low accuracy score on test data 
 
B.When the model has low accuracy score on train data and high accuracy score on test data
 
C.When the model has high accuracy score on train data and low accuracy score on test data 
 
D.When the model has high accuracy score on train data  and high accuracy score on test data
 
**Answer: C** 
 
**Explanation:** 
A model that is underfit will have low accuracy score on train data and  test data while an overfit model will have high accuracy score on train data but low accuracy score on test data.
 

**Question 3**
 
Imagine, you have 5000 features in the data given for a machine learning problem. You have to reduce it to 100 features so that you can capture most of the information (with minimal loss). Do you think this is an example of dimensionality reduction? 
 
Options: 
 
A.Yes 
 
B.No 
 
**Answer: A** 
 
**Explanation:**
The higher the number of features, the harder it gets to visualize the training set and then work on it. Sometimes, most of these features are correlated, and hence redundant. This is where dimensionality reduction algorithms come into play.
 
 
**Question 4**

Options 
 
A.H1 is the best line 

B.H2 is the best line 

C.H3 is the best line 
 
**Answer: B** 
 
**Explanation:**
 
H1 does, but only with a small margin. 

H2 separates them with the maximal margin, where the distance between the line and the closest data point is called margin and the best or optimal line that can separate the two classes is the line that has the maximum margin. The margin is calculated as the perpendicular distance from the line to only the closest points.

H3 does not separate the classes.
