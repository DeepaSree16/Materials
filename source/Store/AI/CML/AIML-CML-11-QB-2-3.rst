UNIT-2 Week-11 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1** 

Which of the following statements about the K-means clustering algorithm are TRUE?

1. The K-means clustering algorithm is sensitive to outliers
2. The elbow method is used to compute only the centroid value for each cluster at every iteration 
3. K-means is an iterative algorithm
4. For different initializations, the K-means algorithm will give the different clustering result.

Options:

A.1 and 2

B.2 and 4

C.1, 3 and 4

D.2, 3 and 4

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Statements 1, 3 and 4 are true. Statement 2 is False because the elbow method is used to compute the optimal number of clusters for the K-Means clustering.


**Question 2**

Which of the following is FALSE regarding Gradient descent?

Options:

A.It is an iterative optimization algorithm

B.It takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point, to move towards the minima of the function

C.It moves in the direction of steepest descent 

D.It is used to find the learning rate values for each iteration 

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** 
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minima of a differentiable function. It is used to find the values of a functionâ€™s parameter but not the learning rate. Learning rate is a hyper parameter to train a neural network for gradient descent.


**Question 3**

Options:

A.I-d, II-c, III-b, IV-a

B.I-d, II-c, III-a, IV-b

C.I-d, II-b, III-c, IV-a

D.I-a, II-c, III-d, IV-b

**Answer: B**

**Question 4**

Which of the following is FALSE regarding Deep Learning Networks?

A.They consist of many linear and non-linear operations

B.upon proper training low level semantic information(eg: edges and corners of the dog image) is obtained in its initial layers and high level semantic information is obtained in its later layers(more complex visual information for eg: faces of dogs, legs of dogs)

C.They generally require a low amount of training data

**Answer: C**


**Explanation:**
Deep learning neural networks require a large amount of data for training and it consists of linear and nonlinear functions depending on the architecture. The deep neural network has multiple layers to extract  high level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.
