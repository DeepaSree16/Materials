UNIT-1 Week-3 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

Options: 
 
A.Male  
 
B.Female 
 
**Answer: B** 

**Explanation:** 
Where Height = 140 cm, Weight = 65 kg based on the given condition it will classify as female because 140 is not greater than 180 so it will classify as NO then it will check with weight where weight 65 is less than 70 where it will classify as female
 
 
**Question 2**
 
Decision Tree classifier is a …………………… machine learning algorithm. 
 
Options: 
 
A.Supervised  
 
B.Unsupervised 
 
**Answer: A** 
 
**Explanation:**
Decision Trees classifier is a  supervised learning  machine learning algorithm which is used for both classification and regression tasks.where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees and where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.

 
**Question 3**
   
Support Vector Machines (SVM) find a separating hyperplane that---------- the margin between two classes 
 
Options: 
 
A.Minimizes 
 
B.Maximizes 
 
C.Overlaps 
 
D.None of the above 
 
**Answer: B** 
 
**Explanation:**

The objective is to maximize the margin under the constraints that all data points must lie on the correct side of the hyperplane.
 
 
 
**Question 4**
 
Select the correct statement. Reducing the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset helps to: 
 
Options: 
 
A.Visualize the data better 
 
B.Perform faster computations 
 
C.Reduce noise 
 
D.All the above 
 
**Answer: D** 
 
**Explanation:**
Some algorithms do not perform well when we have large dimensions. So reducing these dimensions needs to happen for better visualization of the data better, Perform faster computations and Reduce noise. so that the data is projected onto the lower dimension space such that the essential information in the data is preserved and noise is elminated.
