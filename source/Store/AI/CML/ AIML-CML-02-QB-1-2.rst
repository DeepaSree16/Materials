UNIT-1 Week-2 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================
 
**Question 1** 
 
What is the correct sequence of events in the Spam Detection of emails? 
 
1. Classification of emails into Spam and Non-spam via machine learning algorithms  
2. Collection of email contents as the raw data  
3. Feature extraction of keywords like Buy, Sell, Purchase, Offer 
 
Options: 
 
A.1, 2, 3 

B.3, 2, 1 

C.2, 3, 1 

D.1, 3, 2 
 
**Answer: C** 

**Explanation:**
For any machine learning algorithms,we initially collect the raw data , extract  the features from the raw data and then perform classification. 


**Question 2**
 
Arrange the correct order for k-NN?  
  
a.For each unknown sample find the distance from all the labeled samples 

b.Sort these labels by their distance from the unknown sample  

c.Identify the majority label  

d.Select the k labeled sample nearest to the unknown sample  

e.Assign the majority label to the unknown sample 

 
Options: 
 
A.a, b, c, d, e 

B.a, b, d, c, e 

C.c, d, e, a, b 
 
**Answer: B**

An unknown sample with black dot (at point 60,60) must now be labelled as blue or red. Find the distance between the unknown sample and all the labelled data points(red,blue) and Sort these labels by their distance from the unknown sample  
. Letâ€™s assume K = 3, which means it will find three data points that are closest to an unknown sample, as seen in the diagram. Among those three, two of them are very near to the Red class hence the black dot will be assigned to red class.


**Question 3**
 
A Linear classifier is a/an --------------------------Machine Learning Algorithm. 
 
Options:
 
A.Supervised 

B.Unsupervised 
 
**Answer: A** 

**Explanation:**
A Linear classifier classifies the data into labels based on a linear combination of input features. Therefore, Linear classifiers separate data using a line or plane.
 
 
**Question 4**
 
If the label has only two classes, the learning algorithm is a ------------ classifier 
 
Options: 
 
A.Binary 

B.Multi-class 

C.Both Binary and Multi-class  
 
**Answer: A** 
 
**Explanation:**
Binary classifier can  classify only two classes whereas multi-class classifiers can classify more than two classes.
