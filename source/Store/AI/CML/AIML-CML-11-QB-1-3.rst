UNIT-2 Week-11 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Which is the correct sequence of steps in the MFCC technique? 
1. Windowing - Each time frame is windowed to eliminate discontinuities at the edges.
2. FFT - Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is calculated for each frame to extract frequency components of a signal in the time domain.
3. Time frames - It consists of an arbitrary number of samples. 
4. Mel filter bank - Mel spectrum is computed by passing the Fourier transformed signal through a set of band-pass filters

Options:

A.1, 2, 3, 4

B.3, 1, 2, 4

C.3, 4, 2, 1

D.2, 4, 3, 1

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The correct sequence is 3,1,2,4 and the steps are given in  Foundation in speech processing pre-reading material.


**Question 2**

Which of the following statements about multi-layer perceptrons is FALSE? 

Options: 

A.It can have more than one hidden layer 

B.It can only do binary classification but not multi class classification

C.Activation function is applied in hidden layer and output layer 

**Answer: B** 

**Explanation:** 
MLP consists of three types of layers—the input layer, output layer and hidden layer; there can be more than one hidden layer. Where it is used for binary and multi class classification. Except for the input layer, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. 


**Question 3**

Which of the following techniques is used in obtaining Eigenfaces? 

Options:

A.Feature selection 

B.Principal Component Analysis 

C.Deep neural net 

D.Non-linear SVM 

**Answer: B** 

**Explanation:** 
This question is discussed inEigenfaces Preview video during the timeframe 12:00

**Question 4**

From the following confusion matrix,  if true positives are 100 and false negatives are 200, then the recall is

Hint: Precision = TP/ (TP+FP); Recall = TP/ (TP+FN); F1 Score = 2PR / P+R


Options:

A.1/4

B.2/3

C.1/2

D.1/3 

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**

Recall  (R)= 
T.P / T.P + F.N   = 100/100 + 200 =  ⅓
