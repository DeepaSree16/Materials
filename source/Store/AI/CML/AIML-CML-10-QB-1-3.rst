UNIT-2 Week-10 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1** 

Which of the following statement/s is/are TRUE? 

Options:

1. Given two features, if one increases, the other also increases. This is positive covariance. 

2. Given two features, if one increases, the other also increases. This is negative covariance. 

3. Given two features, if one increases, the other decreases. This is positive covariance. 

4. Given two features, if one increases, the other decreases. This is negative covariance. 


Options:

A.1 

B.2 

C.1 and 3

D.1 and 4

**Answer: D** 

**Explanation:** 
This question is discussed in Preview video during the timeframe 03:39-03-50


A positive value of covariance indicates both dimensions increase and decrease together 
e.g. as the number of hours studied increases, the marks in that subject increase.

A negative value indicates while one increases the other decreases, or vice-versa  
e.g. when the price is high, demand is less and when the price is less, demand is more


**Question 2**

PCA facilitates data visualization as: 

A.It is able to convert the entire data into the same unit of measurement 

B.It reduces the data to very low dimensions such as 2D or 3D 

C.It is able to determine the variance of some of the data points 

D.It is able to determine the correlation between all data points 

**Answer: B** 

**Explanation:** 
It is very hard to visualize and understand the data in high dimensions. PCA transforms high dimensional data to low dimensional data (2 or 3 dimensions) so that it can be visualized easily.



**Question 3**

Visually, in a 2D space, a separating hyperplane will be a _____ and in 3D space, it will be a _______ 

A.circle, line 

B.line, plane 

C.plane, circle 

D.line, cube 

**Answer: B** 

**Explanation:** 

A hyperplane is a generalization of a plane.

in one dimension, a hyperplane is called a point

in two dimensions, it is a line

in three dimensions, it is a plane

Thus for a space of n dimensions, we have a hyperplane of n-1 dimensions 


**Question 4**

Non-linear SVM may find a hyperplane that classifies linearly inseparable data by 

A.projecting the data into a lower dimension 

B.adding more training samples 

C.projecting the data into a higher dimension 

D.reducing the data dimensions 

**Answer: C** 

**Explanation:**
In the case of non-linearly separable data points SVM uses the kernel trick. The idea stems from the fact that if the data cannot be partitioned by a linear boundary in its current dimension, then projecting the data into a higher-dimensional space may make it linearly separable
