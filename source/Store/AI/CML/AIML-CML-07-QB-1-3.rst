Suppose we have 100 apples, 10 of them are bad. If the model predicts the following:-

only 87 of the good apples as good and only 8 of the bad apples as bad

What are the values of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives respectively?

Options:

A.87, 8, 2, 3

B.87, 8, 3, 2

C.8, 2, 87, 3

**Question 2**

Which of the following is true about cosine similarity?

1.  The cosine similarity of two parallel vectors is 1 

2.  The cosine similarity of two perpendicular vectors is 0

3.  The cosine similarity of two parallel vectors is 0

4.  The cosine similarity of two perpendicular vectors is 1

Options:

A.1 and 2

B.1 and 3

C.2 and 4

D.3 and 4

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:** 

Let us say there are two vectors A and B 

Suppose the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees. In that case, the cosine similarity will have a value of 0

The cosine similarity measurement gets closer to 1 when the angle between the two vectors A and B is smaller.


**Question 3**

Select the most appropriate option:

Word2Vec is best described as

Options:

A.A data structure that represents a group of words

B.An algorithm to figure out missing parts of a sentence

C.A representation of word that indicates/contains its semantic information

D.A sparse vector representation of words

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** 
Word2vec  is best described as a word that indicates/contains its semantic information because word2vec is the representation of a particular word in vector form which contains the semantic information which is learned from the context.


**Question 4**

Select the most appropriate option

Which of the following statements is/are incorrect?

Options:

A.POS tagging can label words only as nouns/ pronouns/ verbs

B.Tokenization is a process by which a large quantity of text is divided into smaller parts called tokens

C.Chunking is the process of grouping words that belong together.

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The option A is incorrect because there are more parts of speech available.  Where in the given option mentioned only 3 POS tags. We have adjectives, adverb, preposition, conjunction etc.
