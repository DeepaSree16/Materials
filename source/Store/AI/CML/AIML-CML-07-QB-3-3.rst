UNIT-2 Week-7 Weekly Test Question & Answers 
==============================================

**Question 1**

Assume that a Classifier C is used to classify the iris data(contains 3 class setosa,
Versicolor and Virginica of 150 samples.

According to the True labels:

samples that belong to Setosa = 50
samples that belong to Versicolor = 50
samples that belong to Virginica = 50

Predictions: In case of Setosa, 1 sample was misclassified as Versicolor and 1 as
Virginica and 48 were classified correctly

In case of Versicolor, 1 sample was misclassified as Setosa and 49 were classified
correctly

In case of Virginica, 2 samples were misclassified as Versicolor and 1 as Setosa
and 47 were classified correctly

Calculate the total number of True Positives, False Positives, False Negatives,
Precision, Recall for class Setosa

Options

A.TP = 48, FP = 2, FN = 2, Precision = 96%, Recall = 96%

B.TP = 49, FP = 3, FN = 1, Precision = 94%, Recall = 98%

C.TP = 47, FP = 1, FN = 3, Precision = 97%, Recall = 94%

**Answer: A**

**Question 2**

In confusion matrix, if true positives are 100 and false negatives are 200 and
false positives are 300 then the  F1- Score is

Options

A.0.284

B.0.36

C.0.16

D.0.5

**Answer: A**

**Question 3**

Read the following link on `Accuracy, Precision and Recall <https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it>`_ and answer the question
below:

Which of the following are true:

1. Accuracy is a good measure to use when the target variable classes in the
data are nearly balanced.

2. If we want to focus more on minimising False Negatives, we would want
our Recall to be as close to 100% as possible without precision being too
bad and if we want to focus on minimising False positives, then our focus
should be to make Precision as close to 100% as possible.

3. If we want to focus more on minimising False Negatives, we would want
our Precision to be as close to 100% as possible without precision being
too bad and if we want to focus on minimising False positives, then our
focus should be to make Recall as close to 100% as possible.

Options

A.1 and 2

B.2 and 3

C.1 and 3

D.1, 2, 3

**Answer: A**

**Question 4**

Read the following link on `word2vec <https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/word-embeddings-in-nlp-word2vec-glove-fasttext-24d4d4286a73>`_ and answer the question
below:

Which of the following statements is/are  true from the following?

1. Word Embeddings try to capture the semantic, contextual and syntactic meaning of each word in the corpus.
2. Word2vec takes in a large corpus of text as an input and produces a vector space with several hundreds dimensions.
3. Word2Vec doesn't solve the problem of context-specific meaning.

Options:

A.1 and 2

B.2 and 3

C.Only 3

D.1,2, and 3
