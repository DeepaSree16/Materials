A.2

B.3

C.4

D.5

**Answer: A**


**Question 2** 

Select the INCORRECT statement after reading this `article <https://towardsdatascience.com/t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne-bb60ff109561>`_ on t-SNE:


A.t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique where the focus is on keeping the very similar data points close together in lower-dimensional space.

B.The ‘crowding problem’ is prevented because t-SNE uses the student t-distribution to recreate the probability distribution in low-dimensional space

C.t-SNE Preserves the local structure of the data using student t-distribution

D.t-SNE linear dimensionality reduction technique where the focus is on keeping the dissimilar points far apart in a lower-dimensional space.

**Answer: D**

**Question 3**

An MNIST dataset comprising 10 classes, contains images of the size
28 X 28 (i.e,784 dimensions). Each image within the MNIST dataset is
plotted on a 2D space using different visualization techniques

Match these 2D image representations with their respective
visualization techniques

(Note that different classes are denoted by different colors)

A.t-SNE = a, ISOMAP =b, LLE= c

B.t-SNE = b, ISOMAP = c, LLE = a

C.t-SNE = b, ISOMAP= a, LLE = c

D.t-SNE = c, ISOMAP= b, LLE = a

Answer: A
