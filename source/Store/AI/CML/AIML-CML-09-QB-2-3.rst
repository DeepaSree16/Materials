UNIT-2 Week-9 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

tSNE is the technique for _________________that is particularly well
suited for the ___________ of High Dimensional Datasets.

Options:

A.introducing nonlinearity, visualisation

B.nonlinear dimensionality reduction, visualisation

C.expanding the dimensions, visualisation

D.introducing nonlinearity, reduction

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
t-SNE is a  dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high dimensional data (3D) to low dimensional space (2D).

**Question 2**

Identify the odd one out from PCA, tSNE, LLE, ISOMAP

Options:

A.LLE

B.ISOMAP

C.tSNE

D.PCA

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** 
PCA is a  Linear dimensionality reduction technique. Whereas  Isomap, TSNE, LLE are  non linear dimensionality reduction techniques(a flavor of Manifold Learning).
 
**Question 3**

Which of the following are TRUE regarding deep learnt features?

A.Features are deep learnt if the network has only one stage of non-linear feature transformation

B.Features are deep learnt if the network has more than one stage of non-linear feature transformation

C.Features are deep learnt if the network has more than one stage of linear feature transformation

D.Features are deep learnt if the network has at least 10 stages of non-linear feature transformation

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
For example when an image is given first it captures the low level features in the initial stages and then the mid-level features, high level features which can be given to the classifier it identify whether the given image is dog or car

**Question 4**

Which of the following is TRUE?

A.A spectrogram is a visual representation of MFCC features

B.A spectrogram is a visual representation of the amplitude of a signal as it varies with frequency

C.A spectrogram is a method to generate sound waves

D.A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform.
