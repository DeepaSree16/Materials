3. Select the option(s) that contain(s) the correct reasoning (explanation) for a given assertion (statement of fact):

 1. **Assertion**: 1% of the population of a country has COVID. In such a scenario, if a COVID medical diagnostic test (classifier) has 90% accuracy, it still may not be a reliable test
    
    **Reasoning**: Using plain accuracy is generally not enough for use as a performance measure for classifiers, especially for skewed datasets where some classes are more frequent than others

 2. **Assertion**: In fraud detection, we want to catch all the fraud cases, even if some non fraud cases are also flagged
    
    **Reasoning**: We prefer high recall even at the expense of low precision

 3. **Assertion**: F1 score will be high only when Precision and Recall are high
    
    **Reasoning**: F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall

Options:

A. Only 1 and 2
B. Only 1
C. Only 2 and 3
D. 1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D**

4. Find the equation of the straight line graph shown below, in the form y=mx+c (where m= slope, c= y-intercept):

.. image:: Images/M4_Q1_q4.png
    :width: 100px
    :align: center

Options:

A. y= 0.5x - 2
B. y= 2x - 1
C. y= 2x + 1
D. y= 4x - 1

**Answer: B**

**Solution:**

We know that c= y-intercept =  -1 (as seen from graph)
Slope m = change in y / change in x
Taking any two points on the graph: (2, 3) and (1,1),
Slope m = (3-1) / (2-1) = 2 / 1 = 2
Therefore the line equation is 2x - 1

5. Select the correct sequence of steps in a machine learning workflow:

 1. Explore different machine learning models and shortlist promising candidates
 2. Gather the data and do Data Munging/Wrangling for each subproblem
 3. Frame the ML problem by looking at the business need
 4. Fine-tune shortlisted models
 5. Deploy the model 
 6. Present your solution

Options:

A. 1-> 4-> 2-> 3-> 6-> 5
B. 3-> 2-> 1-> 4-> 6-> 5
C. 2-> 1-> 4-> 3-> 5-> 6
D. 1-> 3-> 4-> 2-> 5-> 6

**Answer: B**
