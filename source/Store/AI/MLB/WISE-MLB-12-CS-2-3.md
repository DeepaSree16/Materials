## Problem Description

All of us have thought about what factors make a movie successful. Commonly it is believed good directors, experienced actors, Public reviews and release time are important for success, but they do not always guarantee success. 

The dataset contains 5043 records with 12 attributes. The attributes are listed below : 

    * director_name

    * actor_2_name
    * gross
    * genres
        * actor_1_name

    * plot_keywords
        * language
    * budget
    * imdb_score

We want to analyze degree the success of a movie and on what kind of factors it depends on. The assignment is to identify and explain what kind of preprocessing needs to be performed and to predict the target variable. Provide visualizations where appropriate.
## Tasks

* Identify list of pre-processing tasks you want to do and why. 

    * This includes fixing anomalous data or removing them.

* Identify all the libraries you need to use. 

* Carry out data preparation tasks. 

* Provided appropriate visualizations 

* Identiy the target variable

* Use different algorithms to predict the target variable and report all the queries in a table format.

* Which algorithm you think is accurate to solve this problem?
