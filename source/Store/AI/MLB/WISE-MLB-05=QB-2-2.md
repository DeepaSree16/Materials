## Question 1

-------------- language models, in its essence, are the type of models that assign probabilities to the sequences of words.

1. Statistical
2. Classical
3. Probabilistic

> First option is correct

## Question 2

The simplest model that assigns probabilities to sentences and sequences of words is the -----------

1. N-grams
2. Bi-grams
3. Uni-grams

> First option is correct

## Question 3

How to measure the individual impact of the variables in logistic regression

1. Accuracy
2. Correlation
3. P-value

> Third option is correct

## Question 4

Predicted values of logistic regression line are:

1. Either 0 or 1 classes
2. Continuous values between 0 and 1
3. Continuous values between -1 and +1

> Second option is correct

## Question 5

To handle performance issues arising due to very large data-set in a production k-NN system, we can resort to

1. Dimensionality reduction
2. Data reduction
3. None of the above

> Second option is correct

## Question 6

Mark the correct statement with respect to gradient descent on a 1-d function:

1. In Gradient Descent, a negative gradient implies the minimum lies ahead (in the positive direction)
2. It really depends on the shape of the loss function
3. None of the above

> First option is correct

## Question 7

------------- is an example two-word sequence of words like “please turn”, “turn your”, or ”your homework”.

1. N-gram
2. Bi-gram
3. Tri-gram

> Second option is correct

## Question 8

An ------------- is a sequence of N tokens

1. Language Model
2. N-gram
3. Bag of Words

> Second option is correct

## Question 9

What are N-grams used for?

1. Removing Redundant Parameters
2. Data Augmentation
3. Text Mining and NLP

> Third option is correct

## Question 10

How to measure the association between two continuous variables

1. Use Standard deviations
2. Use Correlation coefficient
3. Use difference in medians

> Second option is correct

## Question 11

What is the difference between trees and logistic regression?

1. Decision Tree gives segment in which the customer falls, logistic regression gives the probability of each customer
2. There is no difference, both are used for binary prediction
3. Decision Tree gives segment in which the customer falls, logistic regression gives the probability of segment

> First option is correct

## Question 12

There are two classes in the output variable. A model predicts every new data point as class-1; Is it possible to have high accuracy of 99% for such a model

1. Accuracy is zero in such cases.
2. Such condition is Impossible
3. Yes possible

> Third option is correct

## Question 13

 The performance of the N-gram model varies with the change in the value of N

2. TRUE
3. FALSE

> First option is correct

## Question 14

A ---------------- is a three-word sequence of words like “please turn your”, or “turn your homework”

1. Uni-gram
2. Tri-gram
3. N-gram

> Second option is correct

## Question 15

The assumption that the probability of a word depends only on the previous word is also known as

1. Probability
2. Markov assumption
3. Maximum Likelihood

> Second option is correct

## Question 16

An ---------- language model predicts the probability of a given N-gram within any sequence of words in the language

1. Probability
2. Maximum Likelihood
3. N-gram

> Third option is correct

## Question 17

N-grams are a sparse representation of language. It will give zero probability to all the words that are not present in the training corpus

1. TRUE
2. FALSE

> First option is correct

## Question 18

If we have a good N-gram model, we can predict p(w | h) — what is the probability of seeing the word '*w*' given a history of previous words '*h*' — where the history contains n-1 words.

1. TRUE
2. FALSE

> First option is correct

## Question 19

---------------- tells us how to compute the joint probability of a sequence by using the conditional probability of a word given previous words.

1. Markov Assumption
2. Chain Rule
3. Maximum Likelihood

> Second option is correct

## Question 20

**P** (**to | the people who stand**) stands for:

1. the probability of occurrence of ‘to’ after ‘the people who stand’.
2. the probability of occurrence of ‘to’ before ‘the people who stand’.
3. None of the above

> First option is  correct
