## Question 5

To create visual dictionary, we only use train dataset.

1. TRUE
2. FALSE

> First option is correct

## Question 6

An Eigen face is:

1. A Matrix operation when manipulating images
2. A Matrix abstraction to identify faces in an image
3. A Mathematical abstraction to represent a ’standard’ face

> Third option is correct

## Question 7

2. Unsupervised
3. None of the above

> First option is correct

## Question 12

Arrange the following with respect to Bag of Visual Words

A. We extract local features from several images using SIFT.

B. Quantize the feature space. Make this operation via clustering algorithms such as K-means

C. Extract local features and compare these features with visual words to create histograms for each image both for the test and train dataset.

D. Predict the class of test images comparing with each histogram of train images. We will use 1-NN to predict the class of each test image.

1. C, D, A, B
2. B, C, A, D
3. A, B, C, D

> Third option is correct

## Question 13

In bag of visual words (BOVW), instead of words, we use image features as the “words”.

In Bag of Visual Words features consists of keypoints and descriptors

1. TRUE
2. FALSE

> First option is correct

## Question 16

We use the --------------- and -------------- to construct vocabularies and represent each image as a frequency histogram of features that are in the image

1. Keypoints, similar images
2. Keypoints, descriptors
3. None of the above

> Second option is correct
