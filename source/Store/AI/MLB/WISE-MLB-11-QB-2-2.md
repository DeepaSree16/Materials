## Question 1

In which of the following situations will a collaborative filtering system be the most appropriate learning algorithm (compared to linear or logistic regression)?

1. You’re an artist and hand-paint portraits for your clients. Each client gets a different portrait (of themselves) and gives you 1-5 star rating feedback, and each client purchases at most 1 portrait. You’d like to predict what rating your next customer will give you.
2. You own a clothing store that sells many styles and brands of jeans. You have collected reviews of the different styles and brands from frequent shoppers, and you want to use these reviews to offer those shoppers discounts on the jeans you think they are most likely to purchase
3. You manage an online bookstore and you have the book ratings from many users. You want to learn to predict the expected sales volume (number of books sold) as a function of the average rating of a book.

> Second option is correct

## Question 2

You run a movie empire, and want to build a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering. There were three popular review websites (which we’ll call A, B and C) which users to go to rate movies, and you have just acquired all three companies that run these websites. You’d like to merge the three companies’ datasets together to build a single/unified system. On website A, users rank a movie as having 1 through 5 stars. On website B, users rank on a scale of 1 - 10, and decimal values (e.g., 7.5) are allowed. On website C, the ratings are from 1 to 100. You also have enough information to identify users/movies on one website with users/movies on a different website. Which of the following statements is true?

1. Assuming that there is at least one movie/user in one database that doesn’t also appear in a second database, there is no sound way to merge the datasets, because of the missing data.
2. You can merge the three datasets into one, but you should first normalize each dataset’s ratings (say rescale each dataset’s ratings to a 0-1 range).3. You can combine all three training sets into one as long as your perform mean normalization and feature scaling after you merge the data.

> Second option is correct

## Question 3

Recommender systems can be defined as:

1. Systems that evaluate quality based on the preferences of others 
with a similar point of view
2. Systems that evaluate quality based on the purchase history of any
particular person only
3. Systems that evaluate quality based on the demand of items
4. Systems that evaluate quality based on the association rule mining 

> First option is correct

## Question 4

Identify the incorrect statement related to Collaborative Filtering

1. Recommend the ‘best’ items based on the user’s previous likings and the opinions of like-minded users whose ratings are similar
2. The problem of collaborative filtering is to predict how well a user will like an item that he has not rated given a set of historical preference judgments for a community of users
3. It is impractical to base a query on all the items in content based
method

> Third option is correct

## Question 5

Identify the incorrect statement, which are used to collect the data for recommender systems

1. Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
2. Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
3. Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
4. Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes

> Fourth option is correct

## Question 6

Identify the incorrect statements related to recommender system

1. An information filtering technology, commonly used on ecommerce Web sites that uses a collaborative filtering to present information on items and products that are likely to be of interest to the reader.
2. In presenting the recommendations, the recommender system will use details of the registered user's profile and opinions and habits of their whole community of users and compare the information to reference characteristics to present the recommendations.
3. None of these

> Third option is correct

## Question 7

Which of the following is not challenge of collaborative filtering?

1. Modularity
2. Data sparsity
3. Scalability
4. Shilling attacks

## Question 8

Which of the following is not use of collaborative filtering?

1. News reader services on web
2. Recommend interesting or popular information as judged by the community.
3. Can be used for user profiling and helps the site recommend content that submitted by other users similar to your taste, or you find interesting, as well as topics that you usually vote up and follow.
