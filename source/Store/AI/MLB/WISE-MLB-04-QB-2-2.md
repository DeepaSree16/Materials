## Question 24

Which of the following statement is incorrect about PCA?

1. Measures how each variable is associated with one another using a Covariance matrix
2. Understands the directions of the spread of our data using eigen values
3. Principal component analysis is a technique for feature extraction — so it combines our input variables in a specific way, then we can drop the “least important” variables while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables! As an added benefit, each of the “new” variables after PCA are all independent of one another.
