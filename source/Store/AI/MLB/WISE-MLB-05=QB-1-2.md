## Question 2

When do we go for logistic regression instead of linear regression

2. When there is a binary output
3. When R-square is very less

Which of the following is a reasonable way to select the number of principal components "k"?

1. Choose k to be the largest value so that 99% of the variance is retained
2. Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the varinace is retained
3. Use the elbow method

## Question 15

Suppose you have trained a logistic regression classifier and it outputs a new example x with a prediction ho(x) = 0.2. This means
