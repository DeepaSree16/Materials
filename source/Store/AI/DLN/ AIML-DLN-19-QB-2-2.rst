**Question 1**

Calculate a 3-year simple moving average for the year 2017?

.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25 
   :header-rows: 1
    
   * - Year
     - Sales
     
     - 2013, 22
     - 2014, 24
     - 2015, 26
     - 2016, 28 

Options:

A.22

B.24

C.26

D.27

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** Take the average of last 3 year sales = (24 + 26 + 28) / 3 = 26

**Question 2**

Pick the right sequence for the framework of ARIMA time series modeling from the following steps:

1. Build the ARIMA model
2. Visualize the time series
3. Plot ACF/PACF charts and find the optimal parameters
4. Stationarize the time series
5. Make predictions

Options:

A.1, 2, 3, 4, 5

B.2, 4, 3, 1, 5

C.5, 4, 3, 2, 1

D.2, 1, 3, 4, 5

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The correct sequence for the framework of ARIMA time series modeling:

1. Visualize the time series
2. Stationarize the time series
3. Plot ACF/PACF charts and find the optimal parameters
4. Build the ARIMA model
5. Make predictions



**Question 3**

Which of the following statements is/are TRUE about LSTM?

Options

A.LSTM has three gates to control the cell state.

B.LSTM is capable of learning short term dependencies as well as long term dependencies.

C.LSTMs are designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
There are three different gates in an LSTM cell: a forget gate, an input gate, and an output gate. It is capable of learning long-term dependencies and is designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.
