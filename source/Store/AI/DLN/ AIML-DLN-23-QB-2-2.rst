UNIT-4 Week-23 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Mark the correct statements
1. Regularization reduces chances of over-fitting with the help of an additional penalty in the loss function
2. Dropout is an approach to regularize neural networks, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons
3. While training with Dropout, some number of neurons in the network are randomly removed in every epoch

Options:

A.Both 1 and 2

B.Both 1 and 3

C.Both 2 and 3

D.1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
In machine learning, Regularization reduces over-fitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. Dropout helps in reducing interdependent learning amongst the neurons and it randomly drops neurons from the neural network during training in each iteration. 



**Question 2**

Which of the following are the applications of Computer vision?

A.Health care (eg: pneumonia Detection)

B.Sports (eg: Ball Tracking)

C.Transportation (eg: Pedestrian Detection)

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**
 
 
**Question 3**
 
Which of the following deep learning architecture is designed for sequential data like time series? 

Options 

A.RNN 

B.CNN 

C.Autoencoders

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:** 
The idea behind RNNs is to make use of sequential information. In a traditional neural network we assume that all inputs (and outputs) are independent of each other.
