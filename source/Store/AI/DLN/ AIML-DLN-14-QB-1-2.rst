UNIT-3 Week-14 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

Choose the correct sequence of steps for k-fold cross-validation:

1. Use k-1 parts of the data for training and 1 part for validation to find error/performance metric 
2. Divide the sample data into k parts 
3. Repeat the cross-validation process ‘k’ times using a distinct part each time as test data.
4. Take an average of the ‘k’ number of results (error/performance metric) with distinct validation sets each time to produce the final result

Options:

A.2,1,3,4

B.1,2,3,4

C.3,1,2,4

D.4,1,3,2

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
This question is discussed in the Preview video during the timeframe: 33s -  3mins 17s


**Question 2**

Select the correct statement(s) regarding K-Fold cross-validation:

1. All samples in the dataset are part of a validation subset at least once
2. Training and validation is repeated k-1 times
3. Training and validation is repeated k times 

Options:

A.Only 1

B.1 and 3

C.Only 2

D.2 and 3

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Statements A and C are True. Statement B is False. wherein k fold cross-validation training and validation is repeated for k times


**Question 3**

Select the TRUE statement w.r.t. Overfitting:

1. If the model overfits, it cannot generalize well on new data
2. If the model overfits, it can generalize well on new data
3. If the model overfits, it has memorized the training data

Options:

A.Only 1

B.Only 2

C.1 and 3

D.2 and 3

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Statements 1 and 3 are True. When the model is overfitted, It means that the model has memorized the training data and can’t generalize well on the new data.


**Question 4**

Which of the following are True w.r.t. Leave one out:

1. Leave one out is a special case of K-Fold cross-validation i.e. n-fold cross-validation (n = total number of data samples in the dataset)
2. Leave one out provides a noisy estimate of the model’s performance
3. All samples in the dataset are used at least for a single time for validation

Options:

A.1, 3

B.2, 3

C.2, 1

D.1, 2, 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
This question is discussed in the Preview video during the timeframe: 3min 18s - 4mins 50s
