        "These images do not come with labels, but CycleGANs give us a way to learn the mapping between one image domain and another using an unsupervised approach. A CycleGAN is designed for image-to-image translation and it learns from unpaired training data. This means that in order to train a generator to translate images from domain $X$ to domain $Y$, we do not have to have exact correspondences between individual images in those domains. For example, in the paper that introduced CycleGANs, the authors are able to translate between images of horses and zebras (for Example), even though there are no images of a zebra in exactly the same position as a horse or with exactly the same background, etc. Thus, CycleGANs enable learning a mapping from one domain $X$ to another domain $Y$ without having to find perfectly-matched, training pairs!\n",

        "We've seen that regular GANs treat the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we'll use a least squares loss function for the discriminator. This structure is also referred to as a least squares GAN or LSGAN, and you can [read the original paper on LSGANs, here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04076.pdf). The authors show that LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs and that this loss type is a bit more stable during training! \n",

        "\n",
        "The discriminator losses will be mean squared errors between the output of the discriminator, given an image, and the target value, 0 or 1, depending on whether it should classify that image as fake or real. For example, for a *real* image, `x`, we can train $D_X$ by looking at how close it is to recognizing and image `x` as real using the mean squared error:\n",

        "\n",
        "Calculating the generator losses will look somewhat similar to calculating the discriminator loss; there will still be steps in which you generate fake images that look like they belong to the set of $X$ images but are based on real images in set $Y$, and vice versa. You'll compute the \"real loss\" on those generated images by looking at the output of the discriminator as it's applied to these _fake_ images; this time, your generator aims to make the discriminator classify these fake images as *real* images. \n",

        "\n",
        "In addition to the adversarial losses, the generator loss terms will also include the **cycle consistency loss**. This loss is a measure of how good a reconstructed image is, when compared to an original image. \n",
        "\n",
        "Say you have a fake, generated image, `x_hat`, and a real image, `y`. You can get a reconstructed `y_hat` by applying `G_XtoY(x_hat) = y_hat` and then check to see if this reconstruction `y_hat` and the orginal image `y` match. For this, we recommed calculating the L1 loss, which is an absolute difference, between reconstructed and real images. You may also choose to multiply this loss by some weight value `lambda_weight` to convey its importance.\n",

For example, the image below depicts real images in the $Y$ set, and the corresponding generated images during different points in the training process. You can see that the generator starts out creating very noisy, fake images, but begins to converge to better representations as it trains (though, not perfect).\n",
