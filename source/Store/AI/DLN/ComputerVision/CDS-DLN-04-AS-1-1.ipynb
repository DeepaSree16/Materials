What is the curse of dimensionality?\n","\n"," The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that many problems that do not\n","exist in low-dimensional space arise in high-dimensional space. In Machine\n","Learning, one common manifestation is the fact that randomly sampled high-dimensional vectors are generally very sparse, increasing the risk of overfitting and making it very difficult to identify patterns in the data without having plenty of training data.\n","\n","3. Once a datasetâ€™s dimensionality has been reduced, is it possible to reverse the operation? If so, how? If not, why?\n","\n"," Once a datasetâ€™s dimensionality has been reduced using one of the algorithms we\n","discussed, it is almost always impossible to perfectly reverse the operation,\n","because some information gets lost during dimensionality reduction. Moreover,\n","while some algorithms (such as PCA) have a simple reverse transformation\n","procedure that can reconstruct a dataset relatively similar to the original, other algorithms (such as t-SNE) do not.\n","\n","4. Can PCA be used to reduce the dimensionality of a highly nonlinear dataset?\n","\n"," PCA can be used to significantly reduce the dimensionality of most datasets, even if they are highly nonlinear, because it can at least get rid of useless dimensions. However, if there are no useless dimensions, as in a Swiss roll dataset, then reducing dimensionality with PCA will lose too much information. You want to unroll the Swiss roll, not squash it.\n","\n","5. Suppose you perform PCA on a 1,000-dimensional dataset, setting the explained\n","variance ratio to 95%. How many dimensions will the resulting dataset have?\n","\n"," Thatâ€™s a trick question: it depends on the dataset. Letâ€™s look at two extreme examples. First, suppose the dataset is composed of points that are almost perfectly aligned. In this case, PCA can reduce the dataset down to just one dimension while still preserving 95% of the variance. Now imagine that the dataset is composed of perfectly random points, scattered all around the 1,000 dimensions. In this case roughly 950 dimensions are required to preserve 95% of the variance. So the answer is, it depends on the dataset, and it could be any number between 1 and 950. Plotting the explained variance as a function of the number of dimensions is one way to get a rough idea of the datasetâ€™s intrinsic dimensionality.\n","\n","6. How can you evaluate the performance of a dimensionality reduction algorithm\n","on your dataset?\n","\n"," Intuitively, a dimensionality reduction algorithm performs well if it eliminates a lot of dimensions from the dataset without losing too much information. One way to measure this is to apply the reverse transformation and measure the reconstruction error. However, not all dimensionality reduction algorithms provide a reverse transformation. Alternatively, if you are using dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step before another Machine Learning algorithm (e.g., a Random Forest classifier), then you can simply measure the performance of that second algorithm; if dimensionality reduction did not lose too much information, then the algorithm should perform just as well as when using the original dataset."]}]}
