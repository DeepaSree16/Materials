UNIT-3 Week-15 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

A ------- is a  fully connected neural network layer where each input node is connected to each node in the next layer

Options:

A.Pooling layer

B.Dense layer

C.Flatten layer

D.Activation layer

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The options A, C and D are incorrect. The correct answer is B.

* Dense Layer: The dense layer is a fully connected neural network layer where each input node is connected to each node in the next layer.

* Flatten layer: Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector. 

* Pooling layer: It is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map.

* Activation layer:An activation function in a neural network defines how the weighted sum of the input is transformed into an output from a node or nodes in a layer of the network



**Question 2**

Which of the following algorithms can be used to find similar users in recommendation systems?

1. k-Means
2. k-Medoids
3. k-Nearest Neighbors

Options: 

A.Only 1

B.Both 1 and 2

C.Both 1 and 3

D.1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D** 

**Explanation:**
The correct answer is D. K-Means, k-Medoids, k-Nearest Neighbors are used to find similar users in recommendation systems. 

**Question 3** 

The evaluation goals of recommendation systems are based on which of the following? 

1. Prediction Power
2. Classification accuracy 
3. Novelty and Exploration ability 

Options:

A.1 and 2

B.2 and 3

C.1 and 3

D.1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
Most evaluation goals of recommendation systems are based on 

Prediction Power: The ability to accurately predict the user Choices

Classification accuracy: The ability to differentiate between good items from bad ones

Novelty and Exploration ability: Discovering new items  and exploring diverse items


**Question 4**

Which of the following statements is/are True about RNNs?

1. RNNs are suitable for processing data like speech or text with rich contextual information available in the sequence
2. RNNs use information obtained from the previous state (hidden state) and is passed to current time step
3. RNN can be used for predicting the next letter or word given previous context (previous words or letters in the sentence).

Options:

A.Only 1

B.1 and 2

C.Only 2

D.1, 2 and 3 

**Answer: D**

**Explanation**

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of machine learning algorithm that are ideal for sequential data such as text, time series, financial data, speech, audio, video. from the previous RNN state and the input is passed to the current time step, predict the class of the next character.
