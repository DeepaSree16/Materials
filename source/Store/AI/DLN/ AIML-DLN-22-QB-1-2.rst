UNIT-4 Week-22 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Siamese networks consist of ……….  identical neural networks.

Options:

A.One 

B.Two / More than one

C.Zero

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A Siamese neural network consists of two or more identical subnetworks.

**Question 2**

Which of the following statements are True about how siamese loss learns the weights of images? 

1. Extracted features of similar images (neighbors) are  pushed apart in feature space
2. Extracted features of  dissimilar images (non-neighbors) are pulled together in feature space
3. Extracted features of similar images (neighbors) are pulled together in feature space
4. Extracted features of dissimilar images (non-neighbors) are pushed apart in feature space

Options:

A.Both 1 and 2

B.Both 3 and 4

C.Both 1 and 3

D.Both 1 and 4 

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Similar images features are pulled together in feature space and dissimilar images are pushed apart in feature space.


**Question 3**

Select the most appropriate option. 

Which of the following statements is/are False about Siamese architecture?

Options:

A.Trains on the pairwise labels of the images 

B.Consists of two neural networks with shared weights 

C.Consists of two neural networks with different weights 

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
A Siamese neural network is an artificial neural network that contains two or more identical subnetworks which means they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights.


**Question 4**

State True or False: Siamese network learns to find the similarity between the two inputs instead of classifying the inputs.

A.True

B.False

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Instead of classifying the inputs, the Siamese network learns to detect similarities between them.
