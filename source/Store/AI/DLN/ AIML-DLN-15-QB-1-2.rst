a.Keras is a higher-level API and Pytorch is a lower-level API

b.Keras is  lower-level API and  Pytorch is higher-level API

c.Enabling GPU acceleration is handled implicitly in Keras

d.PyTorch requires us to specify when to transfer data between the CPU and GPU

Options:

A.a, c, d

B.b, c, d

C.b and d

D.b and c


**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
This question is discussed in Preview video during the timeframe: 1min 16s -  3min 13s

This question is discussed in the Preview video during the timeframe: 2min 30s - 3min 07s



**Question 3**

During the train time, RNNs use different sets of weights for inputs of different timesteps 

Options:

A.True

B.False

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
RNN uses the same set of weights at each time step. While reading a sequence, if the RNN model uses different parameters for each step during training, it won't generalize to unseen sequences of different lengths.

**Question 4**
  
Which of the following statements are true for Item-Based Nearest Neighbor Algorithms? 

1. Generate predictions based on similarities between items
2. The prediction of an item is based on user’s ratings for similar items
3. It doesn’t consider the user’s preferences
 
Options:

A.1 and 2

B.2 and 3

C.1 and 3

D.1, 2 and 3
