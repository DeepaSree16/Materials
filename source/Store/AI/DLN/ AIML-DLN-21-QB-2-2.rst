UNIT-4 Week-21 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Which of the following statements is/are TRUE?

Options:

A.VGG-16 has more number of parameters than ResNet

B.The computational time of ResNet is lesser than that of VGG-16

C.AlexNet and ResNet-152, both have about 60M parameters but there is about 10% difference in their top-5 accuracy

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
VGG-16 has roughly 138 million parameters and ResNet has 25.5 million parameters and the computational time of ResNet is lesser than that of VGG-16.

**Question 3**

Select the most appropriate option.

Reinforcement Learning is ______

Options

A.Supervised Learning

B.Unsupervised Learning

C.Reward based Learning 

D.Deep Learning
 

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Reinforcement Learning is a reward based learning

**Question 4**
 
Which of the following is FALSE about Reinforcement Learning?

Options:

A.Reinforcement learning can solve only simple problems

B.Reinforcement has 2 major components - Agent and Environment

C.Reinforcement learning helps agent learn using feedback from the action(s) taken in the absence of a training dataset.

D.Reinforcement learning does not require a network trainer or a supervisor
 
**Answer: A**

**Explanation:** 
Reinforcement learning is used mainly to solve complex problems that enables agent to learn from the feedback provided by the environment. This is achieved in the absence of a training dataset as it is bound to learn from its experience

**Question 5**

Choose the correct order for the Reinforcement Learning process

a.Agent takes an action in response to that state

b.Environment sends a state to the agent say the current state

c.Agent evaluates the last action and feedback received to update its knowledge

d.Environment sends the next state and respective reward to the agent

e.Loop continues until the Environment sends a terminal state
 
Options:

A.a-d-c-b-e

B.b-a-d-c-e

C.b-c-a-d-e

D.a-b-c-d-e

**Answer: B**
