Below are the details:\n","\n","1. The dataset contains 60,000 Handwritten digits as training samples and 10,000 Test samples, \n","which means each digit occurs 6000 times in the training set and 1000 times in the testing set. (approximately). \n","2. Each image is Size Normalized and Centered \n","3. Each image is 28 X 28 Pixel with 0-255 Gray Scale Value. \n","4. That means each image is represented as 784 (28 X28) dimension vector where each value is in the range 0- 255.\n","\n","### History\n","\n","Yann LeCun (Director of AI Research, Facebook, Courant Institute, NYU) was given the task of identifying the cheque numbers (in the 90â€™s) and the amount associated with that cheque without manual intervention. That is when this dataset was created which raised the bars and became a benchmark.\n","\n","Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes (Google Labs, New York) hold the copyright of MNIST dataset, which is a subset of the original NIST datasets. This dataset is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license. \n","\n","It is the handwritten digits dataset in which half of them are written by the Census Bureau employees and remaining by the high school students.
