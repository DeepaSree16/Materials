Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make sound business decisions and predict short-term or long-term performance. Forecasts could be based on data such as past sales, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.\n","\n","\n","A leading retailer in the USA wants to forecast sales for their product categories in their store, based on the sales history of each category. Sales or revenue forecasting is very important for retail operations. Forecasting of retail sales helps the retailer to take necessary measures to plan their budgets or investments in a period (monthly, yearly) among different product categories like women's clothing, men's clothing, and other clothing. Further, they can plan to minimize revenue loss from the unavailability of products by investing accordingly.\n","\n","**Note: This data is proprietary. Please DO NOT share the dataset with anyone.
