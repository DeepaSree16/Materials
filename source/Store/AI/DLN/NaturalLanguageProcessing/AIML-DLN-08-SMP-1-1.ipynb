But then things are as our eyes see them and as our minds make\\r\\nthem; and it is thus of primary importance for the critic to distinguish\\r\\nthe precise qualities of the eyes and minds which make the world into\\r\\nimaginative literature. Reality may be so definite and so false, just as\\r\\nit may be so fantastic and so true; and, among work which we can\\r\\napprehend as dealing justly with reality, there may be quite as much\\r\\ndifference in all that constitutes outward form and likeness as there is\\r\\nbetween a Dutch interior by Peter van der Hooch, the portrait of a king\\r\\nby Velasquez, and the image of a woman smiling by Leonardo da Vinci. The\\r\\nsoul, for instance, is at heart as real as the body; but, as we can hear\\r\\nit only through the body speaking, and see it only through bodily eyes,\\r\\nand measure it, often enough, only in the insignificant moment of its\\r\\naction, it may come to seem to us, at all events less realizable; and\\r\\nthus it is that we speak of those who have vividly painted exterior\\r\\nthings as realists. Properly speaking, Maupassant is no more a realist\\r\\nthan Maeterlinck. He paints a kind of reality which it is easier for us\\r\\nto recognize; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery artist has his own vision of the world. Maupassant\\'s vision was of\\r\\nsolid superficies, of texture which his hands could touch, of actions\\r\\nwhich his mind could comprehend from the mere sight of its incidents.\\r\\nHe saw the world as the Dutch painters saw it, and he was as great a\\r\\nmaster of form, of rich and sober color, of the imitation of the outward\\r\\ngestures of life, and of the fashion of external things. He had the same\\r\\nview of humanity, and shows us, with the same indifference, the same\\r\\nviolent ferment of life--the life of full-blooded people who have to\\r\\nelbow their way through the world. His sense of desire, of greed, of all\\r\\nthe baser passions, was profound: he had the terrible logic of\\r\\nanimalism. Love-making, drunkenness, cheating, quarreling, the mere\\r\\nidleness of sitting drowsily in a chair, the gross life of the farmyard\\r\\nand the fields, civic dissensions, the sordid provincial dance of the\\r\\nseven deadly sins, he saw in the same direct, unilluminating way as the\\r\\nDutch painters; finding, indeed, no beauty in any of these things, but\\r\\ngetting his beauty in the deft arrangement of them, in the mere act of\\r\\nplacing them in a picture. The world existed for him as something\\r\\nformless which could be cut up into little pictures. He saw no farther\\r\\nthan the lines of his frame. The interest of the thing began inside that\\r\\nframe, and what remained outside was merely material.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story of Maupassant, more than almost anything in the world, gives you\\r\\nthe impression of manual dexterity. It is adequately thought out, but it\\r\\ndoes not impress you by its thought; it is clearly seen, but it does not\\r\\nimpress you specially by the fidelity of its detail; it has just enough\\r\\nof ordinary human feeling for the limits it has imposed on itself. What\\r\\nimpresses you is the extreme ingenuity of its handling; the way in which\\r\\nthis juggler keeps his billiard-balls harmoniously rising and falling in\\r\\nthe air. Often, indeed, you cannot help noticing the conscious smile\\r\\nwhich precedes the trick, and the confident bow which concludes it. He\\r\\ndoes not let you into the secret of the trick, but he prevents you from\\r\\nignoring that it is after all, only a trick which you have been\\r\\nwatching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a philosophy of one kind or another behind the work of every\\r\\nartist. Maupassant\\'s was a simple one, sufficient for his needs as he\\r\\nunderstood them, though perhaps really consequent upon his artistic\\r\\nmethods, rather than at the root of them. It was the philosophy of\\r\\ncynicism: the most effectual means of limiting one\\'s outlook, of\\r\\nconcentrating all one\\'s energies on the task in hand. Maupassant wrote\\r\\nfor men of the world, and men of the world are content with the wisdom\\r\\nof their counting-houses. The man of the world is perfectly willing to\\r\\nadmit that he is no better than you, because he takes it for granted\\r\\nthat you will admit yourself to be no better than he. It is a way of\\r\\navoiding comparison. To Maupassant this cynical point of view was\\r\\ninvaluable for his purpose. He wanted to tell stories just for the\\r\\npleasure of telling them; he wanted to concern himself with his story\\r\\nsimply as a story; incidents interested him, not ideas, nor even\\r\\ncharacters, and he wanted every incident to be immediately effective.\\r\\nNow cynicism, in France, supplies a sufficient basis for all these\\r\\nrequirements; it is the equivalent, for popular purposes, of that appeal\\r\\nto the average which in England is sentimentality. Compare, for\\r\\ninstance, the admirable story \"Boule de Suif,\" perhaps the best story\\r\\nwhich Maupassant ever wrote, with a story of somewhat similar\\r\\nmotive--Bret Harte\\'s \"Outcasts of Poker Flat.\" Both stories are\\r\\npathetic; but the pathos of the American (who had formed himself upon\\r\\nDickens, and in the English tradition) becomes sentimental, and gets its\\r\\nsuccess by being sentimental; while the pathos of the Frenchman (who has\\r\\nformed himself on Flaubert, and on French lines) gets its success\\r\\nprecisely by being cynical.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the particular variety of Maupassant\\'s cynicism was just that\\r\\nvariation of the artistic idea upon the temperament which puts the best\\r\\nfinish upon work necessarily so limited, obliged to be so clenching, as\\r\\nthe short story. Flaubert\\'s gigantic dissatisfaction with life, his\\r\\nreally philosophic sense of its vanity, would have overweighted a writer\\r\\nso thoroughly equipped for his work as the writer of \"Boule de Suif\" and\\r\\n\"La Maison Tellier.\" Maupassant had no time, he allowed himself no\\r\\nspace, to reason about life; the need was upon him to tell story after\\r\\nstory, each with its crisis, its thrill, its summing up of a single\\r\\nexistence or a single action. The sharp, telling thrust that his\\r\\nconception of art demanded could be given only by a very specious, not\\r\\nvery profound, very forthright, kind of cynicism, like the half kindly,\\r\\nhalf contemptuous laugh of the man who tells a good story at the club.\\r\\nFor him it was the point of the epigram.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaupassant was the man of his period, and his period was that of\\r\\nNaturalism. In \"Les Soirees de Medan,\" the volume in which \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\" appeared, there is another story called \"Sac au Dos,\" in which\\r\\nanother novelist made his appearance among the five who \"publicly\\r\\naffirmed their literary tendencies\" about the central figure of Zola. J.\\r\\nK. Huysmans, then but at the outset of his slow and painful course\\r\\nthrough schools and experiments, was in time to sum up the new\\r\\ntendencies of a new period, as significantly as Maupassant summed up in\\r\\nhis short and brilliant, and almost undeviating career, the tendencies\\r\\nof that period in which Taine and science seemed to have at last found\\r\\nout the physical basis of life. Now it is a new realism which appeals to\\r\\nus: it is the turn of the soul. The battle which the \"Soirees de Medan\"\\r\\nhelped to win has been won; having gained our right to deal with humble\\r\\nand unpleasant and sordidly tragic things in fiction, we are free to\\r\\nconcern ourselves with other things. But though the period has passed,\\r\\nand will not return, the masterpieces of the period remain. Among these\\r\\nmasterpieces are the novels and short stories of Guy de Maupassant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 ARTHUR SYMONS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOULE DE SUIF\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days, straggling remnants of the routed army had passed\\r\\nthrough the town. There was no question of organized troops, it was\\r\\nsimply a disjointed rabble, the men unshaven and dirty, their uniforms\\r\\nin tatters, slouching along without regimental colors, without\\r\\norder--worn out, broken down, incapable of thought or resolution,\\r\\nmarching from pure habit and dropping with fatigue the moment they\\r\\nstopped. The majority belonged to the militia, men of peaceful pursuits,\\r\\nretired tradespeople, sinking under the weight of their accouterments;\\r\\nquick-witted little moblets as prone to terror as they were to\\r\\nenthusiasm, as ready to attack as they were to fly; and here and there a\\r\\nfew red trousers, remnants of a company mowed down in one of the big\\r\\nbattles; somber-coated artillerymen, side by side with these various\\r\\nuniforms of the infantry, and now and then the glittering helmet of a\\r\\nheavily booted dragoon who followed with difficulty the march of the\\r\\nlighter-footed soldiers of the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies of franc-tireurs, heroically named \"Avengers of the Defeat,\"\\r\\n\"Citizens of the Tomb,\" \"Companies in Death,\" passed in their turn,\\r\\nlooking like a horde of bandits.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir chiefs--formerly drapers or corn-dealers, retired soap-boilers or\\r\\nsuet-refiners, warriors of circumstance created officers for their money\\r\\nor the length of their moustaches, heaped with arms, flannels, and gold\\r\\nlace--talked loudly, discussed plans of campaign, and gave you to\\r\\nunderstand that they were the sole support of France in her death-agony;\\r\\nbut they were generally in terror of their own soldiers, men \"of the\\r\\nsack and cord,\" most of them brave to foolhardiness, all of them given\\r\\nto pillage and debauchery.\\r\\n\\r\\nReport said that the Prussians were about to enter Rouen. The National\\r\\nGuard, which for two months past had made the most careful\\r\\nreconnoiterings in the neighboring wood, even to the extent of\\r\\noccasionally shooting their own sentries and putting themselves in\\r\\nbattle array if a rabbit stirred in the brushwood, had now retired to\\r\\ntheir domestic hearths; their arms, their uniforms, all the murderous\\r\\napparatus with which they had been wont to strike terror to the hearts\\r\\nof all beholders for three leagues round, had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the last of the French soldiery crossed the Seine on their way\\r\\nto Pont-Audemer by Saint Sever and Bourg-Achard; and then, last of all,\\r\\ncame their despairing general tramping on foot between two orderlies,\\r\\npowerless to attempt any action with these disjointed fragments of his\\r\\nforces, himself utterly dazed and bewildered by the downfall of a people\\r\\naccustomed to victory and now so disastrously beaten in spite of its\\r\\ntraditional bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that a profound calm, the silence of terrified suspense, fell over\\r\\nthe city. Many a rotund bourgeois, emasculated by a purely commercial\\r\\nlife, awaited the arrival of the victors with anxiety, trembling lest\\r\\ntheir meat-skewers and kitchen carving-knives should come under the\\r\\ncategory of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife seemed to have come to a standstill, the shops were closed, the\\r\\nstreets silent. From time to time an inhabitant, intimidated by their\\r\\nsilence, would flit rapidly along the pavement, keeping close to the\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this anguish of suspense, men longed for the coming of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter part of the day following the departure of the French\\r\\ntroops, some Uhlans, appearing from goodness knows where, traversed the\\r\\ncity hastily. A little later, a black mass descended from the direction\\r\\nof Sainte-Catherine, while two more invading torrents poured in from the\\r\\nroads from Darnetal and Bois-guillaume. The advance guards of the three\\r\\ncorps converged at the same moment into the square of the Hotel de\\r\\nVille, while battalion after battalion of the German army wound in\\r\\nthrough the adjacent streets, making the pavement ring under their heavy\\r\\nrhythmic tramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders shouted in strange and guttural tones were echoed back by the\\r\\napparently dead and deserted houses, while from behind the closed\\r\\nshutters eyes peered furtively at the conquerors, masters by right of\\r\\nmight, of the city and the lives and fortunes of its inhabitants. The\\r\\npeople in their darkened dwellings fell a prey to the helpless\\r\\nbewilderment which comes over men before the floods, the devastating\\r\\nupheavals of the earth, against which all wisdom and all force are\\r\\nunavailing. The same phenomenon occurs each time that the established\\r\\norder of things is overthrown, when public security is at an end, and\\r\\nwhen all that the laws of man or of nature protect is at the mercy of\\r\\nsome blind elemental force. The earthquake burying an entire population\\r\\nunder its falling houses; the flood that carries away the drowned body\\r\\nof the peasant with the carcasses of his cattle and the beams torn from\\r\\nhis roof-tree; or the victorious army massacring those who defend their\\r\\nlives, and making prisoners of the rest--pillaging in the name of the\\r\\nsword, and thanking God to the roar of cannon--are so many appalling\\r\\nscourges which overthrow all faith in eternal justice, all the\\r\\nconfidence we are taught to place in the protection of Providence and\\r\\nthe reason of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall detachments now began knocking at the doors and then disappearing\\r\\ninto the houses. It was the occupation after the invasion. It now\\r\\nbehooved the vanquished to make themselves agreeable to the victors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, the first alarms having subsided, a new sense of\\r\\ntranquillity began to establish itself. In many families the Prussian\\r\\nofficer shared the family meals. Not infrequently he was a gentleman,\\r\\nand out of politeness expressed his commiseration with France and his\\r\\nrepugnance at having to take part in such a war. They were grateful\\r\\nenough to him for this sentiment--besides, who knew when they might not\\r\\nbe glad of his protection? By gaining his good offices one might have\\r\\nfewer men to feed. And why offend a person on whom one was utterly\\r\\ndependent? That would not be bravery but temerity, a quality of which\\r\\nthe citizens of Rouen could no longer be accused as in the days of those\\r\\nheroic defenses by which the city had made itself famous. Above all,\\r\\nthey said, with the unassailable urbanity of the Frenchman, it was\\r\\nsurely permissible to be on politely familiar terms in private, provided\\r\\none held aloof from the foreign soldier in public. In the street,\\r\\ntherefore, they ignored one another\\'s existence, but once indoors they\\r\\nwere perfectly ready to be friendly, and each evening found the German\\r\\nstaying longer at the family fireside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town itself gradually regained its wonted aspect. The French\\r\\ninhabitants did not come out much, but the Prussian soldiers swarmed in\\r\\nthe streets. For the rest, the blue hussar officers who trailed their\\r\\nmighty implements of death so arrogantly over the pavement did not\\r\\nappear to entertain a vastly deeper grade of contempt for the simple\\r\\ntownsfolk than did the officers of the Chasseurs who had drunk in the\\r\\nsame cafés the year before. Nevertheless there was a something in the\\r\\nair; something subtle and indefinable, an intolerably unfamiliar\\r\\natmosphere like a widely diffused odor--the odor of invasion. It filled\\r\\nthe private dwellings and the public places, it affected the taste of\\r\\nfood, and gave one the impression of being on a journey, far away from\\r\\nhome, among barbarous and dangerous tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conquerors demanded money--a great deal of money. The inhabitants\\r\\npaid and went on paying; for the matter of that, they were rich. But the\\r\\nwealthier a Normandy tradesman becomes, the more keenly he suffers at\\r\\neach sacrifice each time he sees the smallest particle of his fortune\\r\\npass into the hands of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo or three leagues beyond the town, however, following the course of\\r\\nthe river about Croisset Dieppedalle or Biessard, the sailors and the\\r\\nfishermen would often drag up the swollen corpse of some uniformed\\r\\nGerman, killed by a knife-thrust or a kick, his head smashed in by a\\r\\nstone, or thrown into the water from some bridge. The slime of the river\\r\\nbed swallowed up many a deed of vengeance, obscure, savage, and\\r\\nlegitimate; unknown acts of heroism, silent onslaughts more perilous to\\r\\nthe doer than battles in the light of day and without the trumpet\\r\\nblasts of glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor hatred of the Alien is always strong enough to arm some intrepid\\r\\nbeings who are ready to die for an Idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, seeing that though the invaders had subjected the city to their\\r\\ninflexible discipline they had not committed any of the horrors with\\r\\nwhich rumor had accredited them throughout the length of their triumphal\\r\\nprogress, the worthy tradespeople took heart of grace and the commercial\\r\\nspirit began once more to stir within them. Some of them who had grave\\r\\ninterests at stake at Havre, then occupied by the French army, purposed\\r\\ntrying to reach that port by going overland to Dieppe and there taking\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took advantage of the influence of German officers whose\\r\\nacquaintance they had made, and a passport was obtained from the general\\r\\nin command.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving therefore engaged a large diligence with four horses for the\\r\\njourney, and ten persons having entered their names at the livery stable\\r\\noffice, they resolved to start on the Tuesday morning before daybreak,\\r\\nto avoid all public remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some days already the ground had been hard with frost, and on the\\r\\nMonday, about three o\\'clock in the afternoon, thick dark clouds coming\\r\\nup from the north brought the snow, which fell without intermission all\\r\\nthe evening and during the whole night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half past four the travelers were assembled in the courtyard of the\\r\\nHotel de Normandie, from whence they were to start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all still half asleep, their teeth chattering with cold in\\r\\nspite of their thick wraps. It was difficult to distinguish one from\\r\\nanother in the darkness, their heaped-up winter clothing making them\\r\\nlook like fat priests in long cassocks. Two of the men, however,\\r\\nrecognized each other; they were joined by a third, and they began to\\r\\ntalk. \"I am taking my wife with me,\" said one. \"So am I.\" \"And I too.\"\\r\\nThe first one added: \"We shall not return to Rouen, and if the Prussians\\r\\ncome to Havre we shall slip over to England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all like-minded and all had the same project.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile there was no sign of the horses being put in. A small lantern\\r\\ncarried by a hostler appeared from time to time out of one dark doorway\\r\\nonly to vanish instantly into another. There was a stamping of horses\\'\\r\\nhoofs deadened by the straw of the litter, and the voice of a man\\r\\nspeaking to the animals and cursing sounded from the depths of the\\r\\nstables. A faint sound of bells gave evidence of harnessing, and became\\r\\npresently a clear and continuous jingle timed by the movement of the\\r\\nbeast, now stopping, now going on again with a brisk shake, and\\r\\naccompanied by the dull tramp of hob-nailed sabots.\\r\\n\\r\\nA door closed sharply. All sound ceased. The frozen travelers were\\r\\nsilent, standing stiff and motionless. A veil of white snow-flakes\\r\\nglistened incessantly as it fell to the ground, blotting out the shape\\r\\nof things, powdering everything with an icy froth; and in the utter\\r\\nstillness of the town, quiet and buried under its winter pall, nothing\\r\\nwas audible but this faint, fluttering, and indefinable rustle of\\r\\nfalling snow--more a sensation than a sound--the intermingling of\\r\\nethereal atoms seeming to fill space, to cover the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man reappeared with his lantern, dragging after him by a rope a\\r\\ndejected and unwilling horse. He pushed it against the pole, fixed the\\r\\ntraces, and was occupied for a long time in buckling the harness, having\\r\\nonly the use of one hand as he carried the lantern in the other. As he\\r\\nturned away to fetch the other horse he caught sight of the motionless\\r\\ngroup of travelers, by this time white with snow. \"Why don\\'t you get\\r\\ninside the carriage?\" he said, \"you would at least be under cover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had never occurred to them, and they made a rush for it. The three\\r\\nmen packed their wives into the upper end and then got in themselves,\\r\\nafter which other distinct and veiled forms took the remaining seats\\r\\nwithout exchanging a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor of the vehicle was covered with straw into which the feet\\r\\nsank. The ladies at the end, who had brought little copper charcoal\\r\\nfoot-warmers, proceeded to light them, and for some time discussed their\\r\\nmerits in subdued tones, repeating to one another things which they had\\r\\nknown all their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the diligence having been furnished with six horses instead of\\r\\nfour on account of the difficulties of the road, a voice outside asked,\\r\\n\"Is everybody here?\" A voice from within answered \"Yes,\" and they\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conveyance advanced slowly--slowly--the wheels sinking in the snow;\\r\\nthe whole vehicle groaned and creaked, the horses slipped, wheezed, and\\r\\nsmoked, and the driver\\'s gigantic whip cracked incessantly, flying from\\r\\nside to side, twining and untwining like a slender snake, and cutting\\r\\nsharply across one or other of the six humping backs, which would\\r\\nthereupon straighten up with a more violent effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperceptibly the day grew. The airy flakes which a traveler--a\\r\\nRouennais \"pur sang\"--once likened to a shower of cotton, had ceased to\\r\\nfall; a dirty gray light filtered through the heavy thick clouds which\\r\\nserved to heighten the dazzling whiteness of the landscape, where now a\\r\\nlong line of trees crusted with icicles would appear, now a cottage with\\r\\na hood of snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of this melancholy dawn the occupants of the diligence\\r\\nbegan to examine one another curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight at the end, in the best seats, opposite to one another, dozed\\r\\nMadame and Monsieur Loiseau, whole-sale wine merchant of the Rue Grand\\r\\nPont.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former salesman of a master who had become bankrupt, Loiseau had\\r\\nbought up the stock and made his fortune. He sold very bad wine at very\\r\\nlow prices to the small country retail dealers, and enjoyed the\\r\\nreputation among his friends and acquaintances of being an unmitigated\\r\\nrogue, a thorough Norman full of trickery and jovial humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis character for knavery was so well established that one evening at\\r\\nthe Prefecture, Monsieur Tournel, a man of keen and trenchant wit,\\r\\nauthor of certain fables and songs--a local glory--seeing the ladies\\r\\ngrowing drowsy, proposed a game of \"L\\'oiseau vole.\"[1] The pun itself\\r\\nflew through the prefect\\'s reception rooms and afterwards through the\\r\\ntown, and for a whole month called up a grin on every face in the\\r\\nprovince.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau was himself a noted wag and famous for his jokes both good and\\r\\nbad, and nobody ever mentioned him without adding immediately, \"That\\r\\nLoiseau is simply priceless!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was of medium height with a balloon-like stomach and a rubicund face\\r\\nframed in grizzled whiskers. His wife--tall, strong, resolute, loud in\\r\\nvoice and rapid of decision--represented order and arithmetic in the\\r\\nbusiness, which he enlivened by his jollity and bustling activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside them, in a more dignified attitude as befitted his superior\\r\\nstation, sat Monsieur Carré-Lamadon, a man of weight; an authority on\\r\\ncotton, proprietor of three branch businesses, officer of the Legion of\\r\\nHonor and member of the General Council. All the time of the Empire he\\r\\nhad remained leader of a friendly opposition, for the sole purpose of\\r\\nmaking a better thing out of it when he came round to the cause which he\\r\\nhad fought with polite weapons, to use his own expression. Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon, who was much younger than her husband, was the\\r\\nconsolation of all officers of good family who might be quartered at the\\r\\nRouen garrison. She sat there opposite to her husband, very small, very\\r\\ndainty, very pretty, wrapped in her furs, and regarding the lamentable\\r\\ninterior of the vehicle with despairing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir neighbors, the Count and Countess Hubert de Breville, bore one of\\r\\nthe most ancient and noble names in Normandy. The Count, an elderly\\r\\ngentleman of dignified appearance, did all in his power to accentuate by\\r\\nevery artifice of the toilet his natural resemblance to Henri Quatre,\\r\\nwho, according to a legend of the utmost glory to the family, had\\r\\nhonored with his royal embraces a Dame de Breville, whose husband had,\\r\\nin consequence, been made Count and Governor of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nA colleague of Monsieur Carré-Lamadon in the General Council, Count\\r\\nHubert represented the Orleanist faction in the department. The history\\r\\nof his marriage with the daughter of a small tradesman of Nantes had\\r\\nalways remained a mystery. But as the Countess had an air of grandeur,\\r\\nunderstood better than any one else the art of receiving, passed even\\r\\nfor having been beloved by one of the sons of Louis Philippe, the\\r\\nneighboring nobility bowed down to her, and her salon held the first\\r\\nplace in the county, the only one which preserved the traditions of the\\r\\nviel le galanterie and to which the entreé was difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fortune of the Brevilles--all in Government Funds--was reported to\\r\\nyield them an income of five hundred thousand francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six passengers occupied the upper end of the conveyance, the\\r\\nrepresentatives of revenued society, serene in the consciousness of its\\r\\nstrength--honest well-to-do people possessed of Religion and Principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some strange chance all the women were seated on the same side, the\\r\\nCountess having two sisters of Mercy for neighbors, wholly occupied in\\r\\nfingering their long rosaries and mumbling Paters and Aves. One of them\\r\\nwas old and so deeply pitted with the small-pox that she looked as if\\r\\nshe had received a charge of grape shot full in the face; the other was\\r\\nvery shadowy and frail, with a pretty unhealthy little face, a narrow\\r\\nphthisical chest, consumed by that devouring faith which creates martyrs\\r\\nand ecstatics.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated opposite to the two nuns were a man and woman who excited a good\\r\\ndeal of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, who was well known, was Cornudet, \"the demon,\" the terror of\\r\\nall respectable, law-abiding people. For twenty years he had dipped his\\r\\ngreat red beard into the beer mugs of all the democratic café\\'s. In the\\r\\ncompany of kindred spirits he had managed to run through a comfortable\\r\\nlittle fortune inherited from his father, a confectioner, and he looked\\r\\nforward with impatience to the Republic, when he should obtain the\\r\\nwell-merited reward for so many revolutionary draughts. On the Fourth of\\r\\nSeptember--probably through some practical joke--he understood that he\\r\\nhad been appointed prefect, but on attempting to enter upon his duties\\r\\nthe clerks, who had remained sole masters of the offices, refused to\\r\\nrecognize him, and he was constrained to retire. For the rest, he was a\\r\\ngood fellow, inoffensive and serviceable, and had busied himself with\\r\\nincomparable industry in organizing the defense of the town; had had\\r\\nholes dug all over the plain, cut down all the young trees in the\\r\\nneighboring woods, scattered pitfalls up and down all the high roads,\\r\\nand at the threatened approach of the enemy--satisfied with his\\r\\npreparations--had fallen back with all haste on the town. He now\\r\\nconsidered that he would be more useful in Havre, where fresh\\r\\nentrenchments would soon become necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, one of the so-called \"gay\" sisterhood, was noted for her\\r\\nprecocious stoutness, which had gained her the nickname of \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\"--\"ball of fat.\" She was a little roly-poly creature, cushioned\\r\\nwith fat, with podgy fingers squeezed in at the joints like rows of\\r\\nthick, short sausages; her skin tightly stretched and shiny, her bust\\r\\nenormous, and yet with it all so wholesomely, temptingly fresh and\\r\\nappetizing that it was a pleasure to look at her. Her face was like a\\r\\nruddy apple--a peony rose just burst into bloom--and out of it gazed a\\r\\npair of magnificent dark eyes overshadowed by long thick lashes that\\r\\ndeepened their blackness; and lower down, a charming little mouth, dewy\\r\\nto the kiss, and furnished with a row of tiny milk-white teeth. Over and\\r\\nabove all this she was, they said, full of inestimable qualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was her identity recognized than a whisper ran through the\\r\\nladies in which the words \"prostitute\" and \"public scandal,\" were so\\r\\nconspicuously distinct that she raised her head and retaliated by\\r\\nsweeping her companions with such a bold and defiant look that deep\\r\\nsilence instantly fell upon them, and they all cast down their eyes with\\r\\nthe exception of Loiseau, who watched her with a kindling eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, conversation was soon resumed between the three ladies, whom\\r\\nthe presence of this \"person\" had suddenly rendered friendly--almost\\r\\nintimate. It seemed to them that they must, as it were, raise a rampart\\r\\nof their dignity as spouses between them and this shameless creature who\\r\\nmade a traffic of herself; for legalized love always takes a high hand\\r\\nwith her unlicensed sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men too, drawn to one another by a conservative instinct at\\r\\nsight of Cornudet, talked money in a certain tone of contempt for the\\r\\nimpecunious. Count Hubert spoke of the damage inflicted on him by the\\r\\nPrussians, of the losses which would result to him from the seizing of\\r\\ncattle and from ruined crops, but with all the assurance of a great\\r\\nlanded proprietor, ten times millionaire, whom these ravages might\\r\\ninconvenience for the space of a year at most. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon,\\r\\nof great experience in the cotton industry, had taken the precaution to\\r\\nsend six hundred thousand francs across to England as provision against\\r\\na rainy day. As for Loiseau, he made arrangements to sell all the wine\\r\\nin his cellars to the French commission of supplies, consequently the\\r\\nGovernment owed him a formidable sum, which he counted upon receiving at\\r\\nHavre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three exchanged rapid and amicable glances. Although differing in\\r\\nposition they felt themselves brothers in money, and of the great\\r\\nfreemasonry of those who possess, of those who can make the gold jingle\\r\\nwhen they put their hands in the breeches-pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diligence went so slowly that by ten o\\'clock in the morning they had\\r\\nnot made four leagues. The men got out three times and climbed the hill\\r\\non foot. They began to grow anxious, for they were to have lunched at\\r\\nTotes, and now they despaired of reaching that place before night.\\r\\nEverybody was on the look-out for some inn by the way, when the vehicle\\r\\nstuck fast in a snowdrift, and it took two hours to get it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the pangs of hunger began to affect them severely both in mind\\r\\nand body, and yet not an inn, not a tavern even, was to be seen; the\\r\\napproach of the Prussians and the passage of the famished French troops\\r\\nhad frightened away all trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen foraged diligently for the provisions in the farms by the\\r\\nroadside; but they failed to obtain so much as a piece of bread, for the\\r\\nmistrustful peasant hid all reserve stores for fear of being pillaged by\\r\\nthe soldiers, who, having no food supplied to them, took by force\\r\\neverything they could lay their hands on.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards one o\\'clock Loiseau announced that he felt a very decided void\\r\\nin his stomach. Everybody had been suffering in the same manner for a\\r\\nlong time, and the violent longing for food had extinguished\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time to time some one would yawn, to be almost immediately imitated\\r\\nby another and then each of the rest in turn, and according to their\\r\\ndisposition, manners, or social standing, would open their mouth\\r\\nnoisily, or modestly cover with the hand the gaping cavity from which\\r\\nthe breath issued in a vapor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif had several times stooped down as if feeling for something\\r\\nunder her skirts. She hesitated a moment, looked at her companions, and\\r\\nthen composedly resumed her former position. The faces were pale and\\r\\ndrawn. Loiseau declared he would give a thousand francs for a ham. His\\r\\nwife made a faint movement as to protest, but restrained herself. It\\r\\nalways affected her painfully to hear of money being thrown away, nor\\r\\ncould she even understand a joke upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To tell the truth,\" said the Count, \"I do not feel quite myself\\r\\neither--how could I have omitted to think of bringing provisions?\" And\\r\\neverybody reproached themselves with the same neglectfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, however, had a flask of rum which he offered round. It was\\r\\ncoldly refused. Loiseau alone accepted a mouthful, and handed back the\\r\\nflask with thanks saying, \"That\\'s good! that warms you up and keeps the\\r\\nhunger off a bit.\" The alcohol raised his spirits somewhat, and he\\r\\nproposed that they should do the same as on the little ship in the\\r\\nsong--eat the fattest of the passengers. This indirect but obvious\\r\\nallusion to Boule De Suif shocked the gentle people. Nobody responded\\r\\nand only Cornudet smiled. The two Sisters of Mercy had ceased to tell\\r\\ntheir beads and sat motionless, their hands buried in their wide\\r\\nsleeves, their eyes obstinately lowered, doubtless engaged in offering\\r\\nback to Heaven the sacrifice of suffering which it sent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, at three o\\'clock, when they were in the middle of an\\r\\ninterminable stretch of bare country without a single village in sight,\\r\\nBoule de Suif, stooping hurriedly, drew from under the seat a large\\r\\nbasket covered with a white napkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of it she took, first of all, a little china plate and a delicate\\r\\nsilver drinking-cup, and then an immense dish, in which two whole fowls\\r\\nready carved lay stiffened in their jelly. Other good things were\\r\\nvisible in the basket: patties, fruits, pastry--in fact provisions for a\\r\\nthree days\\' journey in order to be independent of inn cookery. The necks\\r\\nof four bottles protruded from between the parcels of food. She took the\\r\\nwing of a fowl and began to eat it daintily with one of those little\\r\\nrolls which they call \"Regence\" in Normandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery eye was fixed upon her. As the odor of the food spread through the\\r\\ncarriage nostrils began to quiver and mouths to fill with water, while\\r\\nthe jaws, just below the ears contracted painfully. The dislike\\r\\nentertained by the ladies for this abandoned young woman grew savage,\\r\\nalmost to the point of longing to murder her or at least to turn her out\\r\\ninto the snow, her and her drinking-cup and her basket and her\\r\\nprovisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, was devouring the dish of chicken with his eyes.\\r\\n\"Madame has been more prudent than we,\" he said. \"Some people always\\r\\nthink of everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head in his direction. \"If you would care for any,\\r\\nMonsieur--? It is not comfortable to fast for so long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed. \"Ma foi!--frankly, I won\\'t refuse. I can\\'t stand this any\\r\\nlonger--the fortune of war, is it not, madame?\" And with a comprehensive\\r\\nlook he added: \"In moments such as this we are only too glad to find any\\r\\none who will oblige us.\" He had a newspaper which he spread on his knee\\r\\nto save his trousers, and with the point of a knife which he always\\r\\ncarried in his pocket he captured a drumstick all glazed with jelly,\\r\\ntore it with his teeth, and then proceeded to chew it with satisfaction\\r\\nso evident that a deep groan of distress went up from the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this Boule de Suif in a gentle and humble tone invited the two\\r\\nSisters to share the collation. They both accepted on the spot, and\\r\\nwithout raising their eyes began to eat very hurriedly, after stammering\\r\\na few words of thanks. Nor did Cornudet refuse his neighbor\\'s offer, and\\r\\nwith the Sisters they formed a kind of table by spreading out newspapers\\r\\non their knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jaws opened and shut without a pause, biting, chewing, gulping\\r\\nferociously. Loiseau, hard at work in his corner, urged his wife in a\\r\\nlow voice to follow his example. She resisted for some time, then, after\\r\\na pang which gripped her very vitals, she gave in. Whereupon her\\r\\nhusband, rounding off his phrases, asked if their \"charming\\r\\nfellow-traveler\" would permit him to offer a little something to Madame\\r\\nLoiseau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes, certainly, Monsieur,\" she answered with a pleasant smile, and\\r\\nhanded him the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment of embarrassment when the first bottle of claret was\\r\\nuncorked--there was but the one drinking-cup. Each one wiped it before\\r\\npassing it to the rest. Cornudet alone, from an impulse of gallantry no\\r\\ndoubt, placed his lips on the spot still wet from the lips of his\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was that, surrounded by people who were eating, suffocated by\\r\\nthe fragrant odor of the viands, the Count and Countess de Breville and\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Carré-Lamadon suffered the agonies of that torture\\r\\nwhich has ever been associated with the name of Tantalus. Suddenly the\\r\\nyoung wife of the cotton manufacturer gave a deep sigh. Every head\\r\\nturned towards her; she was as white as the snow outside, her eyes\\r\\nclosed, her head fell forward--she had fainted. Her husband, distraught\\r\\nwith fear, implored assistance of the whole company. All lost their\\r\\nheads till the elder of the two Sisters, who supported the unconscious\\r\\nlady, forced Boule de Suif\\'s drinking-cup between her lips and made her\\r\\nswallow a few drops of wine. The pretty creature stirred, opened her\\r\\neyes, smiled and then declared in an expiring voice that she felt quite\\r\\nwell now. But to prevent her being overcome again in the same manner,\\r\\nthe Sister induced her to drink a full cup of wine, adding, \"It is\\r\\nsimply hunger--nothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Boule de Suif, blushing violently, looked at the four starving\\r\\npassengers and faltered shyly, \"Mon Dieu! If I might make so bold as to\\r\\noffer the ladies and gentlemen--\" She stopped short, fearing a rude\\r\\nrebuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, at once threw himself into the breach. \"Parbleu! under\\r\\nsuch circumstances we are all companions in misfortune and bound to help\\r\\neach other. Come, ladies, don\\'t stand on ceremony--take what you can get\\r\\nand be thankful: who knows whether we shall be able to find so much as\\r\\na house where we can spend the night? At this rate we shall not reach\\r\\nTotes till to-morrow afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey still hesitated, nobody having the courage to take upon themselves\\r\\nthe responsibility of the decisive \"Yes.\" Finally the Count seized the\\r\\nbull by the horns. Adopting his most grandiose air, he turned with a bow\\r\\nto the embarrassed young woman and said, \"We accept your offer with\\r\\nthanks, madame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first step only was difficult. The Rubicon once crossed, they fell\\r\\nto with a will. They emptied the basket, which contained, besides the\\r\\nprovisions already mentioned; a pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece\\r\\nof smoked tongue, some pears, a slab of gingerbread, mixed biscuits, and\\r\\na cup of pickled onions and gherkins in vinegar--for, like all women,\\r\\nBoule de Suif adored crudities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not well eat the young woman\\'s provisions and not speak to\\r\\nher, so they conversed--stiffly at first, and then, seeing that she\\r\\nshowed no signs of presuming, with less reserve. Mesdames de Breville\\r\\nand Carré-Lamadon, having a great deal of \"savoir vivre,\" knew how to\\r\\nmake themselves agreeable with tact and delicacy. The Countess, in\\r\\nparticular, exhibited the amiable condescension of the extremely\\r\\nhigh-born lady whom no contact can sully, and was charming. But big\\r\\nMadame Loiseau, who had the soul of a gendarme, remained unmoved,\\r\\nspeaking little and eating much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation naturally turned upon the war. They related horrible\\r\\ndeeds committed by the Prussians and examples of the bravery of the\\r\\nFrench; all these people who were flying rendering full homage to the\\r\\ncourage of those who remained behind. Incidents of personal experience\\r\\nsoon followed, and Boule de Suif told, with that warmth of coloring\\r\\nwhich women of her type often employ in expressing their natural\\r\\nfeelings, how she had come to leave Rouen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought at first I should be able to hold out,\" she said, \"for I had\\r\\nplenty of provisions in my house, and would much rather feed a few\\r\\nsoldiers than turn out of my home and go goodness knows where. But when\\r\\nI saw them--these Prussians--it was too much for me. They made my blood\\r\\nboil with rage, and I cried the whole day for shame. Oh, if I had only\\r\\nbeen a man!--well, there! I watched them from my window--fat pigs that\\r\\nthey were with their spiked helmets--and my servant had to hold my hands\\r\\nto prevent me throwing the furniture down on the top of them. Then some\\r\\nof them came to be quartered on me, and I flew at the throat of the\\r\\nfirst one--they are not harder to strangle than any one else--and would\\r\\nhave finished him too if they had not dragged me off by the hair. Of\\r\\ncourse I had to lie low after that. So as soon as I found an opportunity\\r\\nI left--and here I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody congratulated her. She rose considerably in the estimation of\\r\\nher companions, who had not shown themselves of such valiant mettle, and\\r\\nlistening to her tale, Cornudet smiled the benignant and approving smile\\r\\nof an apostle--as a priest might on hearing a devout person praise the\\r\\nAlmighty; democrats with long beards having the monopoly of patriotism\\r\\nas the men of the cassock possess that of religion. He then took up the\\r\\nparable in a didactic tone with the phraseology culled from the notices\\r\\nposted each day on the walls, and finished up with a flourish of\\r\\neloquence in which he scathingly alluded to \"that blackguard of a\\r\\nBadinguet.\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Boule de Suif fired up at this for she was a Bonapartist. She turned\\r\\nupon him with scarlet cheeks and stammering with indignation, \"Ah! I\\r\\nshould just like to have seen any of you in his place! A nice mess you\\r\\nwould have made of it! It is men of your sort that ruined him, poor man.\\r\\nThere would be nothing for it but to leave France for good if we were\\r\\ngoverned by cowards like you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, nothing daunted, preserved a disdainful and superior smile,\\r\\nbut there was a feeling in the air that high words would soon follow,\\r\\nwhereupon the Count interposed, and managed, not without difficulty, to\\r\\nquiet the infuriated young woman by asserting authoritatively that every\\r\\nsincere opinion was to be respected. Nevertheless the Countess and the\\r\\nmanufacturer\\'s wife, who nourished in their hearts the unreasoning\\r\\nhatred of all well-bred people for the Republic and at the same time\\r\\nthat instinctive weakness of all women for uniformed and despotic\\r\\ngovernments, felt drawn, in spite of themselves, to this woman of the\\r\\nstreet who had so much sense of the fitness of things and whose opinions\\r\\nso closely resembled their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basket was empty--this had not been difficult among ten of\\r\\nthem--they only regretted it was not larger. The conversation was kept\\r\\nup for some little time longer, although somewhat more coldly after they\\r\\nhad finished eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night fell, the darkness grew gradually more profound, and the cold,\\r\\nto which digestion rendered them more sensitive, made even Boule de Suif\\r\\nshiver in spite of her fat. Madame de Breville thereupon offered her\\r\\nher charcoal foot-warmer, which had been replenished several times since\\r\\nthe morning; she accepted with alacrity, for her feet were like ice.\\r\\nMesdames Carré-Lamadon and Loiseau lent theirs to the two Sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver had lit his lanterns, which shed a vivid light over the cloud\\r\\nof vapor that hung over the steaming back of the horses and over the\\r\\nsnow at each side of the road, which seemed to open out under the\\r\\nshifting reflection of the lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the conveyance nothing could be distinguished any longer, but\\r\\nthere was a sudden movement between Boule de Suif and Cornudet, and\\r\\nLoiseau, peering through the gloom, fancied he saw the man with the\\r\\nbeard start back quickly as if he had received a well-directed but\\r\\nnoiseless blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny points of fire appeared upon the road in front. It was Totes. The\\r\\ntravelers had been driving for eleven hours, which, with the four\\r\\nhalf-hours for food and rest to the horses, made thirteen. They entered\\r\\nthe town and stopped in front of the Hotel de la Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened. A familiar sound caused every passenger to tremble--it\\r\\nwas the clink of a scabbard on the stones. At the same moment a German\\r\\nvoice called out something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the diligence had stopped, nobody attempted to get out, as\\r\\nthough they expected to be massacred on setting foot to the ground. The\\r\\ndriver then appeared holding up one of the lanterns, which suddenly\\r\\nillumined the vehicle to its farthest corner and revealed the two rows\\r\\nof bewildered faces with their open mouths and startled eyes wide with\\r\\nalarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside the driver in the full glare of the light stood a German\\r\\nofficer, a tall young man excessively slender and blonde, compressed\\r\\ninto his uniform like a girl in her stays, and wearing, well over one\\r\\near, a flat black wax-cloth cap like the \"Boots\" of an English hotel.\\r\\nHis preposterously long moustache, which was drawn out stiff and\\r\\nstraight, and tapered away indefinitely to each side till it finished\\r\\noff in a single thread so thin that it was impossible to say where it\\r\\nended, seemed to weigh upon the corners of his mouth and form a deep\\r\\nfurrow in either cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Alsatian-French and stern accents he invited the passengers to\\r\\ndescend: \"Vill you get out, chentlemen and laties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters were the first to obey with the docility of holy women\\r\\naccustomed to unfaltering submission. The Count and Countess appeared\\r\\nnext, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, and after them Loiseau\\r\\npushing his better half in front of him. As he set foot to the ground he\\r\\nremarked to the officer, more from motives of prudence than politeness,\\r\\n\"Good evening, Monsieur,\" to which the other with the insolence of the\\r\\nman in possession, vouchsafed no reply but a stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif and Cornudet, though the nearest the door, were the last\\r\\nto emerge--grave and haughty in face of the enemy. The buxom young woman\\r\\nstruggled hard to command herself and be calm; the democrat tugged at\\r\\nhis long rusty beard with a tragic and slightly trembling hand. They\\r\\nsought to preserve their dignity, realizing that in such encounters each\\r\\none, to a certain extent, represents his country; and the two being\\r\\nsimilarly disgusted at the servile readiness of their companions, she\\r\\nendeavored to show herself prouder than her fellow travelers who were\\r\\nhonest women, while he, feeling that he must set an example, continued\\r\\nin his attitude his mission of resistance begun by digging pitfalls in\\r\\nthe high roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all entered the huge kitchen of the inn, and the German, having\\r\\nbeen presented with the passport signed by the general in command--where\\r\\neach traveler\\'s name was accompanied by a personal description and a\\r\\nstatement as to his or her profession--he proceeded to scrutinize the\\r\\nparty for a long time, comparing the persons with the written notices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he exclaimed unceremoniously, \"C\\'est pien--that\\'s all right,\"\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey breathed again more freely. Hunger having reasserted itself, supper\\r\\nwas ordered. It would take half an hour to prepare, so while two\\r\\nservants were apparently busied about it the travelers dispersed to look\\r\\nat their rooms. These were all together down each side of a long passage\\r\\nending in a door with ground glass panels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, just as they were sitting down to table, the innkeeper himself\\r\\nappeared. He was a former horse-dealer, a stout asthmatic man with\\r\\nperpetual wheezings and blowings and rattlings of phlegm in his throat.\\r\\nHis father had transmitted to him the name of Follenvie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif started and turned round. \"That is my name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle, the Prussian officer wants to speak to you at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if you really are Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated, thought for a moment, and then declared roundly: \"That\\r\\nmay be, but I\\'m not going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement round about her--everybody was much exercised as to\\r\\nthe reason of this summons. The Count came over to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may do wrong to refuse, madame, for it may entail considerable\\r\\nannoyance not only to yourself but on the rest of your companions. It is\\r\\na fatal mistake ever to offer resistance to people who are stronger than\\r\\nourselves. The step can have no possible danger for you--it is probably\\r\\nabout some little formality that has been omitted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne and all concurred with him, implored and urged and scolded, till\\r\\nthey ended by convincing her; for they were all apprehensive of the\\r\\nresults of her contumacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I do it for you sure enough!\" she said at last. The Countess\\r\\npressed her hand. \"And we are most grateful to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the room, and the others agreed to wait for her before\\r\\nbeginning the meal. Each one lamented at not having been asked for\\r\\ninstead of this hot-headed, violent young woman, and mentally prepared\\r\\nany number of platitudes for the event of being called in their turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of ten minutes she returned, crimson with rage, choking,\\r\\nsnorting,--\"Oh, the blackguard; the low blackguard!\" she stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all crowded round her to know what had happened, but she would not\\r\\nsay, and the Count becoming insistent, she answered with much dignity,\\r\\n\"No, it does not concern anybody! I can\\'t speak of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then seated themselves round a great soup tureen from which steamed\\r\\na smell of cabbage. In spite of this little contretemps the supper was\\r\\na gay one. The cider, of which the Loiseaus and the two nuns partook\\r\\nfrom motives of economy, was good. The rest ordered wine and Cornudet\\r\\ncalled for beer. He had a particular way with him of uncorking the\\r\\nbottle, of making the liquid froth, of gazing at it while he tilted the\\r\\nglass, which he then held up between his eye and the light to criticise\\r\\nthe color; while he drank, his great beard, which had the tints of his\\r\\nfavorite beverage, seemed to quiver fondly, his eyes squinting that he\\r\\nmight not lose sight of his tankard for a moment, and altogether he had\\r\\nthe appearance of fulfilling the sole function for which he had been\\r\\nborn. You would have said that he established in his own mind some\\r\\nconnection or affinity between the two great passions that monopolized\\r\\nhis life--Ale and Revolution--and most assuredly he never dipped into\\r\\nthe one without thinking of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Follenvie supped at the farther end of the table.\\r\\nThe husband--puffing and blowing like a bursting locomotive--had too\\r\\nmuch cold on the chest to be able to speak and eat at the same time, but\\r\\nhis wife never ceased talking. She described her every impression at the\\r\\narrival of the Prussians and all they did and all they said, execrating\\r\\nthem in the first place because they cost so much, and secondly because\\r\\nshe had two sons in the army. She addressed herself chiefly to the\\r\\nCountess, as it flattered her to be able to say she had conversed with a\\r\\nlady of quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe presently lowered her voice and proceeded to recount some rather\\r\\ndelicate matters, her husband breaking in from time to time with--\"You\\r\\nhad much better hold your tongue, Madame Follenvie,\"--to which she paid\\r\\nnot the slightest attention, but went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, madame, as I was saying--these men, they do nothing but eat\\r\\npotatoes and pork and pork and potatoes from morning till night. And as\\r\\nfor their habits--! And you should see them exercising for hours and\\r\\ndays together out there in the fields--It\\'s forward march and backward\\r\\nmarch, and turn this way and turn that. If they even worked in the\\r\\nfields or mended the roads in their own country! But, no, madame, these\\r\\nsoldiers are no good to anybody, and the poor people have to keep them\\r\\nand feed them simply that they may learn how to massacre. I know I am\\r\\nonly a poor ignorant old woman, but when I see these men wearing\\r\\nthemselves out by tramping up and down from morning till night, I cannot\\r\\nhelp saying to myself, if there are some people who make a lot of useful\\r\\ndiscoveries, why should others give themselves so much trouble to do\\r\\nharm? After all, isn\\'t it an abomination to kill anybody, no matter\\r\\nwhether they are Prussians, or English, or Poles, or French? If you\\r\\nrevenge yourself on some one who has harmed you that is wicked, and you\\r\\nare taken up and punished; but let them shoot down our sons as if they\\r\\nwere game, and it is all right, and they give medals to the man who\\r\\nkills the most. No, no, look you, I shall never be able to see any rhyme\\r\\nor reason in that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"War is barbarous if one attacks an unoffending neighbor--it is a sacred\\r\\nduty if one defends one\\'s country,\" remarked Cornudet in a declamatory\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman nodded assent. \"Yes--defending oneself, of course, that\\r\\nis quite another thing; but wouldn\\'t it be better to kill all these\\r\\nkings who do this for their pleasure?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet\\'s eyes flashed. \"Bravo, citizeness!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon was lost in thought. Although he was an ardent\\r\\nadmirer of famous military men, the sound common sense of this peasant\\r\\nwoman\\'s observations made him reflect upon the wealth which would\\r\\nnecessarily accrue to the country if all these unemployed and\\r\\nconsequently ruinous hands--so much unproductive force--were available\\r\\nfor the great industrial works that would take centuries to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau meanwhile had left his seat and gone over beside the innkeeper,\\r\\nto whom he began talking in a low voice. The fat man laughed, coughed,\\r\\nand spat, his unwieldy stomach shaking with mirth at his neighbor\\'s\\r\\njokes, and he bought six hogsheads of claret from him for the spring\\r\\nwhen the Prussians would have cleared out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper was scarcely over when, dropping with fatigue, everybody went off\\r\\nto bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, who had made certain observations, let his wife go to\\r\\nbed and proceeded to glue first his ear and then his eye to the keyhole,\\r\\nendeavoring to penetrate what he called \"the mysteries of the corridor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about half an hour he heard a rustling, and hurrying to the\\r\\nkeyhole, he perceived Boule de Suif looking ampler than ever in a\\r\\ndressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She had a candle\\r\\nin her hand and was going towards the end of the corridor. Then a door\\r\\nat one side opened cautiously, and when she returned after a few\\r\\nminutes, Cornudet in his shirt sleeves was following her. They were\\r\\ntalking in a low voice and presently stood still; Boule de Suif\\r\\napparently defending the entrance of her room with much energy.\\r\\nUnfortunately Loiseau was unable to hear what they said till, at the\\r\\nlast, as they raised their voices somewhat, he caught a word or two.\\r\\nCornudet was insisting eagerly. \"Look here,\" he said, \"you are really\\r\\nvery ridiculous--what difference can it make to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she with an offended air retorted, \"No!--let me tell you there are\\r\\nmoments when that sort of thing won\\'t do; and besides--here--it would be\\r\\na crying shame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe obviously did not understand. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this she grew angry. \"Why?\" and she raised her voice still more, \"you\\r\\ndon\\'t see why? and there are Prussians in the house--in the next room\\r\\nfor all you know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply. This display of patriotic prudery evidently aroused\\r\\nhis failing dignity, for with a brief salute he made for his own door on\\r\\ntiptoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau deeply thrilled and amused, executed a double shuffle in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, donned his nightcap, and slipped into the blankets\\r\\nwhere the bony figure of his spouse already reposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole house sank to silence. But anon there arose from somewhere--it\\r\\nmight have been the cellar, it might have been the attics--impossible to\\r\\ndetermine the direction--a rumbling--sonorous, even, regular, dull,\\r\\nprolonged roar as of a boiler under high steam pressure: Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been decided that they should start at eight o\\'clock the next\\r\\nmorning, so they were all assembled in the kitchen by that hour; but the\\r\\ndiligence, roofed with snow, stood solitary in the middle of the\\r\\ncourtyard without horses or driver. The latter was sought for in vain\\r\\neither in the stables or the coachhouse. The men of the party then\\r\\nresolved to beat the country round for him, and went out accordingly.\\r\\nThey found themselves in the public square with the church at one end,\\r\\nand low-roofed houses down each side in which they caught sight of\\r\\nPrussian soldiers. The first one they came upon was peeling potatoes;\\r\\nfarther on another was washing out a barber\\'s shop; while a third,\\r\\nbearded to the eyes, was soothing a crying child and rocking it to and\\r\\nfro on his knee to quiet it. The big peasant woman whose men were all\\r\\n\"with the army in the war\" were ordering about their docile conquerors\\r\\nand showing them by signs what work they wanted done--chopping wood,\\r\\ngrinding coffee, fetching water; one of them was even doing the washing\\r\\nfor his hostess, a helpless old crone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count, much astonished, stopped the beadle, who happened to come out\\r\\nof the vestry at that moment, and asked the meaning of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" replied the old church rat, \"these are not at all bad. From what I\\r\\nhear they are not Prussians, either; they come from farther off, but\\r\\nwhere I can\\'t say; and they have all left a wife and children at home. I\\r\\nam very sure the women down there are crying for their men, too, and it\\r\\nwill all make a nice lot of misery for them as well as for us. We are\\r\\nnot so badly off here for the moment, because they do not harm and are\\r\\nworking just as if they were in their own homes. You see, Monsieur, the\\r\\npoor always help one another; it is the great people who make the\\r\\nwars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, indignant at the friendly understanding established between\\r\\nthe victors and the vanquished, retired from the scene, preferring to\\r\\nshut himself up in the inn. Loiseau of course must have his joke. \"They\\r\\nare re-populating,\" he said. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon found a more fitting\\r\\nexpression. \"They are repairing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the driver was nowhere to be found. At last he was unearthed in the\\r\\nvillage café hobnobbing fraternally with the officer\\'s orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not have orders to have the diligence ready by eight o\\'clock?\"\\r\\nthe Count asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, but I got another order later on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not to put the horses in at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who gave you that order?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma foi--the Prussian commandant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know--you had better ask him. I am told not to harness the\\r\\nhorses, and so I don\\'t harness them--there you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he tell you so himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur, the innkeeper brought me the message from him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last night, just as I was going to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men returned much disconcerted. They asked for Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, but were informed by the servant that on account of his\\r\\nasthma he never got up before ten o\\'clock--he had even positively\\r\\nforbidden them to awaken him before then except in case of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they asked to see the officer, but that was absolutely impossible,\\r\\nalthough he lodged at the inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to approach him on non-military\\r\\nmatters. So they had to wait. The women returned to their rooms and\\r\\noccupied themselves as best they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet installed himself in the high chimney-corner of the kitchen,\\r\\nwhere a great fire was burning. He had one of the little coffee-room\\r\\ntables brought to him and a can of beer, and puffed away placidly at his\\r\\npipe, which enjoyed among the democrats almost equal consideration with\\r\\nhimself, as if in serving Cornudet it served the country also. The pipe\\r\\nwas a superb meerschaum, admirably colored, black as the teeth of its\\r\\nowner, but fragrant, curved, shining familiar to his hand, and the\\r\\nnatural complement to his physiognomy. He sat there motionless, his eyes\\r\\nfixed alternately on the flame of the hearth and the foam on the top of\\r\\nhis tankard, and each time after drinking he passed his bony fingers\\r\\nwith a self-satisfied gesture through his long greasy hair, while he\\r\\nwiped the fringe of froth from his moustache.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the pretext of stretching his legs, Loiseau went out and palmed\\r\\noff his wines on the country retail dealers. The Count and the\\r\\nmanufacturer talked politics. They forecast the future of France, the\\r\\none putting his faith in the Orleans, the other in an unknown savior, a\\r\\nhero who would come to the fore when things were at their very worst--a\\r\\nDu Guesclin, a Joan of Arc perhaps, or even another Napoleon I. Ah, if\\r\\nonly the Prince Imperial were not so young! Cornudet listened to them\\r\\nwith the smile of a man who could solve the riddle of Fate if he would.\\r\\nHis pipe perfumed the whole kitchen with its balmy fragrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stroke of ten Monsieur Follenvie made his appearance. They\\r\\ninstantly attacked him with questions, but he had but one answer which\\r\\nhe repeated two or three times without variation. \"The officer said to\\r\\nme, \\'Monsieur Follenvie, you will forbid them to harness the horses for\\r\\nthese travelers to-morrow morning. They are not to leave till I give my\\r\\npermission. You understand?\\' That is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey demanded to see the officer; the Count sent up his card, on which\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon added his name and all his titles. The Prussian\\r\\nsent word that he would admit the two men to his presence after he had\\r\\nlunched, that is to say, about one o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies came down and they all managed to eat a little in spite of\\r\\ntheir anxiety. Boule de Suif looked quite ill and very much agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were just finishing coffee when the orderly arrived to fetch the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau joined them, but when they proposed to bring Cornudet along to\\r\\ngive more solemnity to their proceedings, he declared haughtily that\\r\\nnothing would induce him to enter into any communication whatsoever with\\r\\nthe Germans, and he returned to his chimney-corner and ordered another\\r\\nbottle of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men therefore went upstairs without him, and were shown into\\r\\nthe best room of the inn, where they were received by the officer\\r\\nlolling in an armchair, his heels on the chimney-piece, smoking a long\\r\\nporcelain pipe, and arrayed in a flamboyant dressing-gown, taken, no\\r\\ndoubt, from the abandoned dwelling-house of some bourgeois of inferior\\r\\ntaste. He did not rise, he vouchsafed them no greeting of any\\r\\ndescription, he did not even look at them--a brilliant sample of the\\r\\nvictorious military cad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last after some moments waiting he said: \"Vat do you vant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count acted as spokesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We wish to leave, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking the reason for this refusal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pecause I do not shoose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all due respect, Monsieur, I would draw your attention to the fact\\r\\nthat your general gave us a permit for Dieppe, and I cannot see that we\\r\\nhave done anything to justify your hard measures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not shoose--dat\\'s all--you can co town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was miserable. They could make nothing of this caprice of\\r\\nthe German\\'s, and the most far-fetched ideas tortured their minds. The\\r\\nwhole party remained in the kitchen engaging in endless discussions,\\r\\nimagining the most improbable things. Were they to be kept as\\r\\nhostages?--but if so, to what end?--or taken prisoners--or asked a large\\r\\nransom? This last suggestion threw them into a cold perspiration of\\r\\nfear. The wealthiest were seized with the worst panic and saw themselves\\r\\nforced, if they valued their lives, to empty bags of gold into the\\r\\nrapacious hands of this soldier. They racked their brains for plausible\\r\\nlies to dissemble their riches, to pass themselves off as poor--very\\r\\npoor. Loiseau pulled off his watch-chain and hid it in his pocket. As\\r\\nnight fell their apprehensions increased. The lamp was lighted, and as\\r\\nthere were still two hours till supper Madame Loiseau proposed a game\\r\\nof \"trente et un.\" It would be some little distraction, at any rate. The\\r\\nplan was accepted; even Cornudet, who had put out his pipe from motives\\r\\nof politeness, taking a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count shuffled the cards, dealt, Boule de Suif had \"trente et un\" at\\r\\nthe first deal; and very soon the interest in the game allayed the fears\\r\\nwhich beset their minds. Cornudet, however, observed that the two\\r\\nLoiseaus were in league to cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were sitting down to the evening meal Monsieur appeared and\\r\\nsaid in his husky voice: \"The Prussian officer wishes to know if\\r\\nMademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset has not changed her mind yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif remained standing and turned very pale, then suddenly her\\r\\nface flamed and she fell into such a paroxysm of rage that she could not\\r\\nspeak. At last she burst out: \"You can tell that scoundrel--that low\\r\\nscum of a Prussian--that I won\\'t--and I never will--do you hear?--never!\\r\\nnever! never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fat innkeeper retired. They instantly surrounded Boule de Suif,\\r\\nquestioning, entreating her to disclose the mystery of her visit. At\\r\\nfirst she refused, but presently, carried away by her indignation, she\\r\\ntold them in plain terms what he demanded of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general indignation was so violent that nobody was shocked. Cornudet\\r\\nbrought his beer glass down on the table with such a bang that it broke.\\r\\nThere was a perfect babel of invective against the base wretch, a\\r\\nhurricane of wrath, a union of all for resistance, as if each had been\\r\\nrequired to contribute a portion of the sacrifice demanded of the one.\\r\\nThe Count protested with disgust that these people behaved really as if\\r\\nthey were early barbarians. The women, in particular, accorded her the\\r\\nmost lively and affectionate sympathy. The nuns, who only appeared at\\r\\nmeals, dropped their eyes and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fury of the storm having abated, they sat down to supper, but\\r\\nthere was little conversation and a good deal of thoughtful abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies retired early; the men, while they smoked, got up a game of\\r\\necarté, which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to join, as they intended\\r\\npumping him skillfully as to the means that could be employed for\\r\\novercoming the officer\\'s opposition to their departure. Unfortunately,\\r\\nhe would absorb himself wholly in his cards, and neither listened to\\r\\nwhat they said nor gave any answer to their questions, but repeated\\r\\nincessantly, \"Play, gentlemen, play!\" His attention was so deeply\\r\\nengaged that he forgot to cough, with the result of eliciting organ\\r\\ntones from his chest; his wheezing lungs running through the whole gamut\\r\\nof asthma from notes of the profoundest bass to the shrill, hoarse crow\\r\\nof the young cock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe refused to go to bed when his wife, who was dropping with sleep, came\\r\\nto fetch him. She therefore departed alone, for on her devolved the \"day\\r\\nduty,\" and she always rose with the sun, while her husband took the\\r\\n\"night day,\" and was always ready to sit up all night with friends. He\\r\\nmerely called out, \"Mind you put my chicken broth in front of the fire!\"\\r\\nand returned to his cards. When they were convinced that there was\\r\\nnothing to be got out of him, they declared that it was high time to go\\r\\nto bed, and left him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were up again pretty early the next day, filled with an indefinite\\r\\nhope, a still keener desire to be gone, and a horror of another day to\\r\\nbe got through in this odious tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! the horses were still in the stable and the coachman remained\\r\\ninvisible. For lack of something better to do, they sadly wandered round\\r\\nthe diligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLunch was very depressing, and a certain chilliness had sprung up with\\r\\nregard to Boule de Suif, for the night--which brings counsel--had\\r\\nsomewhat modified the heat of their opinions. They were almost vexed\\r\\nwith the girl now for not having gone to the Prussian secretly, and thus\\r\\nprepared a pleasant surprise for her companions in the morning. What\\r\\ncould be simpler, and, after all, who would have been any the wiser? She\\r\\nmight have saved appearances by telling the officer that she could not\\r\\nbear to see their distress any longer. It could make so very little\\r\\ndifference to her one way or another!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as yet, nobody confessed to these thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, as they were feeling bored to extinction, the Count\\r\\nproposed a walk round the village. Everybody wrapped up carefully and\\r\\nthe little party started, with the exception of Cornudet, who preferred\\r\\nsitting by the fire, and the two Sisters, who passed their days in the\\r\\nchurch or with the curé.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold--grown more intense each day--nipped their noses and ears\\r\\nviciously, and the feet became so painful that every step was anguish;\\r\\nbut when they caught sight of the open stretch of country it appeared to\\r\\nthem so appallingly lugubrious under its illimitable white covering that\\r\\nthey turned back with one accord, their hearts constricted, their\\r\\nspirits below zero. The four ladies walked in front, the three men\\r\\nfollowing a little behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, who thoroughly took in the situation, suddenly broke out, \"How\\r\\nlong was this fool of a girl going to keep them hanging on in this\\r\\nhole?\" The Count, courteous as ever, observed that one could not demand\\r\\nso painful a sacrifice of any woman--the offer must come from her.\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon remarked that if--as there was every reason to\\r\\nbelieve--the French made an offensive counter-march by way of Dieppe,\\r\\nthe collision could only take place at Totes. This reflection greatly\\r\\nalarmed the other two. \"Why not escape on foot?\" suggested Loiseau. The\\r\\nCount shrugged his shoulders. \"How can you think of such a thing in this\\r\\nsnow--and with our wives? Besides which, we should instantly be pursued,\\r\\ncaught in ten minutes, and brought back prisoners at the mercy of these\\r\\nsoldiers.\" This was incontestable--there was nothing more to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies talked dress, but a certain constraint seemed to have risen\\r\\nup between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once, at the end of the street, the officer came in sight, his\\r\\ntall figure, like a wasp in uniform, silhouetted against the dazzling\\r\\nbackground of snow, and walking with his knees well apart, with that\\r\\nmovement peculiar to the military when endeavoring to save their\\r\\ncarefully polished boots from the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn passing the ladies he bowed, but only stared contemptuously at the\\r\\nmen, who, be it said, had the dignity not to lift their hats, though\\r\\nLoiseau made a faint gesture in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif blushed up to her eyes, and the three married women felt\\r\\nit a deep humiliation to have encountered this soldier while they were\\r\\nin the company of the young woman he had treated so cavalierly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation then turned upon him, his general appearance, his face.\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon, who had known a great many officers and was\\r\\ncompetent to judge of them \"en connoisseur,\" considered this one really\\r\\nnot half bad--she even regretted that he was not French, he would have\\r\\nmade such a fascinating hussar, and would certainly have been much run\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce indoors again, they did not know what to do with themselves. Sharp\\r\\nwords were exchanged on the most insignificant pretexts. The silent\\r\\ndinner did not last long, and they shortly afterwards went to bed,\\r\\nhoping to kill time by sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came down next morning with jaded faces and tempers on the thin\\r\\nedge. The women scarcely addressed a word to Boule de Suif.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the church bell began to ring; it was for a christening. Boule\\r\\nde Suif had a child out at nurse with some peasants near Yvetot. She did\\r\\nnot see it once in a year and never gave it a thought, but the idea of\\r\\nthis baby which was going to be baptized filled her heart with sudden\\r\\nand violent tenderness for her own, and nothing would satisfy her but\\r\\nthat she should assist at the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was she gone than they all looked at one another and proceeded\\r\\nto draw up their chairs; for everybody felt that things had come to that\\r\\npoint that something must be decided upon. Loiseau had an inspiration:\\r\\nthat they should propose to the officer to keep Boule de Suif and let\\r\\nthe rest go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie undertook the mission, but returned almost\\r\\nimmediately. The German, who had some knowledge of human nature, had\\r\\nsimply turned him out of the room. He meant to retain the whole party\\r\\nso long as his desire was unsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Madame Loiseau\\'s plebeian tendencies got the better of her. \"But\\r\\nsurely we are not going to sit down calmly here and die of old age! As\\r\\nthat is her trade, I don\\'t see that she has any right to refuse one man\\r\\nmore than another. Why, she took anybody she could get in Rouen, down to\\r\\nthe very cab drivers. Oh, yes, I know it positively from the coachman of\\r\\nthe Prefecture, who bought his wine at our shop. And now, when it lies\\r\\nwith her to get us out of this scrape, she pretends to be\\r\\nparticular--the brazen hussy! For my part, I consider the officer has\\r\\nbehaved very well! He has probably not had a chance for some time, and\\r\\nthere were three here whom, no doubt, he would have preferred; but\\r\\nno--he is content to take the one who is public property. He respects\\r\\nmarried women. Remember, he is master here. He had only to say \\'I will,\\'\\r\\nand he could have taken us by force with his soldiers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little shudder ran through the other two women. Pretty little Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon\\'s eyes shone and she turned rather pale as though she\\r\\nalready felt herself forcibly seized by the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men, who had been arguing the matter in a corner, now joined them.\\r\\nLoiseau, foaming with rage, was for delivering up \"the hussy\" bound hand\\r\\nand foot to the enemy. But the Count, coming of three generations of\\r\\nambassadors, and gifted with the physique of the diplomatist, was on the\\r\\nside of skill as opposed to brute force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She must be persuaded,\" he said. Whereupon they conspired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women drew up closer together, voices were lowered, and the\\r\\ndiscussion became general, each one offering his or her advice. Nothing\\r\\nwas said to shock the proprieties. The ladies, in particular, were most\\r\\nexpert in felicitous turns of phrase, charming subtleties of speech for\\r\\nexpressing the most ticklish things. A foreigner would have understood\\r\\nnothing, the language was so carefully veiled. But as the slight coating\\r\\nof modesty with which every woman of the world is enveloped is hardly\\r\\nmore than skin deep, they expanded under the influence of this equivocal\\r\\nadventure, enjoying themselves wildly at bottom, thoroughly in their\\r\\nelement, dabbling in sensuality with the gusto of an epicurean cook\\r\\npreparing a toothsome delicacy for somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story finally appeared to them so funny that they quite recovered\\r\\ntheir spirits. The Count indulged in some rather risky pleasantries, but\\r\\nso well put that they raised a responsive smile; Loiseau, in his turn,\\r\\nrapped out some decidedly strong jokes which nobody took in bad part,\\r\\nand the brutal proposition expressed by his wife swayed all their minds:\\r\\n\"As that is her trade, why refuse one man more than another?\" Little\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon seemed even to think that in her place she would\\r\\nrefuse this one less readily than another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were long in preparing the blockade, as if against an invested\\r\\nfortress. Each one agreed upon the part they would play, the arguments\\r\\nthey would bring forward, the maneuvers they would execute. They\\r\\narranged the plan of attack, the stratagems to be employed, and the\\r\\nsurprises of the assault for forcing this living citadel to receive the\\r\\nenemy within its gates. Cornudet alone held aloof, completely outside\\r\\nthe affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were so profoundly occupied with the matter in hand that they never\\r\\nheard Boule de Suif enter the room. But the Count breathed a low warning\\r\\n\"Hush!\" and they lifted their heads. She was there. The talking ceased\\r\\nabruptly, and a certain feeling of embarrassment prevented them from\\r\\naddressing her at first, till the Countess, more versed than the others\\r\\nin the duplicities of the drawing-room, asked how she had enjoyed the\\r\\nchristening.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill full of emotion at what she had witnessed, Boule de Suif described\\r\\nevery detail--the people\\'s faces, their attitudes, even the appearance\\r\\nof the church. It was so nice to pray now and then, she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill luncheon, however, the ladies confined themselves merely to being\\r\\nagreeable to her in order to increase her confidence in them and her\\r\\ndocility to their counsels. But once seated at the table, the attack\\r\\nbegan. It first took the form of a desultory conversation on devotion to\\r\\na cause. Examples from ancient history were cited: Judith and\\r\\nHolofernes, and then, without any apparent connection, Lucretia and\\r\\nSextus, Cleopatra admitting to her couch all the hostile generals, and\\r\\nreducing them to the servility of slaves. Then began a fantastic\\r\\nhistory, which had sprung up in the minds of these ignorant\\r\\nmillionaires, in which the women of Rome were seen on their way to\\r\\nCapua, to rock Hannibal to sleep in their arms, and his officers along\\r\\nwith him, and the phalanxes of the mercenaries. The women were mentioned\\r\\nwho had arrested the course of conquerors, made of their bodies a\\r\\nrampart, a means of dominating, a weapon; who had vanquished by their\\r\\nheroic embraces beings hideous or repulsive, and sacrificed their\\r\\nchastity to vengeance or patriotism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this in so discreet and moderate a manner, with now and then a\\r\\nlittle burst of warm enthusiasm, admirably calculated to excite\\r\\nemulation. To hear them you would have finally come to the conclusion\\r\\nthat woman\\'s sole mission here below was to perpetually sacrifice her\\r\\nperson, to abandon herself continually to the caprices of the warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters appeared to be deaf to it all, sunk in profound thought.\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey allowed her all the afternoon for reflection, but instead of\\r\\ncalling her \"Madame,\" as they had done up till now, they addressed her\\r\\nsimply as \"Mademoiselle\"--nobody could have said exactly why--as if to\\r\\nsend her down a step in the esteem she had gained, and force her to feel\\r\\nthe shame of her position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening just as the soup was being brought to the table Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie made his appearance again with the same message as before:\\r\\n\"The Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset if she\\r\\nhad not changed her mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur,\" Boule de Suif replied curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt supper the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three jokes that hung\\r\\nfire; everybody beat their brains for fresh instances to the point; and\\r\\nfound none, when the Countess, possibly without premeditation and only\\r\\nfrom a vague desire to render homage to religion, interrogated the older\\r\\nof the two Sisters on the main incidents in the lives of the saints.\\r\\nNow, several of them had committed acts which would be counted crimes in\\r\\nour eyes, but the Church readily pardons such misdeeds when they are\\r\\naccomplished for the glory of God or the benefit of our neighbors. Then\\r\\nby one of those tacit agreements, those veiled complaisances in which\\r\\nevery one who wears ecclesiastical habit excels, or perhaps simply from\\r\\na happy want of intelligence, a helpful stupidity, the old nun brought\\r\\nformidable support to the conspiracy. They had imagined her timid; she\\r\\nproved herself bold, verbose, violent. She was not troubled by any of\\r\\nthe shilly-shallyings of casuistry, her doctrine was like a bar of iron,\\r\\nher faith never wavered, her conscience knew no scruples. She considered\\r\\nAbraham\\'s sacrifice a very simple affair, for she herself would have\\r\\ninstantly killed father or mother at an order from above, and nothing,\\r\\nshe averred, could displease the Lord if the intention were commendable.\\r\\nThe Countess, taking advantage of the sacred authority of her unexpected\\r\\nally, drew her on to make an edifying paraphrase, as it were, on the\\r\\nwell-known moral maxim: \"The end justifies the means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, Sister,\" she inquired, \"you think God approves of every pathway\\r\\nthat leads to Him, and pardons the deed if the motive be a pure one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who can doubt it, Madame? An action blamable in itself is often\\r\\nrendered meritorious by the impulse which inspires it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she continued in the same strain, unraveling the intricacies of the\\r\\nwill of the Almighty, predicting His decisions, making Him interest\\r\\nHimself in matters which, of a truth, did not concern Him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was skillfully and discreetly wrapped up, but each word of the\\r\\npious woman in the big white cap made a breach in the indignant\\r\\nresistance of the courtesan. The conversation then glancing off\\r\\nslightly, the woman of the pendent rosaries went on to speak of the\\r\\nreligious houses of her Order, of her superior, of herself and her\\r\\nfragile little companion, her dear little Sister St. Nicephora. They\\r\\nhad been sent for to Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers there down\\r\\nwith small-pox. She described the condition of these poor wretches, gave\\r\\ndetails of their disorder; and while they were thus stopped upon the\\r\\nroad by the whim of this Prussian, many French soldiers might die whom\\r\\nperhaps they could have saved. That was her specialty--nursing soldiers.\\r\\nShe had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and relating her\\r\\ncampaigns, she suddenly revealed herself as one of those Sisters of the\\r\\nfife and drum who seem made for following the camp, picking up the\\r\\nwounded in the thick of battle, and better than any officer for quelling\\r\\nwith a word the great hulking undisciplined recruits--a regular Sister\\r\\nRataplan, her ravaged face all riddled with pits, calling up an image of\\r\\nthe devastations of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke after her for fear of spoiling the excellent effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after dinner they hurried to their rooms, not to reappear\\r\\ntill pretty late the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuncheon passed off quietly. They allowed the seed sown yesterday time\\r\\nto grow and bear fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the Countess proposed a walk, whereupon the Count,\\r\\nfollowing the preconcerted arrangement, took Boule de Suif\\'s arm and\\r\\nfell behind with her a little. He adopted that familiar, paternal,\\r\\nsomewhat contemptuous tone which elderly men affect towards such girls,\\r\\ncalling her \"my dear child,\" treating her from the height of his social\\r\\nposition and indisputable respectability.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came to the point without further preamble. \"So you prefer to keep us\\r\\nhere exposed like yourself to all the violence which must inevitably\\r\\nfollow a check to the Prussian arms, rather than consent to accord one\\r\\nof those favors you have so often dispensed in your time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif did not reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then appealed to her kindness of heart, her reason, her sentiment. He\\r\\nknew how to remain \"Monsieur le Comte,\" yet showing himself at the same\\r\\ntime chivalrous, flattering--in a word, altogether amiable. He exalted\\r\\nthe sacrifice she would be making for them, touched upon their\\r\\ngratitude, and with a final flash of roguishness, \"Besides, my dear, he\\r\\nmay think himself lucky--he will not find many such pretty girls as you\\r\\nin his own country!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing and rejoined the rest of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned, she went straight to her room and did not come down\\r\\nagain. The anxiety was terrible. What was she going to do? How\\r\\nunspeakably mortifying if she still persisted in her refusal!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, they waited for her in vain. Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, entering presently, announced that Mademoiselle Rousset was\\r\\nindisposed, and that there was consequently no need to delay supper any\\r\\nlonger. They all pricked up their ears. The Countess approached the\\r\\ninnkeeper with a whispered \"All right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor propriety\\'s sake he said nothing to his companions, but he made them\\r\\na slight sign of the head. A great sigh of relief went up from every\\r\\nheart, every face lit up with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Saperlipopette!\" cried Loiseau, \"I will stand champagne if there is\\r\\nsuch a thing in this establishment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Loiseau suffered a pang of anguish when the innkeeper returned\\r\\nwith four bottles in his hands. Everybody suddenly turned communicative\\r\\nand cheerful, and their hearts overflowed with brotherly love. The Count\\r\\nseemed all at once to become aware that Madame Carré-Lamadon was\\r\\ncharming; the manufacturer paid compliments to the Countess.\\r\\nConversation became lively, sprightly, and full of sparkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the repast the women themselves were indulging in\\r\\ndecidedly risky witticisms. Eyes grew bright, tongues were loosened, a\\r\\ngood deal of wine had been consumed. The Count, who, even in his cups,\\r\\nretained his characteristic air of diplomatic gravity, made some highly\\r\\nspiced comparisons on the subject of the end of the winter season at the\\r\\nPole and the joy of ice-bound mariners at sight of an opening to the\\r\\nsouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, now in full swing, rose, and lifting high his glass of\\r\\nchampagne, \"To our deliverance!\" he cried. Everybody started to their\\r\\nfeet with acclamation. Even the two Sisters of Mercy, yielding to the\\r\\nsolicitations of the ladies, consented to take a sip of the effervescing\\r\\nwine which they had never tasted before. They pronounced it to be very\\r\\nlike lemonade, though, on the whole, more refined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity there is no piano,\" said Loiseau as a crowning point to the\\r\\nsituation, \"we might have finished up with a little hop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet had not uttered a word, nor made a sign of joining in the\\r\\ngeneral hilarity; he was apparently plunged in the gravest abstractions,\\r\\nonly pulling viciously at his great beard from time to time as if to\\r\\ndraw it out longer than before. At last, about midnight, when the\\r\\ncompany was preparing to separate, Loiseau came hiccoughing over to\\r\\nhim, and digging him in the ribs: \"You seem rather down in the mouth\\r\\nthis evening, citizen--haven\\'t said a word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet threw up his head angrily, and sweeping the company with a\\r\\nflashing and terrible look: \"I tell you all that what you have done\\r\\nto-day is an infamy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose, made his way to the door, exclaimed once again, \"An infamy!\"\\r\\nand vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis somewhat dashed their spirits for the moment. Loiseau, nonplussed\\r\\nat first, soon regained his aplomb and burst into a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\"Sour grapes, old man--sour grapes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others not understanding the allusion, he proceeded to relate the\\r\\n\"mysteries of the corridor.\" This was followed by an uproarious revival\\r\\nof gayety. The ladies were in a frenzy of delight, the Count and\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon laughed till they cried. They could not believe\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say he wanted--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you I saw it with my own eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because the Prussian was in the next room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is incredible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As true as I stand here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count nearly choked; the manufacturer held both his sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you can understand that he does not quite see the joke of the thing\\r\\nthis evening--oh, no--not at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they all three went off again, breathless, choking, sick with\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that they parted for the night. But Madame Loiseau remarked to her\\r\\nhusband when they were alone that that little cat of a Carré-Lamadon\\r\\nhad laughed on the wrong side of her mouth all the evening. \"You know\\r\\nhow it is with these women--they dote upon a uniform, and whether it is\\r\\nFrench or Prussian matters precious little to them. But, Lord--it seems\\r\\nto me a poor way of looking at things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently nobody got much sleep that night, for it was long before the\\r\\nlights ceased to shine under the doors. Champagne, they say, often has\\r\\nthat disturbing effect; it makes one restless and wakeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning a brilliant winter sun shone on the dazzling snow. The\\r\\ndiligence was by this time ready and waiting before the door, while a\\r\\nflock of white pigeons, muffled in their thick plumage, strutted\\r\\nsolemnly in and out among the feet of the six horses, seeking what they\\r\\nmight devour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver, enveloped in his sheepskin, sat on the box smoking his pipe,\\r\\nand the radiant travelers were busily laying in provisions for the rest\\r\\nof the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were only waiting now for Boule de Suif. She appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked agitated and downcast as she advanced timidly towards her\\r\\nfellow travelers, who all, with one movement, turned away their heads as\\r\\nif they had not seen her. The Count, with a dignified movement, took his\\r\\nwife by the arm and drew her away from this contaminating contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor thing stopped short, bewildered; then gathering up her courage\\r\\nshe accosted the wife of the manufacturer with a humble \"Good morning,\\r\\nMadame.\" The other merely replied with an impertinent little nod,\\r\\naccompanied by a stare of outraged virtue. Everybody seemed suddenly\\r\\nextremely busy, and they avoided her as if she had brought the plague\\r\\nin her skirts. They then precipitated themselves into the vehicle, where\\r\\nshe arrived the last and by herself, and resumed in silence the seat she\\r\\nhad occupied during the first part of the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey affected not to see her, not to recognize her; only Madame Loiseau,\\r\\nglancing round at her with scorn and indignation, said half audibly to\\r\\nher husband, \"It\\'s a good thing that I am not sitting beside her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy conveyance jolted off, and the journey recommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke for the first little while. Boule de Suif did not venture\\r\\nto raise her eyes. She felt incensed at her companions, and at the same\\r\\ntime deeply humiliated at having yielded to their persuasions, and let\\r\\nherself be sullied by the kisses of this Prussian into whose arms they\\r\\nhad hypocritically thrust her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess was the first to break the uncomfortable silence. Turning\\r\\nto Madame Carré-Lamadon, she said, \"You know Madame d\\'Etrelles, I\\r\\nthink?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; she is a great friend of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming woman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fascinating! So truly refined; very cultivated, too, and an artist to\\r\\nthe tips of her fingers--she sings delightfully, and draws to\\r\\nperfection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manufacturer was talking to the Count, and through the rattle\\r\\nof the crazy windowpanes one caught a word here and there;\\r\\nshares--dividends--premium--settling day--and the like. Loiseau, who had\\r\\nappropriated an old pack of cards from the inn, thick with the grease of\\r\\nthe five years\\' rubbing on dirty tables, started a game of bezique with\\r\\nhis wife. The two Sisters pulled up the long rosaries hanging at their\\r\\nwaists, made the sign of the cross, and suddenly began moving their lips\\r\\nrapidly, faster and faster, hurrying their vague babble as if for a\\r\\nwager; kissing a medal from time to time, crossing themselves again, and\\r\\nthen resuming their rapid and monotonous murmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet sat motionless--thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the three hours\\' steady traveling Loiseau gathered up his\\r\\ncards and remarked facetiously, \"It\\'s turning hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife then produced a parcel, which she untied, and brought out a\\r\\npiece of cold veal. This she cut up into thin, firm slices, and both\\r\\nbegan to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supposing we do the same?\" said the Countess, and proceeded to unpack\\r\\nthe provisions prepared for both couples. In one of those oblong dishes\\r\\nwith a china hare upon the cover to indicate that a roast hare lies\\r\\nbeneath, was a succulent selection of cold viands--brown slices of juicy\\r\\nvenison mingled with other meats. A delicious square of gruyere cheese\\r\\nwrapped in newspaper still bore imprinted on its dewy surface the words\\r\\n\"General News.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters brought out a sausage smelling of garlic, and Cornudet,\\r\\nplunging his hands into the vast pockets of his loose greatcoat, drew up\\r\\nfour hard-boiled eggs from one and a big crust of bread from the other.\\r\\nHe peeled off the shells and threw them into the straw under his feet,\\r\\nand proceeded to bite into the egg, dropping pieces of the yolk into his\\r\\nlong beard, from whence they shone out like stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hurry and confusion of the morning Boule de Suif had omitted to\\r\\ntake thought for the future, and she looked on, furious, choking with\\r\\nmortification, at these people all munching away so placidly. A storm\\r\\nof rage convulsed her, and she opened her mouth to hurl at them the\\r\\ntorrent of abuse that rose to her lips, but she could not speak,\\r\\nsuffocated by her indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody looked at her, nobody thought of her. She felt herself drowning\\r\\nin the flood of contempt shown towards her by these honest scoundrels\\r\\nwho had first sacrificed her and then cast her off like some useless and\\r\\nunclean thing. Then her thoughts reverted to her great basket full of\\r\\ngood things which they had so greedily devoured--the two fowls in their\\r\\nglittering coat of jelly, her patties, her pears, her four bottles of\\r\\nclaret; and her fury suddenly subsided like the breaking of an\\r\\noverstrung chord and she felt that she was on the verge of tears. She\\r\\nmade the most strenuous efforts to overcome it--straightened herself up\\r\\nand choked back her sobs as children do, but the tears would rise. They\\r\\nglittered for a moment on her lashes, and presently two big drops rolled\\r\\nslowly over her cheeks. Others gathered in quick succession like water\\r\\ndripping from a rock and splashed onto the ample curve of her bosom. She\\r\\nsat up very straight, her eyes fixed, her face pale and rigid, hoping\\r\\nthat nobody would notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Countess saw her and nudged her husband. He shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders as much as to say, \"What can you expect? It is not my fault.\"\\r\\nMadame Loiseau gave a silent chuckle of triumph and murmured, \"She is\\r\\ncrying for shame.\" The two Sisters had resumed their devotions after\\r\\ncarefully wrapping up the remnants of their sausages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Cornudet, while digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under\\r\\nthe opposite seat, leaned back, smiled like a man who has just thought\\r\\nof a capital joke, and began to softly whistle the Marseillaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe faces clouded; the popular air seemed unpleasing to his neighbors;\\r\\nthey became nervous--irritable--looking as if they were ready to throw\\r\\nback their heads and howl like dogs at the sound of a barrel organ. He\\r\\nwas perfectly aware of this, but did not stop. From time to time he\\r\\nhummed a few of the words: \"Liberty, cherished liberty, Fight thou on\\r\\nthe side of thy defenders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove at a much quicker pace to-day, the snow being harder; and all\\r\\nthe way to Dieppe, during the long, dull hours of the journey, through\\r\\nall the jolting and rattling of the conveyance, in the falling shades of\\r\\nevening and later in the profound darkness, he continued with unabated\\r\\npersistency his vengeful and monotonous whistling; forcing his wearied\\r\\nand exasperated fellow travelers to follow the song from end to end and\\r\\nto remember every word that corresponded to each note.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Boule de Suif wept on, and at times a sob which she could not\\r\\nrepress broke out between two couplets in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMISS HARRIET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were seven of us in a break, four women and three men, one of\\r\\nwhich latter was on the box seat beside the coachman, and we were\\r\\nfollowing, at a foot pace, the broad highway which serpentines along the\\r\\ncoast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting out from Etretat at break of day, in order to visit the ruins of\\r\\nTancarville, we were still asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the\\r\\nmorning. The women, especially, who were little accustomed to these\\r\\nearly excursions, let their eyelids fall and rise every moment, nodding\\r\\ntheir heads or yawning, quite insensible to the emotion of the breaking\\r\\nof day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was autumn. On both sides of the road, the bare fields stretched out,\\r\\nyellowed by the corn and wheat stubble which covered the soil, like a\\r\\nbeard that had been badly shaved. The spongy earth seemed to smoke. The\\r\\nlarks were singing, high up in the air, while other birds piped in the\\r\\nbushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun rose at length in front of us, a bright red on the plane of the\\r\\nhorizon; and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute\\r\\nto minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself,\\r\\nstretch itself, like a young girl who is leaving her bed, in her white\\r\\nvapor chemise. The Count of Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look! look! a hare!\" and he extended his arm towards the left, pointing\\r\\nto a piece of hedge. The animal threaded its way along, almost concealed\\r\\nby the field, raising only its large ears. Then it swerved across a\\r\\ndeep rut, stopped, pursued again its easy course, changed its direction,\\r\\nstopped anew, disturbed, spying out every danger, undecided as to the\\r\\nroute it should take; when suddenly it began to run with great bounds of\\r\\nthe hind legs, disappearing finally, in a large patch of beet-root. All\\r\\nthe men had woke up to watch the course of the beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené Lemanoir then exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not at all gallant this morning,\" and regarding his neighbor,\\r\\nthe little Baroness of Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he said to\\r\\nher in a subdued voice: \"You are thinking of your husband, Baroness.\\r\\nReassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you have still\\r\\nfour days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded to him with a sleepy smile: \"How rude you are.\" Then,\\r\\nshaking off her torpor, she added: \"Now, let somebody say something that\\r\\nwill make us all laugh. You, Monsieur Chenal, who have the reputation of\\r\\npossessing a larger fortune than the Duke of Richelieu, tell us a love\\r\\nstory in which you have been mixed up, anything you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very\\r\\nstrong, very proud of his physique, and very amiable, took his long\\r\\nwhite beard in his hand and smiled, then, after a few moments\\'\\r\\nreflection, he became suddenly grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale; for I am going to relate to you\\r\\nthe most lamentable love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that\\r\\nnone of my friends have ever passed through a similar experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at the time twenty-five years of age, and I was making daubs along\\r\\nthe coast of Normandy. I call \"making daubs\" that wandering about, with\\r\\na bag on one\\'s back, from mountain to mountain, under the pretext of\\r\\nstudying and of sketching nature. I know nothing more enjoyable than\\r\\nthat happy-go-lucky wandering life, in which one is perfectly free,\\r\\nwithout shackles of any kind, without care, without preoccupation,\\r\\nwithout thinking even of to-morrow. One goes in any direction one\\r\\npleases, without any guide, save his fancy, without any counselor save\\r\\nhis eyes. One pulls up, because a running brook seduces one, because one\\r\\nis attracted, in front of an inn, by the smell of potatoes frying.\\r\\nSometimes it is the perfume of clematis which decides one in his choice,\\r\\nor the naïve glance of the servant at an inn. Do not despise me for my\\r\\naffection for these rustics. These girls have a soul as well as feeling,\\r\\nnot to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips; while their hearty and\\r\\nwilling kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love always has its price,\\r\\ncome whence it may. A heart that beats when you make your appearance, an\\r\\neye that weeps when you go away, are things so rare, so sweet, so\\r\\nprecious, that they must never be despised.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had rendezvoux in ditches in which cattle repose, and in barns\\r\\namong the straw, still steaming from the heat of the day. I have\\r\\nrecollections of canvas being spread on rude and elastic benches, and of\\r\\nhearty and fresh, free kisses, more delicate and unaffectedly sincere\\r\\nthan the subtle attractions of charming and distinguished women.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what one loves most amidst all these varied adventures is the\\r\\ncountry, the woods, the risings of the sun, the twilight, the light of\\r\\nthe moon. These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with nature. One\\r\\nis alone with her in that long and tranquil rendezvous. You go to bed in\\r\\nthe fields, amidst marguerites and wild poppies, and, with eyes wide\\r\\nopen, you watch the going down of the sun, and descry in the distance\\r\\nthe little village, with its pointed clock tower, which sounds the hour\\r\\nof midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out from the foot of\\r\\nan oak, amidst a covering of fragile herbs, upright and redolent of\\r\\nlife. You go down on your knees, bend forward, you drink that cold and\\r\\npellucid water which wets your moustache and nose, you drink it with a\\r\\nphysical pleasure, as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip.\\r\\nSometimes, when you encounter a deep hole, along the course of these\\r\\ntiny brooks, you plunge into it, quite naked, and you feel on your skin,\\r\\nfrom head to foot, like an icy and delicious caress, the lovely and\\r\\ngentle quivering of the current.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are gay on the hills, melancholy on the verge of pools, exalted when\\r\\nthe sun is crowned in an ocean of blood-red shadows, and when it casts\\r\\non the rivers its red reflection. And, at night, under the moon, which\\r\\npasses across the vault of heaven, you think of things, and singular\\r\\nthings, which would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant\\r\\nlight of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, in wandering through the same country where we are this year, I came\\r\\nto the little village of Benouville, on the Falaise, between Yport and\\r\\nEtretat. I came from Fécamp, following the coast, a high coast, and as\\r\\nperpendicular as a wall, with its projecting and rugged rocks falling\\r\\nperpendicularly into the sea. I had walked since the morning on the\\r\\nshaven grass, as smooth and as yielding as a carpet. And singing\\r\\nlustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow and\\r\\nambling flight of a gull, with its short, white wings, sailing in the\\r\\nblue heavens, sometimes on the green sea, at the brown sails of a\\r\\nfishing bark. In short, I had passed a happy day, a day of listlessness\\r\\nand of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was shown a little farm house, where travelers were put up, a kind of\\r\\ninn, kept by a peasant, which stood in the center of a Norman court,\\r\\nwhich was surrounded by a double row of beeches.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuitting the Falaise, I gained the hamlet, which was hemmed in by great\\r\\ntrees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old, wrinkled and austere rustic, who seemed always to\\r\\nsuccumb to the pressure of new customs with a kind of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the month of May: the spreading apple-trees covered the court\\r\\nwith a whirling shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon\\r\\npeople and upon the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Madame Lecacheur, have you a room for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAstonished to find that I knew her name, she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That depends; everything is let; but, all the same, there will be no\\r\\nharm in looking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five minutes we were in perfect accord, and I deposited my bag upon\\r\\nthe bare floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs, a\\r\\ntable, and a wash-stand. The room looked into the large and smoky\\r\\nkitchen, where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm\\r\\nand the farmer, who was a widower.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman fricasseed a\\r\\nchicken for dinner in a large fireplace, in which hung the stew pot,\\r\\nblack with smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have travelers, then, at the present time?\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered, in an offended tone of voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a lady, an English lady, who has attained to years of maturity.\\r\\nShe is going to occupy my other room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of\\r\\ndining out in the court when the weather was fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cover was then placed in front of the door, and I commenced to gnaw\\r\\nwith my teeth the lean members of the Normandy chicken, to drink the\\r\\nclear cider, and to munch the hunk of white bread, which was four days\\r\\nold, though excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, the wooden barrier which gave into the highway, was opened,\\r\\nand a strange person directed her steps towards the house. She was very\\r\\nslender, very tall, enveloped in a Scotch shawl with red borders, and\\r\\none might have believed that she had no arms, if one had not seen a long\\r\\nhand appear just above the haunches, holding a white tourist umbrella.\\r\\nThe face of a mummy, surrounded with sausage rolls of plaited, gray\\r\\nhair, which bounded at every step she took, made me think, I know not\\r\\nwhy, of a sour herring adorned with curling papers. Lowering her eyes,\\r\\nshe passed quickly in front of me, and entered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat singular apparition made me yearn. She undoubtedly was my\\r\\nneighbor, the aged English lady of whom our hostess had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had installed\\r\\nmyself to commence painting, at the end of that beautiful valley, which\\r\\nyou know, and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, in lifting\\r\\nmy eyes suddenly, something singularly attired, standing on the crest of\\r\\nthe declivity; one might indeed say, a pole decked out with flags. It\\r\\nwas she. On seeing me, she suddenly disappeared. I re-entered the house\\r\\nat midday for lunch, and took my seat at the common table, so as to make\\r\\nthe acquaintance of this old original. But she did not respond to my\\r\\npolite advances, was insensible even to my little attentions. I poured\\r\\nwater out for her with great alacrity; I passed her the dishes with\\r\\ngreat eagerness. A slight, almost imperceptible movement of the head,\\r\\nand an English word, murmured so low that I did not understand it, were\\r\\nher only acknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ceased occupying myself with her, although she had disturbed my\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three days, I knew as much about her as did Madame\\r\\nLecacheur herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in which to\\r\\npass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville, some six months\\r\\nbefore, and did not seem disposed to quit it. She never spoke at table,\\r\\nate rapidly, reading all the while a small book, treating of some\\r\\nprotestant propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The curé\\r\\nhimself had received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to\\r\\nwhom she had paid two sous\\' commission. She said sometimes to our\\r\\nhostess, abruptly, without preparing her in the least for the\\r\\ndeclaration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love the Savior more than all; I admire him in all creation; I adore\\r\\nhim in all nature, I carry him always in my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she would immediately present the old woman with one of her\\r\\nbrochures which were destined to convert the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster had declared\\r\\nthat she was an atheist, and that a kind of reprobation weighed down on\\r\\nher. The curé, who had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner, and I\\r\\nbelieve her to be a person of pure morals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, \"Atheist,\" \"Heretic,\" words which no one can precisely\\r\\ndefine, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that\\r\\nthis English woman was rich, and that she had passed her life in\\r\\ntraveling through every country in the world, because her family had\\r\\nthrown her off. Why had her family thrown her off. Because of her\\r\\nnatural impiety?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles, one of\\r\\nthose opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many, one of\\r\\nthose good and insupportable old women who haunt the table d\\'hôtes of\\r\\nevery hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, impoison Switzerland, render the\\r\\ncharming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere\\r\\ntheir fantastic manias, their petrified vestal manners, their\\r\\nindescribable toilettes and a certain odor of India rubber, which makes\\r\\none believe that at night they slip themselves into a case of that\\r\\nmaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I encounter one of these people some fine day in a hotel, I act\\r\\nlike the birds, who see a manakin in a field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis woman, however, appeared so singular that she did not displease me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not rustic,\\r\\nfelt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic extravagances\\r\\nof the old girl. She had found a phrase by which to describe her, a\\r\\nphrase assuredly contemptible, which she had got, I know not whence,\\r\\nupon her lips, invented by I know not what confused and mysterious\\r\\ntravail of soul. She said: \"That woman is a demoniac.\" This phrase,\\r\\nculled by that austere and sentimental creature, seemed to me\\r\\nirresistibly comic. I myself, never called her now anything else, but\\r\\n\"the demoniac,\" exercising a singular pleasure in pronouncing aloud this\\r\\nword on perceiving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would ask Mother Lecacheur: \"Well, what is our demoniac about to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which my rustic friend responded, with an air of having been\\r\\nscandalized:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think, sir, she has picked up a toad which has had its paw\\r\\nbattered, and carried it to her room, and has put it in her wash-stand,\\r\\nand dressed it up like a man. If that is not profanation, I should like\\r\\nto know what is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another occasion, when walking along the Falaise, she had bought a\\r\\nlarge fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the\\r\\nsea again. The sailor, from whom she had bought it, though paid\\r\\nhandsomely, was greatly provoked at this act, more exasperated, indeed,\\r\\nthan if she had put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For a\\r\\nwhole month he could not speak of the circumstance without getting into\\r\\na fury and denouncing it as an outrage. Oh yes! She was indeed a\\r\\ndemoniac, this Miss Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an\\r\\ninspiration of genius in thus christening her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stable-boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in Africa\\r\\nin his youth, entertained other aversions. He said, with a roguish air:\\r\\n\"She is an old hag who has lived her days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the poor woman had but known!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little, kind-hearted Céleste, did not wait upon her willingly, but I\\r\\nwas never able to understand why. Probably, her only reason was that she\\r\\nwas a stranger, of another race, of a different tongue, and of another\\r\\nreligion. She was, in good truth, a demoniac!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and searching\\r\\nfor God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster of\\r\\nbushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed\\r\\naside the branches and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused\\r\\nat having been found thus, fixed on me eyes as terrible as those of a\\r\\nwild cat, surprised in open day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly descry\\r\\nher on the banks of the Falaise like a semaphore signal. She\\r\\npassionately gazed at the vast sea, glittering in the sunlight, and the\\r\\nboundless sky empurpled with fire. Sometimes I would distinguish her at\\r\\nthe bottom of a valley, walking quickly, with an English, elastic step;\\r\\nand I would go towards her, attracted I know not by what, simply to see\\r\\nher illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed\\r\\nto glow with interior and profound happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would often encounter her also in the corner of a field sitting on the\\r\\ngrass, under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little Bible lying\\r\\nopen on her knee, which she looked at meditatively at the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could no longer tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,\\r\\nbeing bound to it by a thousand links of love for its sweeping and soft\\r\\nlandscapes. At this farm I was unknown to the world, far removed from\\r\\neverything, but in close proximity to the soil, the good, healthy,\\r\\nbeautiful and green soil. And, must I avow it; there was something\\r\\nbesides curiosity which retained me at the residence of Mother\\r\\nLecacheur. I wished to become acquainted a little with this strange Miss\\r\\nHarriet, and to know what passed in the solitary souls of those\\r\\nwandering old, English dames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just finished a\\r\\nstudy, which appeared to me to display play brain power; and so it must,\\r\\nas it was sold for ten thousand francs, fifteen years later. It was as\\r\\nsimple, however, as that two and two make four, and had nothing to do\\r\\nwith academic rules. The whole of the right side of my canvas\\r\\nrepresented a rock, an enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown,\\r\\nyellow, and red, across which the sun poured like a stream of oil. The\\r\\nlight, without which one could see the stars concealed in the back\\r\\nground, fell upon the stone, and gilded it as if by fire. That was all.\\r\\nA first stupid attempt at dealing with light, burning rays, the sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea, but a\\r\\njade of a sea, as greenish, milky and thick as the overcast sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I\\r\\ncarried it back to the inn. I had wished that the whole world could have\\r\\nseen it at one and the same moment. I can remember that I showed it to a\\r\\ncow, which was browsing by the wayside, exclaiming at the same time:\\r\\n\"Look at that, my old beauty, you shall not often see its like again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the front of the house, I immediately called out to\\r\\nMother Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ohè! Ohè! my mistress, come here and look at this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rustic advanced and regarded my work with her stupid eyes which\\r\\ndistinguished nothing, and which did not even recognize whether the\\r\\npicture was the representation of an ox or a house.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet returned to the house, and she passed in rear of me just at\\r\\nthe moment when, holding out my canvas at arm\\'s length, I was exhibiting\\r\\nit to the female innkeeper. The demoniac could not help but see it, for\\r\\nI took care to exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape\\r\\nher notice. She stopped abruptly and stood motionless, stupefied. It was\\r\\nher rock which was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her\\r\\ntime undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a British \"Aoh,\" which was at once so accentuated and so\\r\\nflattering, that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my last work, Mademoiselle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe murmured ecstatically, comically and tenderly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Monsieur, you must understand what it is to have a palpitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI colored up, of course, and was more excited by that compliment than if\\r\\nit had come from a queen. I was seduced, conquered, vanquished. I could\\r\\nhave embraced her; upon my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a seat at the table beside her, as I had always done. For the\\r\\nfirst time, she spoke, drawling out in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I love nature so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI offered her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted these\\r\\nwith the vacant smile of a mummy. I then began to converse with her\\r\\nabout the scenery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the meal, we rose from the table together and we walked leisurely\\r\\nacross the court; then, being attracted by the fiery glow which the\\r\\nsetting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the outside gate\\r\\nwhich opened in the direction of the Falaise, and we walked on side by\\r\\nside, as satisfied as any two persons could be, who have just learned to\\r\\nunderstand and penetrate each other\\'s motives and feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a muggy, relaxing evening, one of those enjoyable evenings, which\\r\\nimpart happiness to mind and body alike. All is joy, all is charm. The\\r\\nluscious and balmy air, loaded with the perfumes of herbs, the perfumes\\r\\nof grass-wrack, which caresses the odor of the wild flowers, caresses\\r\\nthe potato with its marine flavor, caresses the soul with a penetrating\\r\\nsweetness. We were going to the brink of the abyss, which overlooked\\r\\nthe vast sea, and which rolled past us at the distance of less than a\\r\\nhundred meters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we drank with open mouth and expanded chest that fresh breath which\\r\\ncame from the ocean and which glided slowly over the skin, salted by its\\r\\nlong contact with the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrapped up in her square shawl, inspired by the balmy air and with teeth\\r\\nfirmly set, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball, as it\\r\\ndescended towards the sea. Soon its rim touched the waters, just in rear\\r\\nof a ship which appeared on the horizon, until, by degrees, it was\\r\\nswallowed up by the ocean. It was seen to plunge, diminish, and finally\\r\\nto disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet contemplated with a passionate regard the last glimmer of\\r\\nthe flaming orb of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe muttered: \"Aoh! I loved ... I loved ...\" I saw a tear start in her\\r\\neye. She continued: \"I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount\\r\\nup into the firmament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on the\\r\\nriver\\'s banks, her face as red as her purple shawl. I should have liked\\r\\nto have sketched her in my album. It would have been an ecstatic\\r\\ncaricature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned my face away from her so as to be able to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then spoke to her of painting, as I would have done to a fellow\\r\\nartist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the\\r\\nprofession. She listened attentively to me, eagerly seeking to define\\r\\nthe sense of the obscure words, so as to penetrate my thoughts. From\\r\\ntime to time, she would exclaim: \"Oh! I understand, I understand. This\\r\\nhas been very interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, on seeing me, she approached me eagerly, holding out her\\r\\nhand; and we became firm friends immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a brave creature who had a kind of elastic soul, which became\\r\\nenthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium, like all women who are\\r\\nspinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be pickled in vinegar\\r\\ninnocence, though her heart still retained something of youth and of\\r\\ngirlish effervescence. She loved both nature and animals with a fervent\\r\\nardor, a love like old wine, fermented through age, with a sensual love\\r\\nthat she had never bestowed on men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is certain, that a bitch in pup, a mare roaming in a meadow\\r\\nwith a foal at its side, a bird\\'s nest full of young ones, squeaking,\\r\\nwith their open mouths and enormous heads, made her quiver with the most\\r\\nviolent emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor solitary beings! Tristias and wanderers from table d\\'hôte to table\\r\\nd\\'hôte, poor beings, ridiculous and lamentable. I love you ever since I\\r\\nbecame acquainted with Miss Harriet!\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me, but\\r\\nshe dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in\\r\\nthe morning with my box on my back, she accompanied me as far as the end\\r\\nof the village, silent, but evidently struggling inwardly to find words\\r\\nwith which to begin a conversation. Then she left me abruptly, and, with\\r\\na jaunty step, walked away quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, however, she plucked up courage:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would like to see how you paint pictures? Will you? I have been very\\r\\ncurious.\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she colored up as though she had given utterance to words extremely\\r\\naudacious.\\r\\n\\r\\nI conducted her to the bottom of the Petit-Val, where I had commenced a\\r\\nlarge picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing near me, following all my gestures with\\r\\nconcentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing, perhaps, that she was\\r\\ndisturbing me she said to me: \"Thank you,\" and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a short time she became more familiar, and accompanied me every\\r\\nday, her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her\\r\\nfolding stool under her arm, and would not consent to my carrying it,\\r\\nand she sat always by my side. She would remain there for hours,\\r\\nimmovable and mute, following with her eye the point of my brush, in its\\r\\nevery movement. When I would obtain, by a large splatch of color spread\\r\\non with a knife, a striking and unexpected effect, she would, in spite\\r\\nof herself, give vent to a half-suppressed \"Ah!\" of astonishment, of\\r\\njoy, of admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an\\r\\nalmost religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of\\r\\nnature\\'s work divine. My studies appeared to her as a kind of pictures\\r\\nof sanctity, and sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of\\r\\nconverting me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! He was a queer good-natured being, this God of hers. He was a sort\\r\\nof village philosopher without any great resources, and without great\\r\\npower; for she always figured him to herself as a being quivering over\\r\\ninjustices committed under his eyes, and as though he was helpless to\\r\\nprevent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be the\\r\\nconfidant of his secrets and of his contrarieties. She said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God wills, or God does not will,\" just like a sergeant announcing to a\\r\\nrecruit: \"The colonel has commanded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of her heart, she deplored my ignorance of the intentions\\r\\nof the Eternal, which she strove, and felt herself compelled to impart\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every day, I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it from\\r\\nthe ground, in my box of colors, in my polished shoes, standing in the\\r\\nmornings in front of my door, those little pious brochures, which she,\\r\\nno doubt, received directly from Paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected cordiality.\\r\\nBut I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her manner; but,\\r\\nfor a while, I paid little attention to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I walked about, whether to the bottom of the valley, or through\\r\\nsome country lanes, I would see her suddenly appear, as though she were\\r\\nreturning from a rapid walk. She would then sit down abruptly, out of\\r\\nbreath, as though she had been running, or overcome by some profound\\r\\nemotion. Her face would be red, that English red which is denied to the\\r\\npeople of all other countries; then, without any reason, she would grow\\r\\npale, become the color of the ground and seem ready to faint away.\\r\\nGradually, however, I would see her regain her ordinary color, whereupon\\r\\nshe would begin to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a sentence,\\r\\nspring up from her seat, and march off so rapidly and so strangely, that\\r\\nit would, sometimes, put me to my wits ends to try and discover whether\\r\\nI had done or said anything to displease or offend her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finally came to the conclusion that this arose from her early habits\\r\\nand training, somewhat modified, no doubt, in honor of me, since the\\r\\nfirst days of our acquaintanceship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the\\r\\nwind-beaten coast, her long curled hair would be shaken out and hanging\\r\\nloose, as though it had broken away from its bearings. It was seldom\\r\\nthat this gave her any concern; looking sometimes as though she had just\\r\\nreturned from dining _sans cèremonie_; her locks having become\\r\\ndishevelled by the breezes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would then go up to her room in order to adjust what I called her\\r\\nglass lamps; and when I would say to her, in the familiar gallantry,\\r\\nwhich, however, always offended her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are as beautiful as a planet to-day, Miss Harriet,\" a little blood\\r\\nwould immediately mount into her cheeks, the blood of a young maiden,\\r\\nthe blood of sweet fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she would become abruptly savage and cease coming to watch me\\r\\npaint. I thought thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is only a fit of temper she is passing through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it did not always pass away. When I spoke to her sometimes, she\\r\\nwould answer me, either with an air of affected indifference, or in\\r\\nsullen anger; and became by turns rude, impatient, and nervous. For a\\r\\ntime I never saw her except at meals, and we spoke but little. I\\r\\nconcluded, at length, that I must have offended her in something: and,\\r\\naccordingly, I said to her one evening:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act towards me as formerly?\\r\\nWhat have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded, in an angry tone, in a manner altogether _sui generis_:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I be always with you the same as formerly.[4] It is not true, not\\r\\ntrue,\" and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt times she would look upon me with strange eyes. Since that time I\\r\\nhave often said to myself that those who are condemned to death must\\r\\nlook thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her\\r\\neye there lurked a species of folly, a folly at once mysterious and\\r\\nviolent; and even more; a fever, an exasperated desire, impatient, and\\r\\nat once incapable of being realized and unrealizable!\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, it seemed to me that there was also going on within her a combat,\\r\\nin which her heart struggled against an unknown force that she wished to\\r\\novercome, and even, perhaps, something else. But what could I know? What\\r\\ncould I know?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed a singular revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight appeared, on\\r\\na picture, the subject of which was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nA deep ravine, steep banks, dominated by two declivities, lined with\\r\\nbrambles and long rows of trees, hidden, drowned in that milky vapor,\\r\\nclad in that musty robe which sometimes floats over valleys, at break of\\r\\nday. And at the extreme end of that thick and transparent fog, you see\\r\\ncoming or, rather already come, a human couple, a stripling and a\\r\\nmaiden, embraced, inter-laced, she, with head leaning on him, he,\\r\\ninclined towards her, and lips to lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first ray of the sun glistening through the branches, has traversed\\r\\nthat fog of the dawn, has illuminated it with a rosy reflection, just\\r\\nbehind the rustic lovers, on which can be seen their vague shadows in a\\r\\nclear silver. It was well done, yes, indeed, well done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working on the declivity which led to the Val d\\'Etretat. This\\r\\nparticular morning, I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor, which\\r\\nwas necessary for my purpose. Suddenly, an object appeared in front of\\r\\nme, a kind of phantom; it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me, she took to\\r\\nflight. But I called after her saying: \"Come here, come here,\\r\\nMademoiselle, I have a nice little picture for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my\\r\\nsketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless,\\r\\nregarding it; and, suddenly, she burst into tears. She wept\\r\\nspasmodically, like men who have been struggling hard against shedding\\r\\ntears, but who can do so no longer, and abandon themselves to grief,\\r\\nthough still resisting. I got up, trembling, moved myself by the sight\\r\\nof a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her by the hand with an\\r\\nimpulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse which impels one\\r\\nquicker than one thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them quiver\\r\\nas if her whole nervous system was twisting and turning. Then she\\r\\nwithdrew her hands abruptly, or, rather tore them out of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized that shiver, as soon as I had felt it; I was deceived in\\r\\nnothing. Ah! the live shiver of a woman, whether she is fifteen or fifty\\r\\nyears of age, whether she is one of the people or one of the _monde_,\\r\\ngoes so straight to my heart that I never had any compunctions in\\r\\nunderstanding it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer whole frail being trembled, vibrated, swooned. I knew it. She walked\\r\\naway before I had time to say a word, leaving me as surprised as if I\\r\\nhad witnessed a miracle, and as troubled as if I had committed a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not go in to breakfast. I went to make a tour on the banks of the\\r\\nFalaise, feeling that I would just as lieve weep as laugh, looking on\\r\\nthe adventure as both comic and deplorable, and my position as\\r\\nridiculous, fain to believe that I had lost my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked myself what I ought to do. I debated with myself whether I ought\\r\\nto take my leave of the place and almost immediately my resolution was\\r\\nformed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time, and I\\r\\nentered the farm house just when the soup had been served up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down at the table, as usual. Miss Harriet was there, munching away\\r\\nsolemnly, without speaking to anyone, without even lifting eyes. She\\r\\nwore, however, her usual expression, both of countenance and manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited, patiently, till the meal had been finished, when, turning\\r\\ntowards the landlady I said: \"See here, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be\\r\\nlong now before I shall have to take my leave of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in a quivering\\r\\nvoice: \"My dear sir, what is it I have just heard you say? you are going\\r\\nto leave us, after I have become so much accustomed to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI regarded Miss Harriet from the corner of my eye. Her countenance did\\r\\nnot change in the least; but the under-servant came towards me with eyes\\r\\nwide open. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,\\r\\nfresh, as strong as a horse, yet possessing the rare attribute in one in\\r\\nher position--she was very neat and clean. I had embraced her at odd\\r\\ntimes, in out of the way corners, in the manner of a mountain guide,\\r\\nnothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the apple\\r\\ntrees, walking up and down at my ease, from one end of the court to the\\r\\nother. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange\\r\\ndiscovery of the morning, that grotesque love and passionate attachment\\r\\nfor me, the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,\\r\\nrecollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps, also, that look\\r\\nwhich the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my\\r\\ndeparture--all these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a\\r\\njolly humor of body, recalling the tickling sensation of kisses on the\\r\\nlips, and in the veins, something which urged me on to commit some\\r\\nfolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight having come on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, I\\r\\ndescried Céleste, who had gone to shut the hen coops, at the other end\\r\\nof the enclosure. I darted towards her, running so noiselessly that she\\r\\nheard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small traps by which\\r\\nthe chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained on her\\r\\ncoarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She made a struggle, laughing all\\r\\nthe same, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Wherefore\\r\\ndid I suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a\\r\\nshock? What was it that I heard behind me?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Miss Harriet who had come upon us, who had seen us, and who stood\\r\\nin front of us, as motionless as a specter. Then she disappeared in the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been surprised by\\r\\nher than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly that night; I was completely enervated and haunted by sad\\r\\nthoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping; but in this I was no doubt\\r\\ndeceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one\\r\\nwalking up and down in the house, and who had opened my door from the\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards morning, I was overcome by fatigue and sleep seized on me. I got\\r\\nup late and did not go downstairs until breakfast time, being still in a\\r\\nbewildered state, not knowing what kind of face to put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she did\\r\\nnot appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English\\r\\nwoman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was\\r\\nwont to do, in order to see the sun rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody seemed astonished at this and we began to eat in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was hot, very hot, one of those still, boiling days, when\\r\\nnot a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an apple\\r\\ntree; and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a jug\\r\\nof cider, everybody was so thirsty. Céleste brought the dishes from the\\r\\nkitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.\\r\\nAfterwards she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the\\r\\nseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wanted to wash and refresh these, I begged the servant to go and\\r\\nbring a pitcher of cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was dry. She\\r\\nhad lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord, and had touched\\r\\nthe bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again, it was empty. Mother\\r\\nLecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and looked\\r\\ndown the hole. She returned announcing that one could see clearly\\r\\nsomething in the well, something altogether unusual. But this, no doubt,\\r\\nwas pottles of straw, which, out of spite, had been cast down it by a\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wished also to look down the well, hoping I would be able to clear up\\r\\nthe mystery, and perched myself close to its brink. I perceived,\\r\\nindistinctly, a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the\\r\\nidea of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so, the\\r\\nyellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer.\\r\\nAll the four of us were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Céleste\\r\\nhaving now joined us. The lantern rested on a black and white,\\r\\nindistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have escaped from the meadow,\\r\\nduring the night, and fallen in headlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, suddenly, a cold shiver attacked my spine, I first recognized a\\r\\nfoot, then a clothed limb; the body was entire, but the other limb had\\r\\ndisappeared under the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned and trembled so violently that the light of the lamp danced\\r\\nhither and thither over the object, discovering a slipper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a woman! who ... who ... can it be? It is Miss Harriet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur alone did not manifest horror. He had witnessed many such scenes\\r\\nin Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste began to scream and to shriek, and ran\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead. I attached the\\r\\nvalet securely by the loins to the end of the pulley-rope, and I lowered\\r\\nhim slowly, and watched him disappear in the darkness. In the one hand\\r\\nhe had a lantern, and held on by the rope with the other. Soon I\\r\\nrecognized his voice, which seemed to come from the center of the earth,\\r\\ncrying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other limb.\\r\\nHe then bound the two feet together, and shouted anew:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haul up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI commenced to wind him up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,\\r\\nand I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When\\r\\nhis head appeared at the brink, I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\" as though I only expected that he would inform me of\\r\\nwhat he had discovered at the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both got on to the stone slab at the edge of the well, and, face to\\r\\nface, we hoisted the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste watched us from a distance, concealed from\\r\\nview behind the wall of the house. When they saw, issuing from the hole,\\r\\nthe black slippers and the white stockings of the drowned person, they\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur seized the ankles of the poor chaste woman, and we drew it up,\\r\\nsloping, as it was, in the most immodest posture. The head was shocking\\r\\nto look at, being bruised and black; and the long, gray hair, hanging\\r\\ndown tangled and disordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of all that is holy, how lean she is!\" exclaimed Sapeur, in\\r\\na contemptuous tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an\\r\\nappearance, I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse\\r\\nfor burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed her disfigured face. To the touch of my hand, an eye was\\r\\nslightly opened, which regarded me with that pale regard, with that cold\\r\\nlook, with that terrible look that corpses have, which seemed to come\\r\\nfrom beyond life. I plaited up, as well as I could, her disheveled hair,\\r\\nand I adjusted on her forehead, a novel and singularly formed lock. Then\\r\\nI took off her dripping wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of\\r\\nshame, as though I had been guilty of some profanation, her shoulders\\r\\nand her chest, and her long arms, as slim as the twigs of branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI next went to fetch some flowers, corn poppies, blue beetles,\\r\\nmarguerites, and fresh and perfumed herbs, with which to strew her\\r\\nfuneral couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI being the only person near her, it was necessary for me to perform the\\r\\nusual ceremonies. In a letter found in her pocket, written at the last\\r\\nmoment, it was ordered that her body was to be buried in the village in\\r\\nwhich she had passed the last days of her life. A frightful thought then\\r\\npressed on my heart. Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid\\r\\nto rest in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the evening, all the female gossips of the locality came to view\\r\\nthe remains of the defunct; but I would not allow a single person to\\r\\nenter; I wanted to be alone; and I watched by the corpse the whole\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the corpse by the flickering lights of the candles, this\\r\\nmiserable woman, wholly unknown, who had died lamentably and so far away\\r\\nfrom home. Had she left no friends, no relations behind her? What had\\r\\nher infancy been? What had been her life? Whence had she hailed thither\\r\\nthus, all alone, wanderer, lost like a dog driven from its home? What\\r\\nsecrets of sufferings and despair were sealed up in that disagreeable\\r\\nbody, in that spent, tarnished body--tarnished during the whole of its\\r\\nexistence, that impenetrable envelope which had driven her far away from\\r\\nall affection, from all love?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon that\\r\\nhuman creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all\\r\\nover with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which\\r\\nsustains the greatest outcasts--to wit, the hope of being loved for\\r\\nonce! Otherwise, why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from\\r\\nthe face of the others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so\\r\\npassionately, everything living that was not a man?\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized, also, that she believed in a God, and that she hoped to\\r\\nreceive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had\\r\\nendured. She had begun now to decompose, and to become, in turn, a\\r\\nplant. She who had blossomed in the sun, was now to be eaten up by the\\r\\ncattle, carried away in seeds, and flesh of beasts, would become again\\r\\nhuman flesh. But that which is called the soul, had been extinguished at\\r\\nthe bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She had changed\\r\\nher life for that of others yet to be born.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the dead. A\\r\\npale light at length announced the dawn of a new day, when a bright ray\\r\\nglistened on the bed, shed a dash of fire on the bed clothes and on her\\r\\nhands. This was the hour she had so much loved, when the awakened birds\\r\\nbegan to sing in the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened the window to its fullest extent, I drew back the curtains, so\\r\\nthat the whole heavens might look in upon us, and bending towards the\\r\\nglassy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head; then, slowly,\\r\\nwithout terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those\\r\\nlips, which had never before received any.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat\\r\\nthe Count d\\'Etraille, who blows his nose, from time to time. The\\r\\ncoachman alone had gone to sleep. The horses, which felt no longer the\\r\\nsting of the whip, had slowed their pace and dragged along softly, and\\r\\nthe brake, hardly advancing at all, became suddenly torpid, as if it had\\r\\nbeen charged with sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFRANCESCA AND CARLOTTA RONDOLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nNo (said my friend Charles Jouvent), I do not know Italy; I started to\\r\\nsee it thoroughly twice, and each time I was stopped at the frontier and\\r\\ncould not manage to get any further. And yet my two attempts gave me a\\r\\ncharming idea of the manners of that beautiful country. I must, however,\\r\\nsome time or other visit its cities, as well as the museums and works of\\r\\nart with which it abounds. I will also make another attempt to penetrate\\r\\ninto the interior, which I have not yet succeeded in doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\\'t understand me, so I will explain myself: In the spring of 1874\\r\\nI was seized with an irresistible desire to see Venice, Florence, Rome,\\r\\nand Naples. I am, as you know, not a great traveler; it appears to me a\\r\\nuseless and fatiguing business. Nights spent in a train, the disturbed\\r\\nslumbers of the railway carriage, with the attendant headache, and\\r\\nstiffness in every limb, the sudden waking in that rolling box, the\\r\\nunwashed feeling with your eyes and hair full of dust, the smell of the\\r\\ncoal on which one\\'s lungs feed, those bad dinners in the draughty\\r\\nrefreshment rooms are, according to my ideas, a horrible way of\\r\\nbeginning a pleasure trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this introduction by the express, we have the miseries of the\\r\\nhotel; of some great hotel full of people, and yet so empty; the strange\\r\\nroom, and the dubious bed! I am most particular about my bed; it is the\\r\\nsanctuary of life. We intrust our almost naked and fatigued bodies to it\\r\\nso that they may be reanimated by reposing between soft sheets and\\r\\nfeathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere we find the most delightful hours of our existence, the hours of\\r\\nlove and of sleep. The bed is sacred, and should be respected,\\r\\nvenerated, and loved by us as the best and most delightful of our\\r\\nearthly possessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot lift up the sheets of an hotel bed without a shiver of disgust.\\r\\nWhat have its occupants been doing in it the night before? Perhaps\\r\\ndirty, revolting people have slept in it. I begin, then, to think of all\\r\\nthe horrible people with whom one rubs shoulders every day, people with\\r\\nsuspicious-looking skin which makes one think of the feet and all the\\r\\nrest! I call to mind those who carry about with them the sickening smell\\r\\nof garlic or of humanity. I think of those who are deformed and\\r\\npurulent, of the perspiration emanating from the sick, and of everything\\r\\nthat is ugly and filthy in man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this, perhaps, in the bed in which I am going to sleep! The mere\\r\\nidea of it makes me feel ill as I get in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the hotel dinners--those dreary _table d\\'hôte_ dinners in the\\r\\nmidst of all sorts of extraordinary people, or else those terrible\\r\\nsolitary dinners at a small table in a restaurant, feebly lighted up by\\r\\na wretched composite candle under a shade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, those terribly dull evenings in some unknown town! Do you know\\r\\nanything more wretched than when it is getting dark on such an occasion?\\r\\nOne goes about as if almost in a dream, looking at faces which one has\\r\\nnever seen before and will never see again; listening to people talking\\r\\nabout matters which are quite indifferent to you in a language that\\r\\nperhaps you do not understand. You have a terrible feeling, almost as if\\r\\nyou were lost, and you continue to walk on so as not to be obliged to\\r\\nreturn to the hotel, where you would feel more lost still because you\\r\\nare _at home_, in a home which belongs to anyone who can pay for it, and\\r\\nat last you fall into a chair of some well-lit café, whose gilding and\\r\\nlights overwhelm you a thousand times more than the shadows in the\\r\\nstreets. Then you feel so abominably lonely sitting in front of the\\r\\nglass of flat _bock_,[5] that a kind of madness seizes you, the longing\\r\\nto go somewhere or other, no matter where, as long as you need not\\r\\nremain in front of that marble table and in the dazzling brightness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, suddenly, you perceive that you are really alone in the world,\\r\\nalways and everywhere; but that in places which we know the familiar\\r\\njostlings give us the illusion only of human fraternity. At such moments\\r\\nof self-abandonment and somber isolation in distant cities one thinks\\r\\nbroadly, clearly, and profoundly. Then one suddenly sees the whole of\\r\\nlife outside the vision of eternal hope, outside the deceptions of our\\r\\ninnate habits, and of our expectations of happiness, of which we indulge\\r\\nin dreams never to be realized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only by going a long distance that we can fully understand how\\r\\nshort-lived and empty everything near at hand is; by searching for the\\r\\nunknown we perceive how commonplace and evanescent everything is; only\\r\\nby wandering over the face of the earth can we understand how small the\\r\\nworld is, and how very much alike everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow well I know, and how I hate and almost fear those haphazard walks\\r\\nthrough unknown streets; and this was the reason why, as nothing would\\r\\ninduce me to undertake a tour in Italy by myself, I made up my mind to\\r\\naccompany my friend Paul Pavilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know Paul, and how woman is everything, the world, life itself, to\\r\\nhim. There are many men like that, to whom existence becomes poetical\\r\\nand idealized by the presence of women. The earth is inhabitable only\\r\\nbecause they are there; the sun shines and is warm because it lights\\r\\nupon them; the air is soft and balmy because it blows upon their skin\\r\\nand ruffles the short hairs on their temples, and the moon is charming\\r\\nbecause it makes them dream and imparts a languorous charm to love.\\r\\nEvery act and action of Paul\\'s has woman for its motive; all his\\r\\nthoughts, all his efforts and hopes are centered on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I mentioned Italy to Paul he at first absolutely refused to leave\\r\\nParis. I, however, began to tell him of the adventures I had on my\\r\\ntravels. I assured him that all Italian women are charming, and I made\\r\\nhim hope for the most refined pleasures at Naples, thanks to certain\\r\\nletters of introduction which I had; and so at last he allowed himself\\r\\nto be persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the express one Thursday evening, Paul and I. Hardly anyone goes\\r\\nSouth at that time of the year, so that we had the carriage to\\r\\nourselves, and both of us were in a bad temper on leaving Paris, sorry\\r\\nfor having yielded to the temptation of this journey, and regretting\\r\\nMarly, the Seine, and our lazy boating excursions, and all those\\r\\npleasures in and near Paris which are so dear to every true Parisian.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the train started Paul stuck himself into his corner, and\\r\\nsaid, \"It is most idiotic to go all that way,\" and as it was too late\\r\\nfor him to change his mind then, I said, \"Well, you should not have\\r\\ncome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me no answer, and I felt very much inclined to laugh when I saw\\r\\nhow furious he looked. He is certainly always rather like a squirrel,\\r\\nbut then every one of us has retained the type of some animal or other\\r\\nas the mark of his primitive race. How many people have jaws like a\\r\\nbull-dog, or heads like goats, rabbits, foxes, horses, or oxen. Paul is\\r\\na squirrel turned into a man. He has its bright, quick eyes, its old\\r\\nhair, pointed nose, its small, fine, supple, active body, and a certain\\r\\nmysterious resemblance in his general bearing: in fact, a similarity of\\r\\nmovements, of gestures, and of bearing which might almost be taken for a\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we both went to sleep with that uncomfortable slumber of the\\r\\nrailway carriage, which is interrupted by horrible cramps in the arms\\r\\nand neck, and by the sudden stoppages of the train.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe woke up as we were going along the Rhone. Soon the continued noise of\\r\\nthe grasshoppers came in through the window, that cry which seems to be\\r\\nthe voice of the warm earth, the song of Provence; and seemed to instill\\r\\ninto our looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling\\r\\nof the South, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light\\r\\nsoil of the olive, with its gray-green foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train stopped again a railway servant ran along the train\\r\\ncalling out \"Valence\" in a sonorous voice, with an accent that again\\r\\ngave us a taste of that Provence which the shrill note of the\\r\\ngrasshoppers had already imparted to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing new happened until we got to Marseilles, where we got out to\\r\\nbreakfast, but when we returned to our carriage we found a woman\\r\\ninstalled there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, with a delightful look at me, gave his short moustache a\\r\\nmechanical twirl, and passed his fingers through his hair, which had\\r\\nbecome slightly out of order with the night\\'s journey. Then he sat down\\r\\nopposite the newcomer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I happen to see a striking new face, either while traveling or\\r\\nin society, I always have the strongest inclination to find out what\\r\\ncharacter, mind, and intellectual capacities are hidden beneath those\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a young and pretty woman, a native of the South of France\\r\\ncertainly, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so\\r\\nthick, long, and strong that it seemed almost too heavy for her head.\\r\\nShe was dressed with a certain Southern elegant bad taste which made her\\r\\nlook a little vulgar. Her regular features had none of the grace and\\r\\nfinish of the refined races, of that slight delicacy which members of\\r\\nthe aristocracy inherit from their birth, and which is the hereditary\\r\\nmark of thinner blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer bracelets were too big to be of gold; she wore earrings with large\\r\\nwhite stones which were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged\\r\\nunmistakably to the commonalty. One would have guessed that she would\\r\\ntalk too loud, and shout on every occasion with exaggerated gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train started she remained motionless in her place, in the\\r\\nattitude of a woman who was in a rage, without even looking at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul began to talk to me, evidently with an eye to effect, trying to\\r\\nattract her attention, like shopkeepers who expose their choice wares to\\r\\ncatch the notice of passers-by.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe, however, did not appear to be paying the least attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toulon! Ten minutes to wait! Refreshment room!\" the porters shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul motioned to me to get out, and as soon as we had done so, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder who on earth she can be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to laugh. \"I am sure I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t the least care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was quite excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is an uncommonly fresh and pretty girl. What eyes she has, and how\\r\\ncross she looks. She must have been dreadfully worried, for she takes no\\r\\nnotice of anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have all your trouble for nothing,\" I growled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to lose his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not taking any trouble, my dear fellow. I think her an extremely\\r\\npretty woman, that is all. If one could only speak to her! But I don\\'t\\r\\nknow how to begin. Cannot you give me an idea? Can\\'t you guess who she\\r\\nis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot. However, I should rather think she is some\\r\\nstrolling actress who is going to rejoin her company after a love\\r\\nadventure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed quite upset, as if I had said something insulting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What makes you think that? On the contrary, I think she looks most\\r\\nrespectable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look at her bracelets,\" I said, \"her earrings and her whole dress.\\r\\nI should not be the least surprised if she were a dancer or a circus\\r\\nrider, but most likely a dancer. Her whole style smacks very much of the\\r\\ntheater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe evidently did not like the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is much too young, I am sure; why, she is hardly twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"there are many things which one can do before one is\\r\\ntwenty; dancing and reciting are among them, without counting another\\r\\nlittle business which is, perhaps, her sole occupation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take your seats for Nice, Vintimiglia,\" the guards and porters called\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got in; our fellow passenger was eating an orange, and certainly she\\r\\ndid not do it elegantly. She had spread her pocket-handkerchief on her\\r\\nknees, and the way in which she tore off the peel and opened her mouth\\r\\nto put in the figs, and then spat the pips out of the window, showed\\r\\nthat her education had been decidedly vulgar.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed, also, more put out than ever, and swallowed the fruit with\\r\\nan exceedingly comic air of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul devoured her with his eyes, and tried to attract her attention and\\r\\nexcite her curiosity, but in spite of his talk and of the manner in\\r\\nwhich he brought in well-known names, she did not pay the least\\r\\nattention to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passing Fréjus and St. Raphael, the train passed through a\\r\\nveritable garden, a paradise of roses, and groves of oranges and lemons\\r\\ncovered with fruit and flowers at the same time. That delightful coast\\r\\nfrom Marseilles to Genoa is a kingdom of perfumes in a home of flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune is the time to see it in all its beauty, when in every narrow\\r\\nvalley and on every slope, the most exquisite flowers are growing\\r\\nluxuriantly. And the roses! fields, hedges, groves of roses. They climb\\r\\nup the walls, blossom on the roofs, hang from the trees, peep out from\\r\\namong the bushes; they are white, red, yellow, large and small, single,\\r\\nwith a simple self-colored dress, or full and heavy in brilliant\\r\\ntoilets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir continual breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, while the still\\r\\nmore penetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere\\r\\ntill it might almost be called the sugar-plum of the smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless\\r\\nMediterranean. The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the\\r\\nmountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the hard, fixed blue\\r\\nsea. The train went on, through the tunnels, along the slopes, above the\\r\\nwater, on straight, wall-like viaducts, and a soft, vague, saltish\\r\\nsmell, a smell of drying seaweed, mingled at times with the strong,\\r\\nheavy perfume of the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul neither saw, looked at, nor smelled anything, for our fellow\\r\\ntraveler engrossed all his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got to Cannes, as he wished to speak to me he signed to me to\\r\\nget out again, and as soon as I had done so he took me by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, she is really charming. Just look at her eyes; and I never\\r\\nsaw anything like her hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t excite yourself,\" I replied, \"or else tackle her, if you have any\\r\\nintentions that way. She does not look impregnable, I fancy, although\\r\\nshe appears to be a little bit grumpy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you speak to her?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say, for I am always terribly stupid at first; I\\r\\ncan never make advances to a woman in the street. I follow them, go\\r\\nround and round them, and quite closely to them, but I never know what\\r\\nto say at first. I only once tried to enter into conversation with a\\r\\nwoman in that way. As I clearly saw that she was waiting for me to make\\r\\novertures, and as I felt bound to say something, I stammered out, \\'I\\r\\nhope you are quite well, madam?\\' She laughed in my face, and I made my\\r\\nescape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised Paul to do all I could to bring about a conversation, and\\r\\nwhen we had taken our places again, I politely asked our neighbor:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any objection to the smell of tobacco, madam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe merely replied, \"_Non capisco_.\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she was Italian! I felt an absurd inclination to laugh. As Paul did\\r\\nnot understand a word of that language, I was obliged to act as his\\r\\ninterpreter, so I said in Italian:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked you, madam, whether you had any objection to tobacco smoke?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an angry look she replied, \"_Che mi fa_.\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had neither turned her head nor looked at me, and I really did not\\r\\nknow whether to take this \"What does it matter to me\" for an\\r\\nauthorization, a refusal, a real sign of indifference, or for a mere\\r\\n\"Leave me alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame,\" I replied, \"if you mind the smell of tobacco in the least--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe again said, \"_Mica_,\"[8] in a tone of voice which seemed to mean, \"I\\r\\nwish to goodness you would leave me alone!\" It was, however, a kind of\\r\\npermission, so I said to Paul:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can smoke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me in that curious sort of way that people have when they\\r\\ntry to understand others who are talking in a strange language before\\r\\nthem, and asked me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked if we might smoke, and she said we might do whatever we liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon I lighted my cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did she not say anything more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had counted her words you would have noticed that she used\\r\\nexactly six, two of which gave me to understand that she knew no French,\\r\\nso four remained, and a lot can be said in four words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul seemed quite unhappy, disappointed, and \"at sea,\" so to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly the Italian asked me, in that tone of discontent which\\r\\nseemed habitual to her, \"Do you know at what time we shall get to\\r\\nGenoa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock,\" I replied. Then after a moment I went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friend and I are also going to Genoa, and if we can be of any\\r\\nservice to you, we shall be very happy, as you are quite alone.\" But she\\r\\ninterrupted with such a \"_Mica_\" that I did not venture on another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She said that she thought you were charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was in no humor for joking, and begged me, dryly, not to make\\r\\nfun of him, so I translated her question and my polite offer, which had\\r\\nbeen so rudely rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he really became as agitated as a squirrel in a cage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we only knew,\" he said, \"what hotel she was going to, we would go to\\r\\nthe same. Try and find out, so as to have another opportunity for making\\r\\nher speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not particularly easy, and I did not know what pretext to invent,\\r\\nanxious as I was to make the acquaintance of this unapproachable person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed Nice, Monaco, Mentone, and the train stopped at the frontier\\r\\nfor the examination of luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I hate those badly brought-up people who breakfast and dine in\\r\\nrailway-carriages, I went and bought a quantity of good things to make\\r\\none last attack on her by their means. I felt sure that this girl must,\\r\\nordinarily, be by no means inaccessible. Something had put her out and\\r\\nmade her irritable, but very little would suffice, a mere word or some\\r\\nagreeable offer, to decide her and overcome her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started again, and we three were still alone. I spread my eatables\\r\\nout on the seat. I cut up the fowl, put the slices of ham neatly on a\\r\\npiece of paper, and then carefully laid out our dessert, the\\r\\nstrawberries, plums, cherries, and cakes, close to the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she saw that we were going to eat she took a piece of chocolate and\\r\\ntwo little crisp cakes out of her pocket and began to munch them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask her to have some of ours,\" Paul said in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I want to do, but it is rather a difficult\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she, however, glanced from time to time at our provisions, I felt\\r\\nsure that she would still be hungry when she had finished what she had,\\r\\nso as soon as her frugal meal was over, I said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be very kind of you if you would take some of this fruit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she said \"_Mica_,\" but less crossly than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"may I offer you a little wine? I see you have not\\r\\ndrunk anything. It is Italian wine, and as we are now in your own\\r\\ncountry, we should be very pleased to see such a pretty Italian mouth\\r\\naccept the offer of its French neighbors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head slightly, evidently wishing to refuse, but very\\r\\ndesirous of accepting, and her mica _this_ time was almost polite. I\\r\\ntook the bottle, which was covered with straw in the Italian fashion,\\r\\nand filling the glass I offered it to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please drink it,\" I said, \"to bid us welcome to your country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the glass with her usual look, and emptied it at a draught,\\r\\nlike a woman tormented with thirst, and then gave it back to me without\\r\\neven saying \"Thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I offered her the cherries. \"Please take some,\" I said; \"we shall\\r\\nbe so pleased if you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of her corner she looked at all the fruit spread out before her, and\\r\\nsaid so rapidly that I could scarcely follow her: \"_A me non piacciono\\r\\nne le ciliegie ne le susine; amo soltano le fragole_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she does not care for cherries or plums, but only for\\r\\nstrawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a newspaper full of wild strawberries on her lap, and she ate them\\r\\nquickly, throwing them into her mouth from some distance in a coquettish\\r\\nand charming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had finished the little red heap which we had seen rapidly\\r\\ndiminishing, crushed and disappearing under the rapid action of her\\r\\nhands, I asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What may I offer you now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take a little chicken,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe certainly devoured half of it, tearing it to pieces with the rapid\\r\\nmovements of her jaws like some carnivorous animal. Then she made up her\\r\\nmind to have some cherries, which she \"did not like,\" then some plums,\\r\\nthen some little cakes. Then she said, \"I have had enough,\" and sat back\\r\\nin her corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was much amused, and tried to make her eat more, pressing her, in\\r\\nfact, till she suddenly got in a rage again, and flung such a furious\\r\\n_mica_ at me, that I would no longer run the risk of spoiling her\\r\\ndigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to my friend. \"My poor Paul,\" I said, \"I am afraid we have had\\r\\nour trouble for nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night came on, one of those hot summer nights which extend their\\r\\nwarm shade over the burning and exhausted earth. Here and there, in the\\r\\ndistance by the sea on capes and promontories, bright stars began to\\r\\nshine on the dark horizon, which I was, at times, almost inclined to\\r\\nconfound with lighthouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scent of the orange-trees became more penetrating, and we breathed\\r\\nwith delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply. The balmy\\r\\nair was soft, delicious, almost divine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed something like a shower of stars under the dense\\r\\nshade of the trees along the line, where it was quite dark. It might\\r\\nhave been taken for drops of light, leaping, flying, playing and running\\r\\namong the leaves, or for small stars fallen from the skies in order to\\r\\nhave an excursion on the earth; but they were only fireflies dancing a\\r\\nstrange fiery ballet in the perfumed air.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them happened to come into our carriage, and shed its\\r\\nintermittent light, which seemed to be extinguished one moment and to be\\r\\nburning the next. I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade, and\\r\\nwatched the strange fly careering about in its fiery flight. Suddenly it\\r\\nsettled on the dark hair of our neighbor, who was half dozing after\\r\\ndinner. Paul seemed delighted, with his eyes fixed on the bright,\\r\\nsparkling spot which looked like a living jewel on the forehead of the\\r\\nsleeping woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian woke up at about eleven o\\'clock, with the bright insect\\r\\nstill in her hair. When I saw her move, I said: \"We are just getting to\\r\\nGenoa, madam,\" and she murmured, without answering me, as if possessed\\r\\nby some obstinate and embarrassing thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What am I going to do, I wonder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she suddenly asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so taken aback that I really did not understand her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? How do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe repeated, looking more and more furious:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to go with you now, as soon as we get out of the\\r\\ntrain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite willing; but where do you want to go to? Where shall I take\\r\\nyou to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrugged her shoulders with an air of supreme indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wherever you like; what does it matter to me?\" She repeated her _Che mi\\r\\nfa_? twice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we are going to the hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, let us all go to the hotel,\" she said, in a contemptuous\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She wants to know if we should like her to come with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend\\'s utter surprise restored my self-possession. He stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? Where to? What for? How?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but she made this strange proposal to me in a most\\r\\nirritable voice. I told her that we were going to the hotel, and she\\r\\nsaid: \\'Very well, let us all go there!\\' I suppose she is without a\\r\\nhalfpenny. She certainly has a very strange way of making\\r\\nacquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, who was very much excited, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite agreeable. Tell her that we will take her wherever she\\r\\nlikes.\" Then, after a moment\\'s hesitation, he said uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must know, however, with whom she wants to go--with you or with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to the Italian, who did not even seem to be listening to us,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be very happy to take you with us, but my friend wants to know\\r\\nwhether you will take my arm or his?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened her black eyes wide with vague surprise, and said, \"_Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was obliged to explain myself. \"In Italy, I believe, when a man looks\\r\\nafter a woman, fulfills all her wishes, and satisfies all her caprices,\\r\\nhe is called a _patito_. Which of us two will you take for your\\r\\n_patito_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the slightest hesitation she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul. \"You see, my friend, she chooses me; you have no\\r\\nchance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the better for you,\" he replied, in a rage. Then, after thinking\\r\\nfor a few moments, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really care about taking this creature with you? She will spoil\\r\\nour journey. What are we to do with this woman, who looks like I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what? They will not take us in at any decent hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, just began to find the Italian much nicer than I had thought\\r\\nher at first, and I was now very anxious to take her with us. The idea\\r\\ndelighted me. I already felt those little shivers which the expectation\\r\\nof a night of love sends through the veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied, \"My dear fellow, we have accepted and it is too late to\\r\\nrecede. You were the first to advise me to say \\'Yes.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very stupid,\" he growled, \"but do as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train whistled, slackened speed, and we ran into the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She\\r\\njumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of\\r\\nseeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we started off\\r\\ninto the town, Paul walking in utter silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To what hotel shall we go?\" I asked him. \"It may be difficult to get\\r\\ninto the _City of Paris_ with a woman, especially with this Italian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul interrupted me. \"Yes, with an Italian who looks more like a\\r\\nstrumpet than a duchess. However, that is no business of mine. Do just\\r\\nas you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in a state of perplexity. I had written to the _City of Paris_ to\\r\\nretain our rooms, and now I did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo commissionaires followed us with our luggage. I continued: \"You\\r\\nmight as well go on first, and say that we are coming; and give the\\r\\nlandlord to understand that I have a--a friend with me, so that we\\r\\nshould like rooms quite by themselves for us three, so as not to be\\r\\nbrought in contact with other travelers. He will understand, and we will\\r\\ndecide according to his answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul growled, \"Thank you; such sort of commissions and such parts do\\r\\nnot suit me by any means. I did not come here to get ready your\\r\\napartments or to minister to your pleasures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was urgent: \"Look here, don\\'t be angry. It is surely far better to\\r\\ngo to a good hotel than to a bad one, and it is not difficult to ask the\\r\\nlandlord for three separate bedrooms and a dining-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a stress on _three_, and that decided him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on first, and I saw him go into a large hotel while I remained\\r\\non the other side of the street dragging along my fair Italian, who did\\r\\nnot say a word, and followed by the porters with the luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul came back at last, looking as dissatisfied as my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is settled,\" he said, \"and they will take us in; but there are\\r\\nonly two bedrooms. You must settle it as you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed him, rather ashamed of going in with such a strange\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two bedrooms separated by a small sitting-room. I ordered a\\r\\ncold supper, and then I turned to the Italian with a perplexed look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have only been able to get two rooms, so you must choose which you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied with her eternal _Che mi fa_? I thereupon took her little\\r\\nblack wooden box, just like servants use, and took it into the room on\\r\\nthe right, which I had chosen for her, ... for us. A bit of paper was\\r\\nfastened on to the box, on which was written, _Mademoiselle Francesca\\r\\nRondoli, Genoa_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your name is Francesca?\" I asked, and she nodded her head, without\\r\\nreplying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall have supper directly,\" I continued. \"Meanwhile, I daresay you\\r\\nwould like to arrange your dress a little?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered with a _mica_, a word which she employed just as frequently\\r\\nas _Che mi fa_, but I went on: \"It is always pleasant after a journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I suddenly remembered that she had not, perhaps, the necessary\\r\\nobjects, for she appeared to me in a very singular position, as if she\\r\\nhad just escaped from some disagreeable adventure, and I brought her my\\r\\ndressing-case.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put out all the little instruments for cleanliness and comfort which\\r\\nit contained: a nailbrush, a new toothbrush--for I always carry a\\r\\nselection of them about with me--my nail-scissors, a nail-file, and\\r\\nsponges. I uncorked a bottle of eau de cologne, one of lavender-water,\\r\\nand a little bottle of new-mown hay, so that she might have a choice.\\r\\nThen I opened my powder-box, and put out the powder-puff, put my fine\\r\\ntowels over the water-jug, and placed a piece of new soap near the\\r\\nbasin.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe watched my movements with a vexed look in her wide open eyes,\\r\\nwithout appearing either astonished or satisfied at my forethought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is all that you require,\" I then said; \"I will tell you when\\r\\nsupper is ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned to the sitting-room I found that Paul had taken\\r\\npossession of the other room, and had shut himself in, so I sat down to\\r\\nwait.\\r\\n\\r\\nA waiter went backwards and forwards, bringing plates and glasses. He\\r\\nlaid the table slowly, then put a cold fowl on it, and told me that all\\r\\nwas ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knocked gently at Mademoiselle Rondoli\\'s door. \"Come in,\" she said,\\r\\nand when I did so I was struck by a strong, heavy smell of perfumes, as\\r\\nif I were in a hairdresser\\'s and perfumer\\'s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian was sitting on her box in an attitude either of thoughtful\\r\\ndiscontent or absent-mindedness. The towel was still folded over the\\r\\nwater-jug that was quite full, and the soap, untouched and dry, was\\r\\nlaying beside the empty basin; but one would have thought that the young\\r\\nwoman had drunk half of the bottles of scent. The eau de cologne,\\r\\nhowever, had been spared, as only about a third of it had gone; but to\\r\\nmake up for that she had used a surprising amount of lavender-water and\\r\\nnew-mown hay. A cloud of violet-powder, a vague white mist, seemed still\\r\\nto be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-powdering her\\r\\nface and neck. It seemed to cover her eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hair\\r\\non her temples like snow, while her cheeks were plastered with it, and\\r\\nlayers of it covered her nostrils, the corners of her eyes, and her\\r\\nchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she got up she exhaled such a strong odor of scent that it almost\\r\\nmade me feel faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she sat down to supper, I found that Paul was in a most execrable\\r\\ntemper, and I could get nothing out of him but blame, irritable words,\\r\\nand disagreeable compliments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMademoiselle Francesca ate like an ogre, and as soon as she had finished\\r\\nher meal she threw herself upon the sofa. As for me, I saw the decisive\\r\\nmoment approaching for settling how we were to apportion the rooms. I\\r\\ndetermined to take the bull by the horns, and sitting down by the\\r\\nItalian I said gallantly, kissing her hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As we have only two bedrooms, will you allow me to share yours with\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do just as you like,\" she said. \"It is all the same to me. _Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer indifference vexed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are sure you do not mind my being in your room with you?\" I\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all the same to me; do just as you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you like to go to bed at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I am very sleepy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up, yawned, gave Paul her hand, who took it with a furious look,\\r\\nand I lighted her into our room. A disquieting feeling haunted me. \"Here\\r\\nis all you want,\" I said again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I took care to pour half the water into the basin, and to put\\r\\na towel near the soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went back to Paul. As soon as I got into the room, he said, \"You\\r\\nhave got a nice sort of camel there!\" and I answered, laughing. \"My\\r\\ndear friend, don\\'t speak ill of sour grapes,\" and he replied,\\r\\nill-temperedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just take care how this ends, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost trembled with that feeling of fear which assails us after some\\r\\nsuspicious love escapade--that fear which spoils our pleasant meetings,\\r\\nour unexpected caresses, our chance kisses. However, I put a bold face\\r\\non the matter. \"At any rate, the girl is no adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fellow had me in his power; he had seen the shadow of my anxiety\\r\\non my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about her? You really astonish me. You pick up an\\r\\nItalian woman traveling alone by railway, and she volunteers, with most\\r\\nsingular cynicism, to go and to be your mistress in the first hotel you\\r\\ncome to. You take her with you, and then you declare that she is not\\r\\na----! And you persuade yourself that you are not running more risk than\\r\\nif you were to go and spend the night with a woman who had the\\r\\nsmall-pox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed with an unpleasant and angry laugh. I sat down, a prey to\\r\\nuneasiness. What was I to do, for he was right after all? And a struggle\\r\\nbegan within me, between desire and fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"Do as you like, I have warned you, so, do not complain of\\r\\nthe consequences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I saw an ironical gayety in his eyes, such a delight in his revenge,\\r\\nand he made fun of me so jovially that I did not hesitate any longer. I\\r\\ngave him my hand, and said, \"Good night. You know the old saying: _A\\r\\nvictory without peril is a triumph without glory_, and upon my word, the\\r\\nvictory is worth the danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with a firm step I went into Francesca\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped short at the door in surprise and astonishment. She was\\r\\nalready asleep. Sleep had overcome her when she had finished undressing,\\r\\nand she was reposing in the charming attitude of one of Titian\\'s women.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed as if she had lain down from sheer fatigue in order to take\\r\\noff her stockings, for they were lying on the bed. Then she had thought\\r\\nof something pleasant, no doubt, for she had waited to finish her\\r\\nreverie before moving, and then, closing her eyes, she had lost\\r\\nconsciousness. A nightgown, embroidered about the neck such as one buys\\r\\nin cheap ready-made shops, was lying on the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was charming, young, firm and fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing prettier than a pretty woman asleep, and in a moment,\\r\\nseeing her thus in all her naïve charms, I was going to forget my\\r\\nfriend\\'s prudent counsels, but, suddenly turning to the toilet-table, I\\r\\nsaw everything in the same state as I left it, and I sat down, anxious,\\r\\nand a prey to irresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained thus for a long time, not able to make up my mind either what\\r\\nto do. Retreat was impossible, and I must either pass the night on a\\r\\nchair, or go to bed myself at my own risk and peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no thoughts of sleeping either here or there, for my head was too\\r\\nexcited and my eyes too occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved about without stopping, feverish uncomfortable, enervated. Then\\r\\nI began to reason with myself, certainly with a view to capitulation.\\r\\n\"If I lie down that does not bind me to anything, and I shall certainly\\r\\nbe more comfortable on a mattress than on a chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI undressed slowly, and then, stepping over the sleeping girl, I\\r\\nstretched myself out against the wall, turning my back on temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this position I remained for a long time without going to sleep, when\\r\\nsuddenly my neighbor woke up. She opened her eyes with astonishment, and\\r\\nstill with that discontented look in them; then, perceiving that she was\\r\\nundressed, she got up, and calmly put on her nightgown with as much\\r\\nindifference as if I had not been present.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning, she did not trouble herself at all about me, and immediately\\r\\nwent quietly to sleep again with her head resting on her right arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, I began to meditate on human weakness and fatuity, and then I\\r\\nwent to sleep also.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up early, like a woman who is used to work in the morning. She\\r\\nwoke me up by doing so, and I watched her through my half-closed\\r\\neyelids.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came and went without hurrying herself, as if she were astonished at\\r\\nhaving nothing to do. At length she went to the toilet-table, and in a\\r\\nmoment she emptied all the scent that remained in my bottles. She\\r\\ncertainly also used some water, but very little.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was quite dressed, she sat down on her box again, and holding\\r\\none knee between her hands, she seemed to be thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment I first pretended to notice her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning, Francesca.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout seeming in at all a better temper than the previous night, she\\r\\nmurmured, \"Good morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I asked her whether she slept well, she nodded _Yes_, and jumping\\r\\nout of bed, I went and kissed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her face towards me like a child who is being kissed against\\r\\nits will; but I took her tenderly in my arms, and gently put my lips on\\r\\nher large eyes, which she closed with evident distaste under my kisses\\r\\non her fresh cheeks and full lips which she turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t seem to like being kissed,\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Mica_\" was her only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the trunk by her side, and, passing my arm through hers, I\\r\\nsaid: \"_Mica! mica! mica_! in reply to everything. I shall call you\\r\\nMademoiselle _Mica_, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time I fancied that I saw the shadow of a smile on her\\r\\nlips, but it passed by so quickly that I may have been mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you never say anything but _Mica_ I shall not know what to do to\\r\\ntry to please you. Let us see; what shall we do to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated a moment as if some fancy had flitted through her head,\\r\\nand then she said carelessly: \"It is all the same to me; whatever you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, Mademoiselle _Mica_, we will have a carriage and go for a\\r\\ndrive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you please,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was waiting for us in the dining-room, looking as bored as third\\r\\nparties generally do in love affairs. I assumed a delighted air, and\\r\\nshook hands with him with triumphant energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking of doing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all we will go and see a little of the town, and then we might\\r\\ntake a carriage, for a drive in the neighborhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe breakfasted nearly in silence and then started. I dragged Francesca\\r\\nfrom palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely just\\r\\nglanced carelessly at all the various masterpieces. Paul followed us,\\r\\ngrowling all sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a\\r\\nsilent drive into the country and returned to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day it was the same thing and the next day again; so on the\\r\\nthird Paul said to me: \"Look here, I am going to leave you; I am not\\r\\ngoing to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this\\r\\ncreature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was perplexed and annoyed, for to my great surprise I had become\\r\\nsingularly attached to Francesca. A man is but weak and foolish, carried\\r\\naway by the merest trifle, and a coward every time that his senses are\\r\\nexcited or mastered. I clung to this unknown girl, silent and\\r\\ndissatisfied as she always was. I liked her somewhat ill-tempered face,\\r\\nthe dissatisfied droop of her mouth, the weariness of her look; I liked\\r\\nher fatigued movements, the contemptuous way in which she yielded to my\\r\\ndesires, the very indifference of her caresses. A secret bond, that\\r\\nmysterious bond of animal love, the secret attachment of that possession\\r\\nwhich does not satiate, bound me to her. I told Paul so, quite frankly.\\r\\nHe treated me as if I had been a fool, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, take her with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she obstinately refused to leave Genoa, without giving any reason. I\\r\\nbesought, I reasoned, I promised, but all was of no avail, and so I\\r\\nstayed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul declared that he would go by himself, and went so far as to pack up\\r\\nhis portmanteau; but he remained all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus a fortnight passed. Francesca was always silent and irritable,\\r\\nlived beside me rather than with me, responded to all my desires, all my\\r\\ndemands, and all my propositions with her perpetual _Che mi fa_, or\\r\\nwith her no less perpetual _Mica_.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend got more and more furious, but my only answer was, \"You can go\\r\\nif you are tired of staying. I am not detaining you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called me names, overwhelmed me with reproaches, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\"Where do you think I can go to now? We had three weeks at our disposal,\\r\\nand here is a fortnight gone! I cannot continue my journey now; and, in\\r\\nany case, I am not going to Venice, Florence, and Rome all by myself.\\r\\nBut you will pay for it, and more dearly than you think for, most\\r\\nlikely. You are not going to bring a man all the way from Paris in order\\r\\nto shut him up at an hotel in Genoa with an Italian adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I told him, very calmly, to return to Paris, he exclaimed that he\\r\\nwas going to do so the very next day; but the next day he was still\\r\\nthere, still in a rage and swearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time we began to be known in the streets through which we\\r\\nwandered from morning till night. Sometimes French people would turn\\r\\nround astonished at meeting their fellow-countrymen in the company of\\r\\nthis girl with her striking costume, and who looked singularly out of\\r\\nplace, not to say compromising, beside us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to walk along, leaning on my arm, without looking at anything.\\r\\nWhy did she remain with me, with us, who seemed to procure her so little\\r\\npleasure? Who was she? Where did she come from? What was she doing? Had\\r\\nshe any plan or idea? Where did she live? As an adventuress, or by\\r\\nchance meetings? I tried in vain to find out and to explain it. The\\r\\nbetter I knew her the more enigmatical she became. She was not one of\\r\\nthose who make a living by any profession of venal love. She rather\\r\\nseemed to me to be a girl of poor family who had been seduced and taken\\r\\naway, and then cast aside and lost. What did she think was going to\\r\\nbecome of her, or whom was she waiting for? She certainly did not appear\\r\\nto be trying to make a conquest of me, or to get any real profit out of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to question her, to speak to her of her childhood and family;\\r\\nbut she never gave me an answer. I stayed with her, my heart unfettered\\r\\nand my senses enchained, never wearied of holding her in my arms, that\\r\\nproud and quarrelsome woman, captivated by my senses, or rather seduced,\\r\\novercome by a youthful, healthy, powerful charm, which emanated from her\\r\\nsweet-smelling person and from the robust lines of her body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother week passed, and the term of my journey was drawing on, for I\\r\\nhad to be back in Paris by July 11. By this time Paul had come to take\\r\\nhis part in the adventure, though still grumbling at me, while I\\r\\ninvented pleasures, distractions, and excursions to amuse my mistress\\r\\nand my friend; and in order to do this I gave myself a large amount of\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day I proposed an excursion to Sta Margarita, that charming little\\r\\ntown in the midst of gardens, hidden at the foot of a slope which\\r\\nstretches far into the sea up to the village of Portofino. We all three\\r\\nwere following the excellent road which goes along the foot of the\\r\\nmountain. Suddenly Francesca said to me: \"I shall not be able to go with\\r\\nyou to-morrow; I must go and see some of my relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all; I did not ask her any questions, as I was quite sure she\\r\\nwould not answer me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she got up very early; then, as I remained in bed, she\\r\\nsat down at the foot of it, and said in a constrained and hesitating\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I do not come back to-night, shall you come and fetch me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly I shall,\" was my reply. \"Where must I come to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she explained: \"You must go into the Street Victor-Emmanuel, down\\r\\nthe Passage Falene, and go into the furniture shop at the bottom, in a\\r\\ncourt, and there you must ask for Mme. Rondoli--That is where it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she went away, leaving me rather astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Paul saw that I was alone he stammered out: \"Where is Francesca?\"\\r\\nAnd when I told him what had happened he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, let us make use of our chance, and bolt; as it is, our\\r\\ntime is up. Two days, more or less, make no difference. Let us start at\\r\\nonce; go and pack up your things. Off we go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused. I could not, as I told him, leave the girl in such a\\r\\nmanner, after having lived with her for nearly three weeks. At any rate,\\r\\nI ought to say good-bye to her, and make her accept a present; I\\r\\ncertainly had no intention of behaving badly to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he would not listen; he pressed and worried me, but I would not give\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained indoors for several hours, expecting Francesca\\'s return, but\\r\\nshe did not come, and at last, at dinner, Paul said with a triumphant\\r\\nair: \"She has thrown you over, my dear fellow; it is certainly very\\r\\nstrange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI must acknowledge that I was surprised and rather vexed. He laughed in\\r\\nmy face, and made fun of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not exactly a bad way of getting rid of you, though rather\\r\\nprimitive. \\'Just wait for me, I shall be back in a moment,\\' they often\\r\\nsay. How long are you going to wait? I should not wonder if you were\\r\\nfoolish enough to go and look for her at the address she gave you. \\'Does\\r\\nMme. Rondoli live here, please?\\' \\'No, Sir.\\' I\\'ll bet that you are\\r\\nlonging to go there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least,\" I protested, \"and I assure you that if she does not\\r\\ncome back to-morrow morning I shall start by the express at eight\\r\\no\\'clock. I shall have waited twenty-four hours, and that is enough; my\\r\\nconscience will be quite clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent an uneasy and unpleasant evening, for I really had at heart a\\r\\nvery tender feeling for her. I went to bed at twelve o\\'clock, and hardly\\r\\nslept at all. I got up at six, called Paul, packed up my things, and two\\r\\nhours later we started for France together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next year, at just about the same period, I was seized, as one is\\r\\nwith a periodical fever, with a new desire to go to Italy, and I\\r\\nimmediately made up my mind to carry it into effect. There is no doubt\\r\\nthat every well-educated man ought to see Florence, Venice, and Rome. It\\r\\nhas, also, the additional advantage of providing many subjects of\\r\\nconversation in society, and of giving one an opportunity for bringing\\r\\nforward artistic generalities which appear profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I went alone, and I arrived at Genoa at the same time as the\\r\\nyear before, but without any adventure on the road. I went to the same\\r\\nhotel, and actually happened to have the same room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was scarcely in bed when the recollection of Francesca which, since\\r\\nthe evening before, had been floating vaguely through my mind, haunted\\r\\nme with strange persistency. I thought of her nearly the whole night,\\r\\nand by degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at\\r\\nfirst, which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up\\r\\nmy mind to spend the next day in Genoa to try and find her, and if I\\r\\nshould not succeed, I would take the evening train.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning I set out on my search. I remembered the directions\\r\\nshe had given me when she left me, perfectly--Victor-Emmanuel Street,\\r\\netc., etc., house of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on\\r\\nthe right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it without the least difficulty, and I knocked at the door of a\\r\\nsomewhat dilapidated-looking dwelling. A fat woman opened it, who must\\r\\nhave been very handsome, but who actually was only very dirty. Although\\r\\nshe was too fat, she still bore the lines of majestic beauty; her untidy\\r\\nhair fell over her forehead and shoulders, and one fancied one could see\\r\\nher fat body floating about in an enormous dressing-gown covered with\\r\\nspots of dirt and grease. Round her neck she wore a great gilt necklace,\\r\\nand on her wrists were splendid bracelets of Genoa filigree work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rather a hostile manner she asked me what I wanted, and I replied by\\r\\nrequesting her to tell me whether Francesca Rondoli lived there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want with her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had the pleasure of meeting her last year, and I should like to see\\r\\nher again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman looked at me suspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you meet her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why here, in Genoa itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated a moment, and then I told her. I had scarcely done so when\\r\\nthe Italian put out her arms as if to embrace me. \"Oh! you are the\\r\\nFrenchman; how glad I am to see you! But what grief you caused the poor\\r\\nchild. She waited for you a month; yes, a whole month. At first she\\r\\nthought you would come to fetch her. She wanted to see whether you loved\\r\\nher. If you only knew how she cried when she saw that you were not\\r\\ncoming! She cried till she seemed to have no tears left. Then she went\\r\\nto the hotel, but you had gone. She thought that most likely you were\\r\\ntraveling in Italy, and that you would return by Genoa to fetch her, as\\r\\nshe would not go with you. And she waited more than a month, Monsieur;\\r\\nand she was so unhappy; so unhappy. I am her mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI really felt a little disconcerted, but I regained my self-possession,\\r\\nand asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has gone to Paris with a painter, a delightful man, who loves her\\r\\nvery much, and who gives her everything that she wants. Just look at\\r\\nwhat she sent me; they are very pretty, are they not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she showed me, with quite Southern animation, her heavy bracelets\\r\\nand necklace. \"I have also,\" she continued, \"earrings with stones in\\r\\nthem, a silk dress, and some rings; but I only wear them on grand\\r\\noccasions. Oh! she is very happy, Sir, very happy. She will be so\\r\\npleased when I tell her you have been here. But pray come in and sit\\r\\ndown. You will take something or other, surely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused, as I now wished to get away by the first train; but she\\r\\ntook me by the arm and pulled me in, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please, come in; I must tell her that you have been in here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI found myself in a small, rather dark room, furnished with only a table\\r\\nand a few chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"O! She is very happy now, very happy. When you met her\\r\\nin the train she was very miserable, for her lover had just left her at\\r\\nMarseilles, and she was coming back, poor child. But she liked you at\\r\\nonce, though she was still rather sad, you understand. Now she has all\\r\\nshe wants, and she writes and tells me everything that she does. His\\r\\nname is Bellemin, and they say he is a great painter in your country. He\\r\\nmet her in the street here, and fell in love with her out of hand. But\\r\\nyou will take a glass of syrup?--it is very good. Are you quite alone,\\r\\nthis year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"quite alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt an increasing inclination to laugh, as my first disappointment\\r\\nwas dispelled by what Mother Rondoli said. I was obliged, however, to\\r\\ndrink a glass of her syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you are quite alone?\" she continued. \"How sorry I am that Francesca\\r\\nis not here now; she would have been company for you all the time you\\r\\nstayed. It is not very amusing to go about all by oneself, and she will\\r\\nbe very sorry also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting up to go, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But would you not like Carlotta to go with you? She knows all the\\r\\nwalks very well. She is my second daughter, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt she took my look of surprise for consent, for she opened the\\r\\ninner door and called out up the dark stairs which I could not see:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Carlotta! Carlotta! make haste down, my dear child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to protest, but she would not listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; she will be very glad to go with you; she is very nice, and much\\r\\nmore cheerful than her sister, and she is a good girl, a very good girl,\\r\\nwhom I love very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments, a tall, slender, dark girl appeared, with her hair\\r\\nhanging down, and whose youthful figure showed unmistakably beneath an\\r\\nold dress of her mother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter at once told her how matters stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Francesca\\'s Frenchman, you know, the one whom she knew last\\r\\nyear. He is quite alone, and has come to look for her, poor fellow; so I\\r\\ntold him that you would go with him to keep him company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked at me with her handsome dark eyes, and said, smiling:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no objection, if he wishes it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not possibly refuse, and merely said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I shall be very glad of your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother pushed her out. \"Go and get dressed directly; put on your\\r\\nblue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had left the room the old woman explained herself: \"I\\r\\nhave two others, but they are much younger. It costs a lot of money to\\r\\nbring up four children. Luckily the eldest is off my hands at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told all about herself, about her husband, who had been an\\r\\nemployé on the railway, but who was dead, and she expatiated on the good\\r\\nqualities of Carlotta, her second girl, who soon returned, dressed, as\\r\\nher sister had been, in a striking, peculiar manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother examined her from head to foot, and, after finding everything\\r\\nright, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my children, you can go.\" Then turning to the girl, she said: \"Be\\r\\nsure you are back by ten o\\'clock to-night; you know the door is locked\\r\\nthen.\" The answer was:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, mamma; don\\'t alarm yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took my arm, and we went wandering about the streets, just as I had\\r\\ndone the previous year with her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the hotel for lunch, and then I took my new friend to\\r\\nSanta Margarita, just as I had done with her sister the year previously.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she did not go home that night, although the door was to be closed\\r\\nat ten o\\'clock!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole fortnight which I had at my disposal I took Carlotta to\\r\\nall the places of interest in and about Genoa. She gave me no cause to\\r\\nregret the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cried when I left her, and the morning of my departure I gave her\\r\\nfour bracelets for her mother, besides a substantial token of my\\r\\naffection for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days I intend to return to Italy, and I cannot help\\r\\nremembering, with a certain amount of uneasiness, mingled with hope,\\r\\nthat Mme. Rondoli has two more daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHÂLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral de la Vallee, who seemed to be half asleep in his armchair, said\\r\\nin a voice which sounded like an old woman\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had a very singular little love adventure once; would you like to\\r\\nhear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke from the depths of his great chair, with that everlasting dry,\\r\\nwrinkled smile on his lips, that smile _à la Voltaire_, which made\\r\\npeople take him for a terrible skeptic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thirty years of age and first lieutenant in the navy, when I was\\r\\nintrusted with an astronomical expedition to Central India. The English\\r\\nGovernment provided me with all the necessary means for carrying out my\\r\\nenterprise, and I was soon busied with a few followers in that strange,\\r\\nsurprising, prodigious country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would take me ten volumes to relate that journey. I went through\\r\\nwonderfully magnificent regions, and was received by strangely handsome\\r\\nprinces, who entertained me with incredible magnificence. For two months\\r\\nit seemed to me as if I were walking in a poem, and that I was going\\r\\nabout in a fairy kingdom, on the back of imaginary elephants. In the\\r\\nmidst of wild forests I discovered extraordinary ruins, delicate and\\r\\nchiseled like jewels, fine as lace and enormous as mountains, those\\r\\nfabulous, divine monuments which are so graceful that one falls in love\\r\\nwith their form like one falls in love with a woman, and that one feels\\r\\na physical and sensual pleasure in looking at them. As Victor Hugo says,\\r\\n\"_Whilst wide-awake, I was walking in a dream_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of my journey I reached Ganhard, which was formerly one\\r\\nof the most prosperous towns in Central India, but is now much decayed\\r\\nand governed by a wealthy, arbitrary, violent, generous, and cruel\\r\\nprince. His name is Rajah Maddan, a true Oriental potentate, delicate\\r\\nand barbarous, affable and sanguinary, combining feminine grace with\\r\\npitiless ferocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city lies at the bottom of a valley, on the banks of a little lake\\r\\nwhich is surrounded by pagodas, which bathe their walls in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance the city looks like a white spot which grows larger as one\\r\\napproaches it, and by degrees one discovers the domes and spires, all\\r\\nthe slender and graceful summits of Indian monuments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about an hour\\'s distance from the gates, I met a superbly caparisoned\\r\\nelephant, surrounded by a guard of honor which the sovereign had sent\\r\\nme, and I was conducted to the palace with great ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have liked to have taken the time to put on my gala uniform,\\r\\nbut royal impatience would not admit of it. He was anxious to make my\\r\\nacquaintance, to know what he might expect from me, and then he would\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was introduced into a great hall surrounded by galleries, in the midst\\r\\nof bronze-colored soldiers in splendid uniforms, while all about were\\r\\nstanding men dressed in striking robes studded with precious stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw a shining mass, a kind of sitting sun reposing on a bench like\\r\\nour garden benches, without a back; it was the rajah who was waiting for\\r\\nme, motionless, in a robe of the purest canary color. He had some ten or\\r\\nfifteen million francs worth of diamonds on him, and by itself, on his\\r\\nforehead glistened the famous star of Delhi, which has always belonged\\r\\nto the illustrious dynasty of the Pariharas of Mundore, from whom my\\r\\nhost was descended.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about five-and-twenty, who seemed to have some negro\\r\\nblood in his veins, although he belonged to the purest Hindoo race. He\\r\\nhad large, almost motionless, rather vague eyes, fat lips, a curly\\r\\nbeard, low forehead, and dazzling sharp white teeth, which he frequently\\r\\nshowed with a mechanical smile. He got up and gave me his hand in the\\r\\nEnglish fashion, and then made me sit down beside him on a bench which\\r\\nwas so high that my feet hardly touched the ground, and I was very\\r\\nuncomfortable on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately proposed a tiger hunt for the next day; war and hunting\\r\\nwere his chief occupations, and he could hardly understand how one could\\r\\ncare for anything else. He was evidently fully persuaded that I had only\\r\\ncome all that distance to amuse him a little, and to be the companion of\\r\\nhis pleasures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood greatly in need of his assistance, I tried to flatter his\\r\\ntastes, and he was so pleased with me that he immediately wished to show\\r\\nme how his trained boxers fought, and he led the way into a kind of\\r\\narena situated within the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his command two naked men appeared, their hands covered with steel\\r\\nclaws. They immediately began to attack each other, trying to strike one\\r\\nanother with this sharp weapon, which left long cuts, from which the\\r\\nblood flowed freely down their dark skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt lasted for a long time, till their bodies were a mass of wounds, and\\r\\nthe combatants were tearing each other\\'s flesh with this sort of rake\\r\\nmade of pointed blades. One of them had his jaw smashed, while the ear\\r\\nof the other was split into three pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked on with ferocious pleasure, uttered grunts of delight,\\r\\nand imitated all their movements with careless gestures, crying out\\r\\nconstantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike, strike hard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fell down unconscious, and had to be carried out of the arena,\\r\\ncovered with blood, while the rajah uttered a sigh of regret because it\\r\\nwas over so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to me to know my opinion; I was disgusted, but I congratulated\\r\\nhim loudly. He then gave orders that I was to be conducted to\\r\\nCouch-Mahal (the palace of pleasure), where I was to be lodged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bijou palace was situated at the extremity of the royal park, and\\r\\none of its walls was built into the sacred lake of Vihara. It was\\r\\nsquare, with three rows of galleries with colonnades of most beautiful\\r\\nworkmanship. At each angle there were light, lofty or low towers,\\r\\nstanding either singly or in pairs: no two were alike, and they looked\\r\\nlike flowers growing out of that graceful plant of Oriental\\r\\narchitecture. All were surmounted by fantastic roofs, like coquettish\\r\\nladies\\' caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the edifice a large dome raised its round cupola like a\\r\\nlarge white woman\\'s breast, beside a beautiful clock-tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole building was covered with sculpture from top to bottom, with\\r\\nthose exquisite arabesques which delight the eye, of motionless\\r\\nprocessions of delicate figures whose attitudes and gestures in stone\\r\\ntold the story of Indian manners and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rooms were lighted by windows with dentelated arches, looking on to\\r\\nthe gardens. On the marble floor were designs of graceful bouquets in\\r\\nonyx, lapis-lazuli, and agate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely had time to finish my toilet when Haribada, a court\\r\\ndignitary who was specially charged to communicate between the prince\\r\\nand me, announced his sovereign\\'s visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saffron-colored rajah appeared, again shook hands with me, and began\\r\\nto tell me a thousand different things, constantly asking me for my\\r\\nopinion, which I had great difficulty in giving him. Then he wished to\\r\\nshow me the ruins of the former palace at the other extremity of the\\r\\ngardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a real forest of stones inhabited by a large tribe of apes. On\\r\\nour approach the males began to run along the walls, making the most\\r\\nhideous faces at us, while the females ran away, showing their bare\\r\\nrumps, and carrying off their young in their arms. The rajah shouted\\r\\nwith laughter and pinched my arm to draw my attention, and to testify\\r\\nhis own delight, and sat down in the midst of the ruins, while around\\r\\nus, squatting on the top of the walls, perching on every eminence, a\\r\\nnumber of animals with white whiskers put out their tongues and shook\\r\\ntheir fists at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had seen enough of this, the yellow rajah rose and began to walk\\r\\nsedately on, keeping me always at his side, happy at having shown me\\r\\nsuch things on the very day of my arrival, and reminding me that a grand\\r\\ntiger-hunt was to take place the next day, in my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was present at it, at a second, a third, at ten, twenty in succession.\\r\\nWe hunted all the animals which the country produces in turn; the\\r\\npanther, the bear, elephant, antelope, the hippopotamus and the\\r\\ncrocodile--what do I know of, half the beasts in creation I should say.\\r\\nI was disgusted at seeing so much blood flow, and tired of this\\r\\nmonotonous pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the prince\\'s ardor abated and, at my urgent request, he left\\r\\nme a little leisure for work, and contented himself by loading me with\\r\\ncostly presents. He sent me jewels, magnificent stuffs, and well-broken\\r\\nanimals of all sorts, which Haribada presented to me with apparently as\\r\\ngrave respect as if I had been the sun himself although he heartily\\r\\ndespised me at the bottom of his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day a procession of servants brought me in covered dishes, a\\r\\nportion of each course that was served at the royal table; every day he\\r\\nseemed to take an extreme pleasure in getting up some new entertainment\\r\\nfor me--dances by the Bayaderes, jugglers, reviews of the troops, and I\\r\\nwas obliged to pretend to be most delighted with it, so as not to hurt\\r\\nhis feelings when he wished to show me his wonderful country in all its\\r\\ncharm and all its splendor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as I was left alone for a few moments I either worked or went to\\r\\nsee the monkeys, whose company pleased me a great deal better than that\\r\\nof their royal master.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, however, on coming back from a walk, I found Haribada\\r\\noutside the gate of my palace. He told me in mysterious tones that a\\r\\ngift from the king was waiting for me in my room, and he said that his\\r\\nmaster begged me to excuse him for not having sooner thought of offering\\r\\nme that of which I had been deprived for such a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these obscure remarks the ambassador bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went in I saw six little girls standing against the wall\\r\\nmotionless, side-by-side, like smelts on a skewer. The eldest was\\r\\nperhaps ten and the youngest eight years old. For the first moment I\\r\\ncould not understand why this girls\\' school had taken up its abode in my\\r\\nrooms; then, however, I divined the prince\\'s delicate attention: he had\\r\\nmade me a present of a harem, and had chosen it very young from an\\r\\nexcess of generosity. There, the more unripe the fruit is, in the higher\\r\\nestimation it is held.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I remained confused and embarrassed, ashamed in the\\r\\npresence of these children, who looked at me with great grave eyes which\\r\\nseemed already to divine what I should want of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not know what to say to them; I felt inclined to send them back;\\r\\nbut one cannot return the presents of a prince; it would have been a\\r\\nmortal insult. I was obliged, therefore, to keep them, and to install\\r\\nthis troop of children in my rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood motionless, looking at me, waiting for my orders, trying to\\r\\nread my thoughts in my eyes. Confound such a present! How dreadfully it\\r\\nwas in my way. At last, thinking that I must be looking rather\\r\\nridiculous, I asked the eldest her name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Châli,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little creature, with her beautiful skin, which was slightly\\r\\nyellow, like old ivory, was a marvel, a perfect statue, with her face\\r\\nand its long and severe lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then asked, in order to see what she would reply, and also, perhaps,\\r\\nto embarrass her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you come here for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied, in her soft, harmonious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come to be altogether at my lord\\'s disposal, and to do whatever\\r\\nhe wishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was evidently quite resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put the same question to the youngest, who answered immediately in her\\r\\nshrill voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here to do whatever you ask me, my master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one was like a little mouse, and was very taking, just as they all\\r\\nwere, so I took her in my arms and kissed her. The others made a\\r\\nmovement to go away, thinking, no doubt, that I had made my choice; but\\r\\nI ordered them to stay, and sitting down in the Indian fashion, I made\\r\\nthem all sit round me, and began to tell them fairy-tales, for I spoke\\r\\ntheir language tolerably well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey listened very attentively, and trembled, wringing their hands in\\r\\nagony. Poor little things, they were not thinking any longer of the\\r\\nreason why they were sent to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had finished my story, I called Latchmân, my confidential\\r\\nservant, and made him bring sweetmeats and cakes, of which they ate\\r\\nenough to make themselves ill; then, as I began to find the adventure\\r\\nrather funny, I organized games to amuse my wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these diversions had an enormous success. I made a bridge of my\\r\\nlegs, and the six children ran underneath, the smallest beginning and\\r\\nthe tallest always knocking against them a little, because she did not\\r\\nstoop enough. It made them shout with laughter, and these young voices\\r\\nsounding beneath the low vaults of my sumptuous palace, seemed to wake\\r\\nit up and to people it with childlike gaiety, filling it with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext I took great interest in seeing to the sleeping apartments of my\\r\\ninnocent concubines, and in the end I saw them safely locked up under\\r\\nthe surveillance of four female servants, whom the prince had sent me at\\r\\nthe same time in order to take care of my sultanas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a week I took the greatest pleasure in acting the papa towards\\r\\nthese living dolls. We had capital games of _hide-and-seek_,\\r\\n_puss-in-the-corner_, &c., which gave them the greatest pleasure, for\\r\\nevery day I taught them a new game, to their intense delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy house now seemed to be one large class, and my little friends,\\r\\ndressed in beautiful silk stuffs, and in materials embroidered with gold\\r\\nand silver, ran up and down the long galleries and the quiet rooms like\\r\\nlittle human animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one evening, without my knowing exactly how it happened, the\\r\\noldest of them, the one called Châli, and who looked so like an ivory\\r\\nstatue, became my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an adorable little creature, timid and gentle, who soon got to\\r\\nlove me ardently, with some degree of shame, with hesitation as if\\r\\nafraid of European justice, with reserve and scruples, and yet with\\r\\npassionate tenderness. I cherished her as if I had been her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg your pardon, ladies; I am going rather too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others continued to play in the palace, like a lot of happy kittens,\\r\\nand Châli never left me except when I went to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed delicious hours together in the ruins of the old castle, among\\r\\nthe monkeys, who had become our friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to lie on my knees, and remain there, turning all sorts of\\r\\nthings over in her little sphinx\\'s head, or perhaps not thinking of\\r\\nanything, retaining that beautiful, charming, hereditary pose of that\\r\\nnoble and dreamy people, the hieratic pose of the sacred statues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large brass dish I had brought provisions, cakes, fruits. The apes\\r\\ncame nearer and nearer, followed by their young ones, who were more\\r\\ntimid; at last they sat down round us in a circle, without daring to\\r\\ncome any nearer, waiting for me to distribute my delicacies. Then,\\r\\nalmost invariably, a male more daring than the rest would come to me\\r\\nwith outstretched hand, like a beggar, and I would give him something,\\r\\nwhich he would take to his wife. All the others immediately began to\\r\\nutter furious cries, cries of rage and jealousy; and I could not make\\r\\nthe terrible racket cease except by throwing each one his share.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was very comfortable in the ruins I had my instruments brought\\r\\nthere, so that I might be able to work. As soon, however, as they saw\\r\\nthe copper fittings on my scientific instruments, the monkeys, no doubt\\r\\ntaking them for some deadly engines, fled on all sides, uttering the\\r\\nmost piercing cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nI often also spent my evenings with Châli on one of the external\\r\\ngalleries that looked on to the lake of Vihara. Without speaking we\\r\\nlooked at the bright moon gliding over the sky and throwing a mantle of\\r\\ntrembling silver over the water, and down there, on the further shore,\\r\\nthe row of small pagodas like elegant mushrooms with their stalks in the\\r\\nwater. Taking the thoughtful head of my little mistress between my\\r\\nhands, I printed a long, soft kiss on her polished brow, on her great\\r\\neyes, which were full of the secret of that ancient and fabulous land,\\r\\nand on her calm lips which opened to my caress. I felt a confused,\\r\\npowerful, above all, a poetical, sensation, the sensation that I\\r\\npossessed a whole race in this little girl, that mysterious race from\\r\\nwhich all the others seem to have taken their origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, however, continued to load me with presents. One day he sent\\r\\nme a very unexpected object, which excited a passionate admiration in\\r\\nChâli. It was merely one of those cardboard boxes covered with shells\\r\\nstuck on outside, and they can be bought at any European seaside resort\\r\\nfor a penny or two. But there it was a jewel beyond price, and no doubt\\r\\nwas the first that had found its way into the kingdom. I put it on a\\r\\ntable and left it there, wondering at the value which was set upon this\\r\\ntrumpery article out of a bazaar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Châli never got tired of looking at it, of admiring it ecstatically.\\r\\nFrom time to time she would say to me, \"May I touch it?\" And when I had\\r\\ngiven her permission she raised the lid, closed it again with the\\r\\ngreatest precaution, touched the shells very gently, and the contact\\r\\nseemed to give her real physical pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I had finished my work, and it was time for me to return. I was\\r\\na long time in making up my mind, kept back by my tenderness for my\\r\\nlittle friend, but at last I was obliged to fix the day of my departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince got up fresh hunting excursions and fresh wrestling matches,\\r\\nand after a fortnight of these pleasures I declared that I could stay no\\r\\nlonger, and he gave me my liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy farewell from Châli was heartrending. She wept, lying beside me, with\\r\\nher head on my breast, shaken with sobs. I did not know how to console\\r\\nher; my kisses were no good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an idea struck me, and getting up I went and got the\\r\\nshell-box, and putting it into her hands, I said, \"That is for you; it\\r\\nis yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw her smile at first. Her whole face was lighted up with\\r\\ninternal joy, with that profound joy when impossible dreams are suddenly\\r\\nrealized, and she embraced me ardently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, she wept bitterly when I bade her a last farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave paternal kisses and cakes to all the rest of my wives, and then I\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years had passed when my duties again called me to Bombay, and,\\r\\nbecause I knew the country and the language well, I was left there to\\r\\nundertake another mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finished what I had to do as quickly as possible, and as I had a\\r\\nconsiderable amount of spare time on my hands I determined to go and see\\r\\nmy friend the King of Ganhard and my dear little Châli once more, though\\r\\nI expected to find her much changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rajah received me with every demonstration of pleasure, and hardly\\r\\nleft me for a moment during the first day of my visit. At night,\\r\\nhowever, when I was alone, I sent for Haribada, and after several\\r\\nmisleading questions I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know what has become of little Châli, whom the rajah gave me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately assumed a sad and troubled look, and said, in evident\\r\\nembarrassment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had better not speak of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why? She was a dear little woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She turned out badly, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--Châli? What has become of her? Where is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean to say that she came to a bad end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bad end! Is she dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. She committed a very dreadful action.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very much distressed. I felt my heart beat, and my breast was\\r\\noppressed with grief, and insisted on knowing what she had done and what\\r\\nhad happened to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man became more and more embarrassed, and murmured, \"You had better\\r\\nnot ask about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She stole--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who--Châli? What did she steal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something that belonged to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me? What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day you left she stole that little box which the prince had given\\r\\nyou; it was found in her hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What box are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The box covered with shells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I gave it to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian looked at me with stupefaction, then replied: \"Well, she\\r\\ndeclared with the most sacred oaths that you had given it to her, but\\r\\nnobody could believe that you could have given a king\\'s present to a\\r\\nslave, and so the rajah had her punished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was she punished? What was done to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was tied up in a sack, and thrown into the lake from this window,\\r\\nfrom the window of the room in which we are, where she had committed the\\r\\ntheft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt the most terrible grief that I ever experienced, and I made a\\r\\nsign to Haribada to go away, so that he might not see my tears; and I\\r\\nspent the night on the gallery that looked on to the lake, on the\\r\\ngallery where I had so often held the poor child on my knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pictured to myself her pretty little body lying decomposed in a sack\\r\\nin the dark waters beneath me, which we had so often looked at together\\r\\nformerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day I left again, in spite of the rajah\\'s entreaties and\\r\\nevident vexation; and I now still feel as if I had never loved any woman\\r\\nbut Châli.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UMBRELLA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille was a very economical woman; she thoroughly knew the value\\r\\nof a halfpenny, and possessed a whole storehouse of strict principles\\r\\nwith regard to the multiplication of money, so that her cook found the\\r\\ngreatest difficulty in making what the servants call their\\r\\n_market-penny_, while her husband was hardly allowed any pocket-money at\\r\\nall. They were, however, very comfortably off, and had no children; but\\r\\nit really pained Mme. Oreille to see any money spent; it was like\\r\\ntearing at her heartstrings when she had to take any of those nice\\r\\ncrown-pieces out of her pocket; and whenever she had to spend anything,\\r\\nno matter how necessary it was, she slept badly the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was continually saying to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really might be more liberal, as we have no children, and never\\r\\nspend our income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know what may happen,\" she used to reply. \"It is better to\\r\\nhave too much than too little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little woman of about forty, very active, rather hasty,\\r\\nwrinkled, very neat and tidy, and with a very short temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband very often used to complain of all the privations she made\\r\\nhim endure; some of them were particularly painful to him, as they\\r\\ntouched his vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was one of the upper clerks in the War Office, and only kept on there\\r\\nin obedience to his wife\\'s wish, so as to increase their income, which\\r\\nthey did not nearly spend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched\\r\\numbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow-clerks. At last he got\\r\\ntired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife buying him a new one.\\r\\nShe bought one for eight francs and a half, one of those cheap articles\\r\\nwhich large houses sell as an advertisement. When the others in the\\r\\noffice saw the article, which was being sold in Paris by the thousands,\\r\\nthey began their jokes again, and Oreille had a dreadful time of it with\\r\\nthem, and they even made a song about it, which he heard from morning\\r\\ntill night all over the immense building.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new\\r\\none, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so\\r\\nthat he might see that it was all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger\\r\\nas she gave it to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will last you for five years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille felt quite triumphant, and obtained a small ovation at the\\r\\noffice with his new acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he went home in the evening, his wife said to him, looking at the\\r\\numbrella uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very\\r\\nlikely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a\\r\\nnew one in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, unfastened it, and remained dumbfounded with astonishment\\r\\nand rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a\\r\\nsixpenny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband replied quietly, without looking at it: \"What is it? What do\\r\\nyou mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was choking with rage, and could hardly get out a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--you--have burnt--your umbrella! Why--you must be--mad! Do you wish\\r\\nto ruin us outright?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round, and felt that he was growing pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say that you have burnt your umbrella. Just look here--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rushing at him as if she were going to beat him, she violently\\r\\nthrust the little circular burnt hole under his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so utterly struck dumb at the sight of it that he could only\\r\\nstammer out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--what is it? How should I know? I have done nothing, I will swear.\\r\\nI don\\'t know what is the matter with the umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been playing tricks with it at the office; you have been\\r\\nplaying the fool and opening it, to show it off,\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only opened it once, to let them see what a nice one it was, that is\\r\\nall, I declare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she shook with rage, and got up one of those conjugal scenes which\\r\\nmake a peaceable man dread the domestic hearth more than a battlefield\\r\\nwhere bullets are raining.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mended it with a piece of silk cut out of the old umbrella, which\\r\\nwas of a different color, and the next day Oreille went off very humbly\\r\\nwith the mended article in his hand. He put it into a cupboard, and\\r\\nthought no more about it than one thinks of some unpleasant\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the\\r\\numbrella from him, opened it, and nearly had a fit when she saw what had\\r\\nbefallen it, for the disaster was irreparable. It was covered with small\\r\\nholes, which, evidently, proceeded from burns, just as if someone had\\r\\nemptied the ashes from a lighted pipe on to it. It was done for utterly,\\r\\nirreparably.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at it without a word, in too great a passion to be able to\\r\\nsay anything. He also, when he saw the damage, remained almost struck\\r\\nstupid, in a state of frightened consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other, then he looked on to the floor; and the next\\r\\nmoment she threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a\\r\\ntransport of the most violent rage, for she had recovered her voice by\\r\\nthat time:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you brute! you brute! You did it on purpose, but I will pay you out\\r\\nfor it. You shall not have another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the scene began again, and after the storm had raged for an\\r\\nhour, he, at last, was enabled to explain himself. He declared that he\\r\\ncould not understand it at all, and that it could only proceed from\\r\\nmalice or from vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ring at the bell saved him; it was a friend whom they were expecting\\r\\nfor dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille submitted the case to him. As for buying a new umbrella,\\r\\nthat was out of the question; her husband should not have another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend very sensibly said that in that case his clothes would be\\r\\nspoilt, and they were certainly worth more than the umbrella. But the\\r\\nlittle woman, who was still in a rage, replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then, when it rains he may have the kitchen umbrella, for I\\r\\nwill not give him a new silk one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille utterly rebelled at such an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said; \"then I shall resign my post. I am not going to\\r\\nthe office with the kitchen umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend interposed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have this one re-covered; it will not cost much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mme. Oreille, being in the temper that she was, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will cost at least eight francs to re-cover it. Eight and eighteen\\r\\nare twenty-six. Just fancy, twenty-six francs for an umbrella! It is\\r\\nutter madness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend, who was only a poor man of the middle-classes, had an\\r\\ninspiration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make your Fire Assurance pay for it. The companies pay for all articles\\r\\nthat are burnt, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this advice the little woman calmed down immediately, and\\r\\nthen, after a moment\\'s reflection, she said to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, before going to your office, you will go to the _Maternelle_\\r\\nAssurance Company, show them the state your umbrella is in, and make\\r\\nthem pay for the damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Oreille fairly jumped, he was so startled at the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not do it for my life! It is eighteen francs lost that is all.\\r\\nIt will not ruin us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he took a walking-stick when he went out, and, luckily,\\r\\nit was a fine day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft at home alone, Mme. Oreille could not get over the loss of her\\r\\neighteen francs by any means. She had put the umbrella on the\\r\\ndining-room table, and she looked at it without being able to come to\\r\\nany determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment she thought of the Assurance Company, but she did not dare\\r\\nto encounter the quizzical looks of the gentlemen who might receive her,\\r\\nfor she was very timid before people, and grew red at a mere nothing,\\r\\nand was embarrassed when she had to speak to strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she\\r\\nhad been wounded. She tried not to think of it any more, and yet every\\r\\nmoment the recollection of the loss struck her painfully. What was she\\r\\nto do, however? Time went on, and she could not decide; but suddenly,\\r\\nlike all cowards, on becoming determined, she made up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go, and we will see what will happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the\\r\\ndisaster might be complete, and the reason of it quite evident. She took\\r\\na match from the mantelpiece, and between the ribs she burnt a hole as\\r\\nbig as the palm of her hand; then she delicately rolled it up, fastened\\r\\nit with the elastic band, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quickly\\r\\ntowards the Rue de Rivoli, where the Assurance Office was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the nearer she got the slower she walked. What was she going to say,\\r\\nand what reply would she get?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the numbers of the houses; there were still twenty-eight.\\r\\nThat was all right, so she had time to consider, and she walked slower\\r\\nand slower. Suddenly she saw a door on which was a large brass plate\\r\\nwith \"_La Maternelle_ Fire Assurance Office\" engraved on it. Already!\\r\\nShe waited for a moment, for she felt nervous and almost ashamed; then\\r\\nshe went past, came back, went past again, and came back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she said to herself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go in, however, so I may as well do it sooner as later.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not help noticing, however, how her heart beat as she entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went into an enormous room with grated wicket openings all round,\\r\\nand a man behind each of them, and as a gentleman, carrying a number of\\r\\npapers, passed her, she stopped him and said, timidly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, Monsieur, but can you tell me where I must apply for\\r\\npayment for anything that has been accidentally burnt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a sonorous voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first door on the left; that is the department you want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis frightened her still more, and she felt inclined to run away, to\\r\\nmake no claim, to sacrifice her eighteen francs. But the idea of that\\r\\nsum revived her courage, and she went upstairs, out of breath, stopping\\r\\nat almost every other step.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knocked at a door which she saw on the first landing, and a clear\\r\\nvoice said, in answer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three\\r\\nsolemn gentlemen, all with a decoration in their buttonholes, were\\r\\nstanding talking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them asked her: \"What do you want, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly get out her words, but stammered: \"I have come--I have\\r\\ncome on account of an accident, something--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe very politely pointed out a seat to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will kindly sit down I will attend to you in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, returning to the other two, he went on with the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Company, gentlemen, does not consider that it is under any\\r\\nobligation to you for more than four hundred thousand francs, and we can\\r\\npay no attention to your claim to the further sum of a hundred thousand,\\r\\nwhich you wish to make us pay. Besides that, the surveyor\\'s valuation--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the others interrupted him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite enough, Monsieur; the Law Courts will decide between us,\\r\\nand we have nothing further to do than to take your leave.\" And they\\r\\nwent out after mutual ceremonious bows.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If she could only have gone away with them, how gladly she would\\r\\nhave done it; she would have run away and given up everything. But it\\r\\nwas too late, for the gentleman came back, and said, bowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for you, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could scarcely speak, but at last she managed to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come--for this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager looked at the object which she held out to him in mute\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith trembling fingers she tried to undo the elastic, and succeeded,\\r\\nafter several attempts, and hastily opened the damaged remains of the\\r\\numbrella.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks to me to be in a very bad state of health,\" he said,\\r\\ncompassionately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It cost me twenty francs,\" she said, with some hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished. \"Really! As much as that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was a capital article, and I wanted you to see the state it is\\r\\nin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, I see; very well. But I really do not understand what it can\\r\\nhave to do with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this Company did not pay for\\r\\nsuch small articles, and she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--it is burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not deny it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that very well,\" he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained open-mouthed, not knowing what to say next; then suddenly\\r\\nforgetting that she had left out the main thing, she said hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Mme. Oreille; we are assured in _La Maternelle_, and I have come\\r\\nto claim the value of this damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to have it re-covered,\" she added quickly, fearing a\\r\\npositive refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager was rather embarrassed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, really, Madame, we do not sell umbrellas; we cannot undertake such\\r\\nkinds of repairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little woman felt her courage reviving; she was not going to give up\\r\\nwithout a struggle; she was not even afraid any more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to pay me the cost of repairing it; I can quite well\\r\\nget it done myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman seemed rather confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Madame, it is such a very small matter! We are never asked to\\r\\ngive compensation for such trivial losses. You must allow that we cannot\\r\\nmake good pocket-handkerchiefs, gloves, brooms, slippers, all the small\\r\\narticles which are every day exposed to the chances of being burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red, and felt inclined to fly into a rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Monsieur, last December one of our chimneys caught fire, and\\r\\ncaused at least five hundred francs\\' damage; M. Oreille made no claim on\\r\\nthe Company, and so it is only just that it should pay for my umbrella\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager, guessing that she was telling a lie, said, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must acknowledge, Madame, that it is very surprising that M.\\r\\nOreille should have asked no compensation for damages amounting to five\\r\\nhundred francs, and should now claim five or six francs for mending an\\r\\numbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not the least put out, and replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg pardon, Monsieur, the five hundred francs affected M. Oreille\\'s\\r\\npocket, whereas this damage, amounting to eighteen francs, concerns Mme.\\r\\nOreille\\'s pocket only, which is a totally different matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he saw that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would\\r\\nonly be wasting his time, he said, resignedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you kindly tell me how the damage was done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt that she had won the victory, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is how it happened, Monsieur: In our hall there is a bronze\\r\\nstick-and umbrella-stand, and the other day, when I came in, I put my\\r\\numbrella into it. I must tell you that just above there is a shelf for\\r\\nthe candlesticks and matches. I put out my hand, took three or four\\r\\nmatches, and struck one, but it missed fire, so I struck another, which\\r\\nignited, but went out immediately, and a third did the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager interrupted her, to make a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose they were Government matches, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not understand him, and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely. At any rate, the fourth caught fire, and I lit my candle,\\r\\nand went into my room to go to bed; but in a quarter-of-an-hour I\\r\\nfancied that I smelt something burning, and I have always been terribly\\r\\nafraid of fire. If ever we have an accident it will not be my fault, I\\r\\nassure you. I am terribly nervous since our chimney was on fire, as I\\r\\ntold you; so I got up, and hunted about everywhere, sniffing like a dog\\r\\nafter game, and at last I noticed that my umbrella was burning. Most\\r\\nlikely a match had fallen between the folds and burnt it. You can see\\r\\nhow it has damaged it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager had taken his clue, and asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you estimate the damage at?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not know what to say, as she was not certain what amount to put\\r\\non it, but at last she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you had better get it done yourself. I will leave it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, naturally refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Madame, I cannot do that. Tell me the amount of your claim, that is\\r\\nall I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!--I think that--Look here, Monsieur, I do not want to make any\\r\\nmoney out of you, so I will tell you what we will do. I will take my\\r\\numbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it in good, durable silk, and\\r\\nI will bring the bill to you. Will that suit you, Monsieur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly, Madame; we will settle it so. Here is a note for the\\r\\ncashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave Mme. Oreille a slip of paper, who took it, got up and went out,\\r\\nthanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good\\r\\numbrella-maker, and when she found a shop which appeared to be a first\\r\\nclass one, she went in, and said, confidently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want this umbrella recovered in silk, good silk. Use the very best\\r\\nand strongest you have; I don\\'t mind what it costs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY UNCLE SOSTHENES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Uncle Sosthenes was a Freethinker, like so many others are, from pure\\r\\nstupidity; people are very often religious in the same way. The mere\\r\\nsight of a priest threw him into a violent rage; he shook his fist and\\r\\ngrimaced at him, and touched a piece of iron when the priest\\'s back was\\r\\nturned, forgetting that the latter action showed a belief after all, the\\r\\nbelief in the evil eye. Now when beliefs are unreasonable one should\\r\\nhave all or none at all. I myself am a Freethinker; I revolt at all the\\r\\ndogmas which have invented the fear of death, but I feel no anger\\r\\ntowards places of worship, be they Catholic, Apostolic, Roman,\\r\\nProtestant, Greek, Russian, Buddhist, Jewish, or Mohammedan. I have a\\r\\npeculiar manner of looking at them and explaining them. A place of\\r\\nworship represents the homage paid by man to THE UNKNOWN. The more\\r\\nextended our thoughts and our views become, the more _the unknown_\\r\\ndiminishes, and the more places of worship will decay. I, however, in\\r\\nthe place of church furniture, in the place of pulpits, reading desks,\\r\\naltars, and so on, would fit them up with telescopes, microscopes, and\\r\\nelectrical machines; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and I differed on nearly every point. He was a patriot, while I\\r\\nwas not, for after all patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg\\r\\nfrom which wars are hatched.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was a Freemason, and I used to declare that they are stupider\\r\\nthan old women devotees. That is my opinion, and I maintain it; if we\\r\\nmust have any religion at all the old one is good enough for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is their object? Mutual help to be obtained by tickling the palms\\r\\nof each other\\'s hands. I see no harm in it, for they put into practice\\r\\nthe Christian precept: \"Do unto others as ye would they should do unto\\r\\nyou.\" The only difference consists in the tickling, but it does not seem\\r\\nworth while to make such a fuss about lending a poor devil half-a-crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all my arguments my uncle\\'s reply used to be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are raising up a religion against a religion; Freethought will kill\\r\\nclericalism. Freemasonry is the headquarters of those who are\\r\\ndemolishing all deities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear uncle,\" I would reply (in my heart I felt inclined\\r\\nto say, \"You old idiot!\"); \"it is just that which I am blaming you for.\\r\\nInstead of destroying, you are organizing competition; it is only a case\\r\\nof lowering the prices. And then, if you only admitted Freethinkers\\r\\namong you I could understand it, but you admit anybody. You have a\\r\\nnumber of Catholics among you, even the leaders of the party. Pius IX.\\r\\nis said to have been one of you before he became Pope. If you call a\\r\\nsociety with such an organization a bulwark against clericalism, I think\\r\\nit is an extremely weak one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" my uncle would reply, with a wink, \"our most formidable\\r\\nactions are political; slowly and surely we are everywhere undermining\\r\\nthe monarchical spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I broke out: \"Yes, you are very clever! If you tell me that\\r\\nFreemasonry is an election-machine, I will grant it you. I will never\\r\\ndeny that it is used as a machine to control stove for candidates of\\r\\nall shades; if you say that it is only used to hoodwink people, to drill\\r\\nthem to go to the voting-urn as soldiers are sent under fire, I agree\\r\\nwith you; if you declare that it is indispensable to all political\\r\\nambitions because it changes all its members into electoral agents, I\\r\\nshould say to you, \\'That is as clear as the sun.\\' But when you tell me\\r\\nthat it serves to undermine the monarchical spirit, I can only laugh in\\r\\nyour face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just consider that vast and democratic association which had Prince\\r\\nNapoleon for its Grand Master under the Empire; which has the Crown\\r\\nPrince for its Grand Master in Germany, the Czar\\'s brother in Russia,\\r\\nand to which the Prince of Wales and King Humbert and nearly all the\\r\\nroyalists of the globe belong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right,\" my uncle said; \"but all these persons are serving\\r\\nour projects without guessing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt inclined to tell him he was talking a pack of nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, however, indeed a sight to see my uncle when he had a Freemason\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn meeting they shook hands in a manner that was irresistibly funny; one\\r\\ncould see that they were going through a series of secret mysterious\\r\\npressures. When I wished to put my uncle in a rage, I had only to tell\\r\\nhim that dogs also have a manner which savors very much of Freemasonry,\\r\\nwhen they greet one another on meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen my uncle would take his friend into a corner to tell him something\\r\\nimportant, and at dinner they had a peculiar way of looking at each\\r\\nother, and of drinking to each other, in a manner as if to say: \"We know\\r\\nall about it, don\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to think that there are millions on the face of the globe who are\\r\\namused at such monkey tricks! I would sooner be a Jesuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in our town there really was an old Jesuit who was my uncle\\'s\\r\\ndetestation. Every time he met him, or if he only saw him at a distance,\\r\\nhe used to say: \"Go on, you toad!\" And then, taking my arm, he would\\r\\nwhisper to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, that fellow will play me a trick some day or other, I feel\\r\\nsure of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle spoke quite truly, and this was how it happened and through my\\r\\nfault also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a\\r\\ndinner on Good Friday, a real dinner with his favorite chitterlings and\\r\\nblackpuddings. I resisted as much as I could, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall eat meat on that day, but at home, quite by myself. Your\\r\\n_manifestation_, as you call it, is an idiotic idea. Why should you\\r\\nmanifest? What does it matter to you if people do not eat any meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my uncle would not be persuaded. He asked three of his friends to\\r\\ndine with him at one of the best restaurants in the town, and as he was\\r\\ngoing to pay the bill, I had certainly, after all, no scruples about\\r\\n_manifesting_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt four o\\'clock we took a conspicuous place in the most frequented\\r\\nrestaurant in the town, and my uncle ordered dinner in a loud voice for\\r\\nsix o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat down punctually, and at ten o\\'clock he had not finished yet. Five\\r\\nof us had drunk eighteen bottles of fine still wines, and four of\\r\\nchampagne. Then my uncle proposed what he was in the habit of calling:\\r\\n\"The archbishop\\'s turn.\" Each man put six small glasses in front of him,\\r\\neach of them filled with a different liquor, and then they had all to be\\r\\nemptied at one gulp, one after another, while one of the waiters counted\\r\\ntwenty. It was very stupid, but my uncle thought it was very suitable to\\r\\nthe occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven o\\'clock he was as drunk as a fly. So we had to take him home\\r\\nin a cab and put him to bed, and one could easily foresee that his\\r\\nanti-clerical demonstration would end in a terrible fit of indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was going back to my lodgings, being rather drunk myself, with a\\r\\ncheerful Machiavelian drunkenness which quite satisfied all my instincts\\r\\nof skepticism, an idea struck me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI arranged my necktie, put on a look of great distress, and went and\\r\\nrang loudly at the old Jesuit\\'s door. As he was deaf he made me wait a\\r\\nlong while, but at length he appeared at his window in a cotton nightcap\\r\\nand asked what I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shouted out at the top of my voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make haste, reverend Sir, and open the door; a poor, despairing, sick\\r\\nman is in need of your spiritual ministrations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good, kind man put on his trousers as quickly as he could, and came\\r\\ndown without his cassock. I told him in a breathless voice that my\\r\\nuncle, the Freethinker, had been taken suddenly ill, and fearing it was\\r\\ngoing to be something serious he had been seized with a sudden fear of\\r\\ndeath, and wished to see him and talk to him; to have his advice and\\r\\ncomfort, to make his peace with the Church, and to confess, so as to be\\r\\nable to cross the dreaded threshold at peace with himself; and I added\\r\\nin a mocking tone:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate he wishes it, and if it does him no good it can do him no\\r\\nharm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Jesuit, who was startled, delighted, and almost trembling, said\\r\\nto me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a moment, my son, I will come with you;\" but I replied: \"Pardon\\r\\nme, reverend Father, if I do not go with you; but my convictions will\\r\\nnot allow me to do so. I even refused to come and fetch you; so I beg\\r\\nyou not to say that you have seen me, but to declare that you had a\\r\\npresentiment--a sort of revelation of his illness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest consented, and went off quickly, knocked at my uncle\\'s door,\\r\\nand was soon let in; and I saw the black cassock disappear within that\\r\\nstronghold of Freethought.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hid under a neighboring gateway to wait for events. Had he been well,\\r\\nmy uncle would have half-murdered the Jesuit, but I knew that he would\\r\\nscarcely be able to move an arm, and I asked myself, gleefully, what\\r\\nsort of a scene would take place between these antagonists, what\\r\\nexplanation would be given? and what would be the issue of the situation\\r\\nwhich my uncle\\'s indignation would render more tragic still?\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed till I had to hold my sides, and said to myself, half aloud:\\r\\n\"Oh! what a joke, what a joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile it was getting very cold, and I noticed that the Jesuit stayed\\r\\na long time, and thought: \"They are having an explanation, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, two, three hours passed, and still the reverend Father did not come\\r\\nout. What had happened? Had my uncle died in a fit when he saw him, or\\r\\nhad he killed the cassocked gentleman? Perhaps they had mutually\\r\\ndevoured each other? This last supposition appeared very unlikely, for\\r\\nI fancied that my uncle was quite incapable of swallowing a grain more\\r\\nnourishment at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the day broke.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very uneasy, and, not venturing to go into the house myself, I\\r\\nwent to one of my friends who lived opposite. I knocked him up,\\r\\nexplained matters to him, much to his amusement and astonishment, and\\r\\ntook possession of his window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine o\\'clock he relieved me, and I got a little sleep. At two o\\'clock\\r\\nI, in my turn, replaced him. We were utterly astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six o\\'clock the Jesuit left, with a very happy and satisfied look on\\r\\nhis face, and we saw him go away with a quiet step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, timid and ashamed, I went and knocked at my uncle\\'s door; and when\\r\\nthe servant opened it I did not dare to ask her any questions, but went\\r\\nupstairs without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was lying pale, exhausted, with weary, sorrowful eyes and heavy\\r\\narms, on his bed. A little religious picture was fastened to one of the\\r\\nbed-curtains with a pin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, uncle,\" I said, \"you in bed still? Are you not well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a feeble voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear boy, I have been very ill, nearly dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was that, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know; it was most surprising. But, what is stranger still is,\\r\\nthat the Jesuit priest who has just left--you know, that excellent man\\r\\nwhom I have made such fun of--had a divine revelation of my state, and\\r\\ncame to see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, and with\\r\\ndifficulty said: \"Oh, really!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he came. He heard a Voice telling him to get up and come to me,\\r\\nbecause I was going to die. It was a revelation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pretended to sneeze, so as not to burst out laughing; I felt inclined\\r\\nto roll on the ground with amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about a minute I managed to say, indignantly: \"And you received him,\\r\\nuncle, you? You, a Freethinker, a Freemason? You did not have him thrown\\r\\nout-of-doors?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen a moment, it is so astonishing--so astonishing and providential!\\r\\nHe also spoke to me about my father; it seems he knew him formerly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father, uncle? But that is no reason for receiving a Jesuit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that, but I was very ill, and he looked after me most devotedly\\r\\nall night long. He was perfect; no doubt he saved my life; those men are\\r\\nall a little bit of a doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! he looked after you all night? But you said just now that he had\\r\\nonly been gone a very short time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite true; I kept him to breakfast after all his kindness. He\\r\\nhad it at a table by my bedside while I drank a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he ate meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle looked vexed, as if I had said something very much out of\\r\\nplace, and then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t joke, Gaston; such things are out of place at times. He has shown\\r\\nme more devotion than many a relation would have done, and I expect to\\r\\nhave his convictions respected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather upset me, but I answered, nevertheless: \"Very well, uncle;\\r\\nand what did you do after breakfast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We played a game of bezique, and then he repeated his breviary while I\\r\\nread a little book which he happened to have in his pocket, and which\\r\\nwas not by any means badly written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A religious book, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and no, or rather--no. It is the history of their missions in\\r\\nCentral Africa, and is rather a book of travels and adventures. What\\r\\nthese men have done is very grand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to feel that matters were going badly, so I got up. \"Well,\\r\\ngood-bye, uncle,\" I said, \"I see you are going to leave Freemasonry for\\r\\nreligion; you are a renegade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still rather confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but religion is a sort of Freemasonry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When is your Jesuit coming back?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t--I don\\'t know exactly; to-morrow, perhaps; but it is not\\r\\ncertain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out, altogether overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy joke turned out very badly for me! My uncle became radically\\r\\nconverted, and if that had been all I should not have cared so much.\\r\\nClerical or Freemason, to me it is all the same; six of one and\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen of the other; but the worst of it is that he has just made\\r\\nhis will--yes, made his will--and he has disinherited me in favor of\\r\\nthat rascally Jesuit!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHE?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear friend, you cannot understand it by any possible means, you say,\\r\\nand I perfectly believe you. You think I am going mad? It may be so, but\\r\\nnot for the reasons which you suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I am going to get married, and I will give you what has led me to\\r\\ntake that step.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy ideas and my convictions have not changed at all. I look upon all\\r\\nlegalized cohabitation as utterly stupid, for I am certain that nine\\r\\nhusbands out of ten are cuckolds; and they get no more than their\\r\\ndeserts for having been idiotic enough to fetter their lives, and\\r\\nrenounce their freedom in love, the only happy and good thing in the\\r\\nworld, and for having clipped the wings of fancy, which continually\\r\\ndrives us on towards all women, &c., &c., &c. You know what I mean. More\\r\\nthan ever I feel that I am incapable of loving one woman alone, because\\r\\nI shall always adore all the others too much. I should like to have a\\r\\nthousand arms, a thousand mouths, and a thousand--_temperaments_, to be\\r\\nable to strain an army of these charming creatures in my embrace at the\\r\\nsame moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet I am going to get married!\\r\\n\\r\\nI may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my\\r\\nwife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that\\r\\nthere is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my\\r\\npurpose. She is small, fair, and stout; so of course the day after\\r\\nto-morrow I shall ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is not rich, and belongs to the middle-classes. She is a girl such\\r\\nas you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any\\r\\napparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say\\r\\nof her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,\" and to-morrow they will say: \"What\\r\\na very nice woman Madame Raymon is.\" She belongs, in a word, to that\\r\\nimmense number of girls whom one is glad to have for one\\'s wife till the\\r\\nmoment comes, when one discovers that one happens to prefer all the\\r\\nother women to that particular woman whom one has married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" you will say to me, \"what on earth did you get married for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason\\r\\nthat urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am\\r\\nfrightened of being alone!\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state\\r\\nof mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not want to be alone any longer at night; I want to feel that there\\r\\nis someone close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say\\r\\nsomething, no matter what it be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able\\r\\nto ask some sudden question, a stupid question even if I feel inclined,\\r\\nso that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking\\r\\nsoul close to me, someone whose reason is at work; so that when I\\r\\nhastily light the candle I may see some human face by my\\r\\nside--because--because--I am ashamed to confess it--because I am afraid\\r\\nof being alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! you don\\'t understand me yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room I\\r\\nshould kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I\\r\\nbelieve in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I\\r\\nbelieve in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from\\r\\nthe face of this earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell,--yes, well, it must be told; I am afraid of myself, afraid of that\\r\\nhorrible sensation of incomprehensible fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I\\r\\nam afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects, which\\r\\nare animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above\\r\\nall, I am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems\\r\\nas if it were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and\\r\\ninvisible agony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind which causes a cold shiver\\r\\nto run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be seen,\\r\\nand I wish there were something there, no matter what, as long as it\\r\\nwere something tangible: I am frightened, merely because I cannot\\r\\nunderstand my own terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I\\r\\nknow not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or\\r\\nunder my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and\\r\\nI turn round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although\\r\\nthere is nothing there, and I know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get agitated; I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself up\\r\\nin my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes, and there,\\r\\ncowering down rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and remain\\r\\nthus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight on the\\r\\ntable by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet--I dare not\\r\\ndo it!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly I felt nothing of all that; I came home quite comfortably, and\\r\\nwent up and down in my rooms without anything disturbing my calmness of\\r\\nmind. Had anyone told me that I should be attacked by a malady--for I\\r\\ncan call it nothing else--of most improbable fear, such a stupid and\\r\\nterrible malady as it is, I should have laughed outright. I was\\r\\ncertainly never afraid of opening the door in the dark; I went to bed\\r\\nslowly without locking it, and never got up in the middle of the night\\r\\nto make sure that everything was firmly closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began last year in a very strange manner, on a damp autumn evening.\\r\\nWhen my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself\\r\\nwhat I was going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time,\\r\\nfeeling tired without any reason for it, unable to work, and even\\r\\nwithout energy to read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a\\r\\nprey to one of those fits of despondency, without any apparent cause\\r\\nwhich makes us feel inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so\\r\\nas to shake off our depressing thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than\\r\\nthey had ever done before, while I was surrounded by a sensation of\\r\\ninfinite and overwhelming solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but\\r\\nthen a kind of nervous impatience agitated my legs, so I got up and\\r\\nbegan to walk about again. I was rather feverish, for my hands, which I\\r\\nhad clasped behind me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost\\r\\nseemed to burn one another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my\\r\\nback, and I thought the damp air might have penetrated into my room, so\\r\\nI lit the fire for the first time that year, and sat down again and\\r\\nlooked at the flames. But soon I felt that I could not possibly remain\\r\\nquiet, and so I got up again and determined to go out, to pull myself\\r\\ntogether, and to find a friend to bear me company.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not find anyone, so I went on to the boulevards to try and meet\\r\\nsome acquaintance or other there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the\\r\\ngaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay\\r\\nheavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light from the lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on slowly, saying to myself, \"I shall not find a soul to talk\\r\\nto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced into several cafés, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg\\r\\nPoissonière, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the\\r\\ntables, who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the\\r\\nrefreshments they had ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I\\r\\nstarted off for home; I was very calm and very tired. My concierge[9]\\r\\nopened the door at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought\\r\\nthat another lodger had no doubt just come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it\\r\\nmerely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had\\r\\nbeen brought up for me in the course of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, and found my fire still burning, so that it lighted up the\\r\\nroom a little, and, in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed somebody\\r\\nsitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his back\\r\\ntowards me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought very naturally\\r\\nthat some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, whom\\r\\nI had told when I went out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I\\r\\nremembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had\\r\\nbeen opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched, and not\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone\\r\\nto sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw\\r\\nhim quite clearly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were\\r\\ncrossed, while his head, which was somewhat inclined to the left of the\\r\\narmchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. \"Who can it be?\" I\\r\\nasked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather dark, so I\\r\\nput out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in contact\\r\\nwith the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if some\\r\\nterrible danger had suddenly appeared in my way; then I turned round\\r\\nagain, impelled by some imperious desire of looking at the armchair\\r\\nagain, and I remained standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that\\r\\nI could not collect my thoughts, and ready to drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: \"It is a mere\\r\\nhallucination, that is all,\" and I immediately began to reflect about\\r\\nthis phenomenon. Thoughts fly very quickly at such moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been suffering from a hallucination, that was an incontestable\\r\\nfact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and\\r\\nlogically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only\\r\\nmy eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those\\r\\nvisions which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous\\r\\naccident to the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather\\r\\ncongested, perhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in so doing, I\\r\\nnoticed that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if\\r\\nsomebody had touched me from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly not by any means quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I double-locked my door, and felt rather reassured; now, at any\\r\\nrate, nobody could come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down again, and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I\\r\\nwent to bed, and blew out my light.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but then an\\r\\nirresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned on to\\r\\nmy side.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light\\r\\non to the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken, for there was nothing\\r\\nthere; I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to\\r\\nget to sleep as the room was now dark, but I had not forgotten myself\\r\\nfor more than five minutes when in my dream I saw all the scene which I\\r\\nhad witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up with a start,\\r\\nand having lit the candle, I sat up in bed, without venturing even to\\r\\ntry and go to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself,\\r\\nand twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad;\\r\\nwhen day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept\\r\\npeacefully till noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare; I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what. I had been ill, in a word, but yet I thought that I was\\r\\na great fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening; I went and dined at a\\r\\nrestaurant; afterwards I went to the theater, and then started home. But\\r\\nas I got near the house I was seized by a strange feeling of uneasiness\\r\\nonce more; I was afraid of _seeing_ him again. I was not afraid of him,\\r\\nnot afraid of his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid\\r\\nof being deceived again; I was afraid of some fresh hallucination,\\r\\nafraid lest fear should take possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then I\\r\\nthought that I was really too foolish, and at last I returned home. I\\r\\npanted so that I could scarcely get upstairs, and I remained standing\\r\\noutside my door for more than ten minutes; then suddenly I took courage,\\r\\nand screwed myself together. I inserted my key into the lock, and went\\r\\nin with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my half-open bedroom door,\\r\\nand gave a frightened look towards the fireplace; there was nothing\\r\\nthere. A--h!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a relief and what a delight! What a deliverance! I walked up and\\r\\ndown briskly and boldly, but I was not altogether reassured, and kept\\r\\nturning round with a jump; the very shadows in the corner disquieted me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but I\\r\\ndid not see _him_; no, that was all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that\\r\\nthe specter is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to\\r\\nme again. And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not\\r\\nbelieve in it, and know that it is nothing?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt still worries me, however, because I am constantly thinking of it:\\r\\n_his right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man\\r\\nwho was asleep_.... Enough of that, in Heaven\\'s name! I don\\'t want to\\r\\nthink about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, however, am I so persistently possessed with this idea? His feet\\r\\nwere close to the fire!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe haunts me; it is very stupid, but so it is. Who and what is HE? I\\r\\nknow that he does not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my\\r\\nfears, and in my agony! There--enough of that!...\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, _to stiffen\\r\\nmyself_, so to say; but I cannot remain at home, because I know he is\\r\\nthere. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again;\\r\\nthat is all over. But he is there all the same in my thoughts. He\\r\\nremains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is\\r\\nbehind the doors, in the closed cupboards, in the wardrobe, under the\\r\\nbed, in every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take\\r\\nthe candle to look under the bed and throw a light on to the dark\\r\\nplaces, he is there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn\\r\\nround, certain that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him\\r\\nagain; but he is, for all that, none the less behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very stupid, it is dreadful; but what am I to do? I cannot help\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if there were two of us in the place, I feel certain that he would\\r\\nnot be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone; simply\\r\\nand solely because I am alone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA PHILOSOPHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot had been my most intimate friend from childhood; we had no\\r\\nsecrets from each other, and were united heart and soul by a brotherly\\r\\nintimacy and a boundless confidence in each other, and I had been\\r\\nintrusted with the secret of all his love affairs, as he had been with\\r\\nmine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he told me that he was going to get married I was hurt, just as if\\r\\nhe had been guilty of a treacherous act with regard to me. I felt that\\r\\nit must interfere with that cordial and absolute affection which had\\r\\nunited us hitherto. His wife would come between us. The intimacy of the\\r\\nmarriage-bed establishes a kind of complicity of mysterious alliance\\r\\nbetween two persons, even when they have ceased to love each other. Man\\r\\nand wife are like two discreet partners who will not let anyone else\\r\\ninto their secrets. But that close bond which the conjugal kiss fastens\\r\\nis widely loosened on the day on which the woman takes a lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember Blérot\\'s wedding as if it were but yesterday. I would not be\\r\\npresent at the signing of the marriage contract, as I have no particular\\r\\nliking for such ceremonies, but I only went to the civil wedding and to\\r\\nthe church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife, whom I had never seen before, was a tall, slight girl, with\\r\\npale hair, pale cheeks, pale hands, and eyes to match. She walked with a\\r\\nslightly undulating motion, as if she were on board a ship, and seemed\\r\\nto advance with a succession of long, graceful curtsies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot seemed very much in love with her. He looked at her constantly,\\r\\nand I felt a shiver of an immoderate desire for her pass through my\\r\\nframe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to see him in a few days, and he said to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not know how happy I am; I am madly in love with her; but then\\r\\nshe is ... she is ...\" He did not finish his sentence, but he put the\\r\\ntips of his fingers to his lips with a gesture which signified:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Divine! delicious! perfect!\" and a good deal more besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked, laughing, \"What! all that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything that you can imagine,\" was his answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe introduced me to her. She was very pleasant, on easy terms with me,\\r\\nas was natural, and begged me to look upon their house as my own. I felt\\r\\nthat he, Blérot, did not belong to me any longer. Our intimacy was\\r\\naltogether checked, and we hardly found a word to say to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon took my leave, and shortly afterwards went to the East, and\\r\\nreturned by way of Russia, Germany, Sweden, and Holland, after an\\r\\nabsence of eighteen months from Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after my arrival, as I was walking along the boulevards to\\r\\nbreathe the air once more, I saw a pale man with sunken cheeks coming\\r\\ntowards me, who was as much like Blérot as it was possible for a\\r\\nphysically emaciated man to be to a strong, ruddy, rather stout man. I\\r\\nlooked at him in surprise, and asked myself: \"Can it possibly be he?\"\\r\\nBut he saw me, and came towards me with outstretched arms, and we\\r\\nembraced in the middle of the boulevard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had gone up and down once or twice from the Rue Druot to the\\r\\nVaudeville Theater, just as we were taking leave of each other--for he\\r\\nalready seemed quite done up with walking--I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t look at all well. Are you ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do feel rather out of sorts,\" was all he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked like a man who was going to die, and I felt a flood of\\r\\naffection for my old friend, the only real one that I had ever had. I\\r\\nsqueezed his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you? Are you in pain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little tired; but it is nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does your doctor say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He calls it anæmia, and has ordered me to eat no white meat and to take\\r\\ntincture of iron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA suspicion flashed across me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you happy?\" I asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very happy; my wife is charming, and I love her more than ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I noticed that he grew rather red and seemed embarrassed, as if he\\r\\nwas afraid of any further questions, so I took him by the arm and pushed\\r\\nhim into a café, which was nearly empty at that time of day. I forced\\r\\nhim to sit down, and looking him straight in the face, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, old fellow, just tell me the exact truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing to tell you,\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not true,\" I replied firmly. \"You are ill, mentally perhaps,\\r\\nand you dare not reveal your secret to anyone. Something or other is\\r\\ndoing you harm, and I mean you to tell me what it is. Come, I am waiting\\r\\nfor you to begin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he got very red, stammered, and turning his head away, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very idiotic--but I--I am done for!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he did not go on, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I have got a wife who is killing me, that is all,\" he said\\r\\nabruptly, almost desperately.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not understand at first. \"Does she make you unhappy? How? What is\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he replied in a low voice, as if he were confessing some crime; \"I\\r\\nlove her too much, that is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thunderstruck at this brutal avowal, and then I felt inclined to\\r\\nlaugh, but at length I managed to reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, at least so it seems to me, you might manage to--to love\\r\\nher a little less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had got very pale again, and at length made up his mind to speak to\\r\\nme openly, as he used to do formerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"that is impossible; and I am dying from it I know; it is\\r\\nkilling me, and I am really frightened. Some days, like to-day, I feel\\r\\ninclined to leave her, to go away altogether, to start for the other end\\r\\nof the world, so as to live for a long time; and then, when the evening\\r\\ncomes, I return home in spite of myself, but slowly, and feeling\\r\\nuncomfortable. I go upstairs hesitatingly and ring, and when I go in I\\r\\nsee her there sitting in her easy chair, and she says, \\'How late you\\r\\nare,\\' I kiss her, and we sit down to dinner. During the meal I think to\\r\\nmyself: \\'I will go directly it is over, and take the train for\\r\\nsomewhere, no matter where;\\' but when we get back to the drawing-room I\\r\\nam so tired that I have not the courage to get up out of my chair, and\\r\\nso I remain, and then--and then--I succumb again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help smiling again. He saw it, and said: \"You may laugh, but\\r\\nI assure you it is very horrible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you tell your wife?\" I asked him. \"Unless she be a regular\\r\\nmonster she would understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"It is all very well for you to talk. I don\\'t\\r\\ntell her because I know her nature. Have you ever heard it said of\\r\\ncertain women, \\'She has just married a third time?\\' Well, and that makes\\r\\nyou laugh like you did just now, and yet it is true. What is to be done?\\r\\nIt is neither her fault nor mine. She is so, because nature has made her\\r\\nso; I assure you, my dear old friend, she has the temperament of a\\r\\nMessalina. She does not know it, but I do; so much the worse for me. She\\r\\nis charming, gentle, tender, and thinks that our conjugal intercourse,\\r\\nwhich is wearing me out and killing me, is natural and quite moderate.\\r\\nShe seems like an ignorant schoolgirl, and she really is ignorant, poor\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day I form energetic resolutions, for you must understand that I\\r\\nam dying. But one look of her eyes, one of those looks in which I can\\r\\nread the ardent desire of her lips, is enough for me, and I succumb at\\r\\nonce, saying to myself: \\'This is really the end; I will have no more of\\r\\nher death-giving kisses,\\' and then, when I have yielded again, like I\\r\\nhave to-day, I go out and walk on ahead, thinking of death, and saying\\r\\nto myself that I am lost, that all is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so mentally ill that I went for a walk to Père Lachaise cemetery\\r\\nyesterday. I looked at all the graves, standing in a row like dominoes,\\r\\nand I thought to myself: \\'I shall soon be there,\\' and then I returned\\r\\nhome, quite determined to pretend to be ill, and so escape, but I could\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! You don\\'t know what it is. Ask a smoker who is poisoning himself\\r\\nwith nicotine whether he can give up his delicious and deadly habit. He\\r\\nwill tell you that he has tried a hundred times without success, and he\\r\\nwill, perhaps, add: \\'So much the worse, but I had rather die than go\\r\\nwithout tobacco.\\' That is just the case with me. When once one is in the\\r\\nclutches of such a passion or such a vice, one must give oneself up to\\r\\nit entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and gave me his hand. I felt seized with a tumult of rage, and\\r\\nwith hatred for this woman, this careless, charming, terrible woman; and\\r\\nas he was buttoning up his coat to go out I said to him, brutally\\r\\nperhaps:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, in God\\'s name, why don\\'t you let her have a lover, rather than\\r\\nkill yourself like that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders without replying, and went off.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor six months I did not see him. Every morning I expected a letter of\\r\\ninvitation to his funeral, but I would not go to his house from a\\r\\ncomplicated feeling of contempt for him and for that woman; of anger, of\\r\\nindignation, of a thousand sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely spring morning I was walking in the Champs Elysées. It was\\r\\none of those warm days which makes our eyes bright and stir up in us a\\r\\ntumultuous feeling of happiness from the mere sense of existence.\\r\\nSomeone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I saw my old\\r\\nfriend, looking well, stout and rosy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me both hands, beaming with pleasure, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are, you erratic individual!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him, utterly thunderstruck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on my word--yes. By Jove! I congratulate you; you have indeed\\r\\nchanged in the last six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flushed scarlet, and said, with an embarrassed laugh:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One can but do one\\'s best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him so obstinately that he evidently felt uncomfortable, so\\r\\nI went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So--now--you are--completely cured?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stammered, hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, perfectly, thank you.\" Then changing his tone, \"How lucky that I\\r\\nshould have come across you, old fellow. I hope we shall often meet\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I would not give up my idea; I wanted to know how matters really\\r\\nstood, so I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you remember what you told me six months ago? I\\r\\nsuppose--I--eh--suppose you resist now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t talk any more about it,\" he replied, uneasily; \"forget\\r\\nthat I mentioned it to you; leave me alone. But, you know, I have no\\r\\nintention of letting you go; you must come and dine at my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden fancy took me to see for myself how matters stood, so that I\\r\\nmight understand all about it, and I accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife received me in a most charming manner, and she was, as a matter\\r\\nof fact, a most attractive woman. Her long hands, her neck and cheeks\\r\\nwere beautifully white and delicate, and marked her breeding, and her\\r\\nwalk was undulating and delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené gave her a brotherly kiss on the forehead and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has not Lucien come yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" she replied, in a clear, soft voice; \"you know he is almost\\r\\nalways rather late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the bell rang, and a tall man was shown in. He was dark,\\r\\nwith a thick beard, and looked like a modern Hercules. We were\\r\\nintroduced to each other; his name was Lucien Delabarre.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené and he shook hands in a most friendly manner, and then we went to\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a most enjoyable meal, without the least constraint. My old\\r\\nfriend spoke with me constantly, in the old familiar cordial manner,\\r\\njust as he used to do. It was: \"You know, old fellow!\"--\"I say, old\\r\\nfellow!\"--\"Just listen a moment, old fellow!\" Suddenly he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know how glad I am to see you again; it takes me back to old\\r\\ntimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at his wife and the other man. Their attitude was perfectly\\r\\ncorrect, though I fancied once or twice that they exchanged a rapid and\\r\\nfurtive look.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as dinner was over René turned to his wife, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, I have just met Pierre again, and I am going to carry him off\\r\\nfor a walk and a chat along the boulevards to remind us of old times. I\\r\\nam leaving you in very good company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman smiled, and said to me, as she shook hands with me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep him too long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we went along, arm-in-arm, I could not help saying to him, for I was\\r\\ndetermined to know how matters stood:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, what has happened? Do tell me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, interrupted me roughly, and answered like a man who has\\r\\nbeen disturbed without any reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look here, old fellow leave one alone with your questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he added, half aloud, as if talking to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, it would have been too stupid to have let oneself go to pot\\r\\nlike that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not press him. We walked on quickly and began to talk. All of a\\r\\nsudden he whispered in my ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, suppose we go and have a bottle of \\'fizz\\' with some girls! Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not prevent myself from laughing heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you like; come along, let us go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALWAYS LOCK THE DOOR!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four glasses which were standing in front of the diners were now\\r\\nstill nearly half full, which is a sign, as a general rule, that the\\r\\nguests are quite so. They were beginning to speak without waiting for an\\r\\nanswer; no one took any notice of anything except what was going on\\r\\ninside him, either in his mind or stomach; voices grew louder, gestures\\r\\nmore animated, eyes brighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bachelors\\' dinner of confirmed old bachelors. They had\\r\\ninstituted this regular banquet twenty years before, christening it \"The\\r\\nCelibate,\" and at the time there were fourteen of them, all fully\\r\\ndetermined never to marry. Now there were only four of them left; three\\r\\nwere dead and the other seven were married.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four stuck firmly to it, and, as far as lay in their power, they\\r\\nscrupulously observed the rules which had been laid down at the\\r\\nbeginning of their curious association. They had sworn, hand-in-hand, to\\r\\nturn aside every woman they could from the right path, and their\\r\\nfriends\\' wives for choice, and more especially those of their most\\r\\nintimate friends. For this reason, as soon as any of them left the\\r\\nsociety, in order to set up in domestic life for himself, he took care\\r\\nto quarrel definitely with all his former companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this, they were pledged at every dinner to relate most minutely\\r\\ntheir last adventures, which had given rise to this familiar phrase\\r\\namongst them:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To lie like an old bachelor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey professed, moreover, the most profound contempt for woman whom they\\r\\ntalked of as an animal made solely for their pleasure. Every moment they\\r\\nquoted Schopenhauer, who was their god, and his well-known essay \"On\\r\\nWomen;\" they wished that harems and towers might be reintroduced, and\\r\\nhad the ancient maxim: \"Mulier, perpetuus infans,\"[10] woven into their\\r\\ntable-linen, and below it, the line of Alfred de Vigny\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n_La femme, enfant malade et douze fois impure._[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that by dint of despising women they lived only for them, while all\\r\\ntheir efforts and all their desires were directed towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of them who had married called them old fops, made fun of them,\\r\\nand--feared them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they began to feel the exhilarating effects of the champagne, this\\r\\nwas the moment that their old bachelor experiences began.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day in question, these old fellows, for they were old by this\\r\\ntime, and the older they got the more extraordinary _good fortune_ in\\r\\nthe way of love affairs they had to relate, were quite inexhaustible.\\r\\nFor the last month, to hear them, each of them had played the gallant\\r\\nwith at least one woman a day; and what women! the youngest, the\\r\\nnoblest, the richest, and the most beautiful!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had finished their tales, one of them, he who having spoken\\r\\nfirst had been obliged to listen to all the others, rose and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now that we have finished drawing the long-bow, I should like to tell\\r\\nyou, not my last, but my first adventure,--I mean the first adventure\\r\\nof my life, my first fall,--for it is a moral fall after all, in the\\r\\narms of Venus. Oh! I am not going to tell you my first--what shall I\\r\\ncall it?--my first appearance; certainly not. The leap over the first\\r\\nhedge (I am speaking figuratively) has nothing interesting about it. It\\r\\nis generally rather a disagreeable one, and one picks oneself up rather\\r\\nabashed, with one charming illusion the less, with a vague feeling of\\r\\ndisappointment and sadness. That _realization_ of love the first time\\r\\none experiences it is rather repugnant; we had dreamt of it as being so\\r\\ndifferent, so delicate, so refined. It leaves a physical and moral sense\\r\\nof disgust behind it, just like as when one has happened to have put\\r\\none\\'s hand into some clammy matter and feels in a hurry to _wash_ it\\r\\noff. You may _rub_ it as hard as you like, but the moral feeling\\r\\nremains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! but one very soon gets quite used to it; there is no doubt about\\r\\nthat. For my part, however, I am very sorry it was not in my power to\\r\\ngive the Creator the benefit of my advice when He was arranging these\\r\\nlittle matters. I wonder what _I_ should have done? I am not quite sure,\\r\\nbut I think with the English savant, John Stuart Mill, I should have\\r\\nmanaged differently; I should have found some more convenient and more\\r\\npoetical combination; yes--more poetical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really think that the Creator showed Himself to be too much of a\\r\\nnaturalist ... too ... what shall I say? His invention lacks poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, what I am going to tell you is about my first woman of the\\r\\nworld, the first woman in society I ever made love to;--I beg your\\r\\npardon, I ought to say the first woman of the world that ever triumphed\\r\\nover me. For at first it is _we_ who allow ourselves to be taken, while,\\r\\nlater on--well, then it is quite another matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was a friend of my mother\\'s, a charming woman in every way. When\\r\\nsuch women are chaste, it is generally from sheer stupidity, and when\\r\\nthey are in love they are furiously so. And then--_we_ are accused of\\r\\ncorrupting _them_! Yes, yes, of course! With them it is always the\\r\\nrabbit that begins and never the sportsman. I know all about it; they\\r\\ndon\\'t seem to put their fingers near us, but they do it all the same,\\r\\nand do what they like with us, without it being noticed, and then they\\r\\nactually accuse us of having ruined them, dishonored them, humiliated\\r\\nthem, and all the rest of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The woman in question certainly had a great desire to be humiliated by\\r\\nme. She may have been about thirty-five, while I was scarcely\\r\\ntwo-and-twenty. I no more thought of dishonoring her than I did of\\r\\nturning Trappist. Well, one day when I was calling on her, and while I\\r\\nwas looking at her dress with considerable astonishment, for she had on\\r\\na morning wrapper which was open as wide as a church-door when the bells\\r\\nare ringing for service, she took my hand and squeezed it--squeezed it,\\r\\nyou know, like they will do at such moments--and said, with a deep sigh,\\r\\none of those sighs, you know, which come from right down the bottom of\\r\\nthe chest: \\'Oh! don\\'t look at me like that, child!\\' I got as red as a\\r\\ntomato, and felt more nervous than usual, naturally. I was very much\\r\\ninclined to bolt, but she held my hand tightly, and putting it onto her\\r\\nwell-developed bust, she said: \\'Just feel how my heart beats!\\' Of course\\r\\nit was beating, and I began to understand what was the matter, but I\\r\\ndid not know what to do. I have changed considerably since then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I remained standing there, with one hand on the soft covering of her\\r\\nheart, while I held my hat in the other, and continuing to look at her\\r\\nwith a confused, silly smile--a timid, frightened smile--she suddenly\\r\\ndrew back, and said in an irritated voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Young man, what are you doing? You are indecent and badly brought up.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be sure I took my hand away quickly, stopped smiling, and\\r\\nstammering out some excuse, I got up and took my leave as if I had lost\\r\\nmy head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was caught, and dreamt of her. I thought her charming, adorable;\\r\\nI fancied that I loved her, that I had always loved her, and I\\r\\ndetermined to see her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I saw her again she gave me a little smile like an actress might\\r\\nbehind the scenes. Oh, how that little smile upset me! And she shook\\r\\nhands with a long, significant pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From that day it seems that I made love to her; at least, she declared\\r\\nafterwards that I had ruined her, captured her, dishonored her, with\\r\\nrare Machiavelism, with consummate cleverness, with the perseverance of\\r\\na mathematician, and the cunning of an Apaché Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But one thing troubled me strangely; where was my triumph to be\\r\\naccomplished? I lived with my family, and on this point my family was\\r\\nmost particular. I was not bold enough to venture to go to an hotel in\\r\\nbroad daylight with a woman on my arm, and I did not know whom to ask\\r\\nfor advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my fair friend had often said in joke that every young man ought\\r\\nto have a room for himself somewhere or other from home. We lived in\\r\\nParis, and this was a sort of inspiration. I took a room, and she came.\\r\\nShe came one day in November; I should have liked to put off her visit\\r\\nbecause I had no fire, and I had no fire because the chimney smoked. The\\r\\nvery evening before, I had spoken to my landlord, a retired shopkeeper,\\r\\nabout it, and he had promised that he would send for the chimneysweep in\\r\\na day or two to get it all put to rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as she came in, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There is no fire because my chimney smokes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not even appear to hear me, but stammered: \\'That does not\\r\\nmatter, I have...;\\' and when I looked surprised, she stopped short in\\r\\nconfusion, and then went on: \\'I don\\'t know what I am saying; I am\\r\\nmad.... I have lost my head.... Oh! what am I doing? Why did I come? How\\r\\nunhappy I am! What a disgrace, what a disgrace!\\' And she threw herself\\r\\nsobbing into my arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought that she really felt remorse, and swore that I would respect\\r\\nher. Then, however, she sank down at my knees, sighing: \\'But don\\'t you\\r\\nsee that I love you, that you have overcome me, that it seems as though\\r\\nyou had thrown a charm over me?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I thought it was about time to show myself a man. But she\\r\\ntrembled, got up, ran and hid behind a wardrobe, crying out: \\'Oh! don\\'t\\r\\nlook at me; no! no! If only you did not see me, if we were only in the\\r\\ndark! I am ashamed in the light. Cannot you imagine it? What a dreadful\\r\\ndream! Oh! this light, this light!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I rushed to the window; I closed the outside shutters, drew the\\r\\ncurtains, and hung a coat over a ray of light that peeped in, and then,\\r\\nstretching out my hands so as not to fall over the chairs, with my heart\\r\\nbeating, and felt for her, and found her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a fresh journey for the two of us then, groping our way, with\\r\\nour hands united, towards the other corner where the sofa stood. I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose we went straight, for first of all I knocked against the\\r\\nmantelpiece, and then against a chest of drawers, before finding what we\\r\\nwanted. After we sat down I forgot everything, and we almost went to\\r\\nsleep in each other\\'s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was half dreaming; but in my dream I fancied that someone was calling\\r\\nme and crying for help; then I received a violent blow, and opened my\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'O--h!\\' The setting sun, magnificent and red, shone full into the room\\r\\nthrough the door, which was wide open, and seemed to look at us from the\\r\\nverge of the horizon, illuminating us both, especially my companion, who\\r\\nwas screaming, struggling, and twisting, and trying with hands and feet\\r\\nto get under the sofa, while in the middle of the room stood my landlord\\r\\nby the side of the concierge[12] and a chimneysweep, as black as the\\r\\ndevil, who were looking at us with stupid eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood up in rage, ready to jump at his throat, and shouted:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What the deuce are you doing in my room?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimneysweep laughed so that he let his brush fall on the floor.\\r\\nThe porter looked as if he were going out of his mind, and the landlord\\r\\nstammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But, Monsieur, it was--it was--about the chimney--the chimney, the\\r\\nchimney which--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Go to the devil!\\' I roared. So he took off his hat, which he had kept\\r\\non in his confusion, and said, in a confused but very civil manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I beg your pardon, Monsieur; if I had known, I should not have\\r\\ndisturbed you; I should not have come. The concierge told me you had\\r\\ngone out. Pray excuse me.\\' And they all went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ever since that time I never draw the curtains but am always very\\r\\ncareful to lock the door first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA MEETING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all an accident, a pure accident. Tired of standing, Baron\\r\\nd\\'Etraille went, as all the Princess\\'s rooms were open on that\\r\\nparticular evening, into an empty bedroom, which appeared almost dark\\r\\nafter coming out of the brilliantly lighted drawing-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his\\r\\nwife would not go away before daylight. As soon as he got inside the\\r\\ndoor he saw the big bed with its azure-and-gold hangings, in the middle\\r\\nof the great room, looking like a catafalque in which love was buried,\\r\\nfor the Princess was no longer young. Behind it, a large bright spot\\r\\nlooked like a lake seen at a distance from the window. It was a large\\r\\nlooking-glass, which, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that,\\r\\nhowever, was very rarely let down, seemed to look at the bed, which was\\r\\nits accomplice. One might almost fancy that it felt regrets, and that\\r\\none was going to see in it charming shapes of naked women, and the\\r\\ngentle movement of arms about to embrace them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron stood still for a moment, smiling, rather moved, on the\\r\\nthreshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly something\\r\\nappeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had evoked\\r\\nhad risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on a low\\r\\ncouch hidden in the shade had got up, and the polished surface,\\r\\nreflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other\\r\\nbefore separating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigné. He turned and\\r\\nwent away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited till it\\r\\nwas day before taking away the Baroness; but he had no longer any\\r\\nthoughts of sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they were alone he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame, I saw you just now in Princess de Raynes\\' room; I need say no\\r\\nmore, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of\\r\\nridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without\\r\\nany scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my\\r\\norders. You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer\\r\\nunder my roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn\\r\\nyou that, should any scandal arise, I shall show myself inflexible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to speak, but he stopped her, bowed, and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly\\r\\nduring the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,\\r\\nand now he often had a caprice, either in a theater or in society,\\r\\nthough he always preserved a certain liking for the Baroness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight--too\\r\\nslight--and very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoilt,\\r\\nelegant, coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to\\r\\nsay familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My wife is charming, attractive, but--there is nothing to lay hold of.\\r\\nShe is like a glass of champagne that is all froth--when you have got to\\r\\nthe wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked up and down the room in great agitation, and thinking of a\\r\\nthousand things. At one moment he felt in a great rage, and felt\\r\\ninclined to give the Marquis a good thrashing or to smack his face\\r\\npublicly, in the club. But he thought that would not do, it would not be\\r\\nat all _the thing_; he would be laughed at, and not the Marquis, and as\\r\\nhe felt that his anger proceeded more from wounded vanity than from a\\r\\nbroken heart he went to bed, but could not go to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days afterwards it was known in Paris that the Baron and Baroness\\r\\nd\\'Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of\\r\\nincompatibility of temper. Nobody suspected anything, nobody laughed,\\r\\nand nobody was astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron, however, to avoid meeting her, traveled for a year, then he\\r\\nspent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning\\r\\nto Paris for the winter. He did not meet his wife once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not even know what people said about her. At any rate, she took\\r\\ncare to save appearances, and that was all he asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got dreadfully bored, traveled again, restored his old castle of\\r\\nVillebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he received\\r\\nrelays of friends there, till at last, tired of all these commonplace,\\r\\nso-called pleasures, he returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lills,\\r\\njust six years after their separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was then forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and\\r\\nwith that melancholy look of people who have been handsome, sought\\r\\nafter, and much liked, and who are deteriorating daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month after his return to Paris he took cold on coming out of his\\r\\nclub, and had a bad cough, so his medical man ordered him to Nice for\\r\\nthe rest of the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started by the express on Monday evening. He was late, and got to the\\r\\nstation only a very short time before the departure of the train, and\\r\\nhad barely time to get into a carriage, with only one occupant, who was\\r\\nsitting in a corner so wrapped in furs and cloaks that he could not even\\r\\nmake out whether it were a man or a woman, as nothing of the figure\\r\\ncould be seen. When he perceived that he could not find out, he put on\\r\\nhis traveling-cap, rolled himself up in his rugs, and stretched himself\\r\\nout comfortably to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not wake up till the day was breaking, and looked immediately at\\r\\nhis fellow-traveler. He had not stirred all night, and seemed still to\\r\\nbe sound asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. d\\'Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his\\r\\nbeard, and to try and freshen himself up a little generally, for a\\r\\nnight\\'s traveling changes one\\'s looks very much when one has attained to\\r\\na certain age.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great poet has said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"When we are young, our mornings are triumphant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we wake up with a cool skin, a bright eye, and glossy hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one grows older one wakes up in a very different state. Dull eyes,\\r\\nred, swollen cheeks, dry lips, the hair and beard all disarranged,\\r\\nimpart an old, fatigued, wornout look to the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron opened his traveling dressing-case, and made himself as tidy\\r\\nas he could, and then he waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engine whistled and the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No\\r\\ndoubt he was awake. They started off again, and then an oblique ray of\\r\\nsun shone into the carriage just on to the sleeper, who moved again,\\r\\nshook himself, and then calmly showed his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a young, fair, pretty, stout woman, and the Baron looked at her\\r\\nin amazement. He did not know what to believe. He could really have\\r\\nsworn that it was--his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better:\\r\\nstouter--why she had grown as stout as he was--only it suited her much\\r\\nbetter than it did him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him quietly, did not seem to recognize him, and then\\r\\nslowly laid aside her wraps. She had that calm assurance of a woman who\\r\\nis sure of herself, the insolent audacity of a first awakening, knowing\\r\\nand feeling that she was in her full beauty and freshness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron really lost his head. Was it his wife, or somebody else who\\r\\nwas as like her as any sister could be? As he had not seen her for six\\r\\nyears he might be mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe yawned, and he knew her by her gesture, and she turned and looked at\\r\\nhim again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then\\r\\nlooked out at the country again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was upset and dreadfully perplexed, and waited, looking at her\\r\\nsideways, steadfastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; it was certainly his wife. How could he possibly have doubted?\\r\\nThere could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand\\r\\nrecollections flashed through him, slight details of her body, a\\r\\nbeauty-spot on one of her thighs, and another opposite to it on her\\r\\nback. How often he had kissed them! He felt the old feeling of the\\r\\nintoxication of love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet\\r\\nodor of her skin, her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders,\\r\\nthe soft intonations of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. He\\r\\nthought her riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more\\r\\ndesirable, adorably desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a\\r\\nrailway-carriage belonged to him; he had only to say to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I insist upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he\\r\\nhad found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.\\r\\nIt was another, and yet she at the same time. It was another who had\\r\\nbeen born, and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she,\\r\\nindeed; she whom he had possessed but who was now altered, with a more\\r\\nassured smile and greater self-possession. There were two women in one,\\r\\nmingling a great past of what was new and unknown with many sweet\\r\\nrecollections of the past. There was something singular, disturbing,\\r\\nexciting about it--a kind of mystery of love in which there floated a\\r\\ndelicious confusion. It was his wife in a new body and in new flesh\\r\\nwhich lips had never pressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he thought that in six years everything changes in us, only the\\r\\noutline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood, the hair, the skin all change, and is reconstituted, and when\\r\\npeople have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they\\r\\nfind another totally different being, although it be the same and bear\\r\\nthe same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so\\r\\nthat in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant\\r\\ntransformations, become four or five totally new and different beings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken\\r\\npossession of him when he surprised her in the Princess\\'s room. He was\\r\\nnot the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking\\r\\nat--that thin, excitable little doll of those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to\\r\\nher? Had she recognized him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: \"Bertha, do you\\r\\nwant anything I could bring you?...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the\\r\\nslightest surprise or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect\\r\\nindifference:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not want anything,--thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to\\r\\nrecover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall.\\r\\nWhat should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as\\r\\nif he were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would\\r\\nlook as if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were\\r\\nher master? He would look like a fool, and besides, he really had no\\r\\nright to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got in again and took his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was\\r\\nnow lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to her, and said: \"My dear Bertha, since this singular chance\\r\\nhas brought us together after a separation of six years--a quite\\r\\nfriendly separation--are we to continue to look upon each other as\\r\\nirreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, _tête-à-tête_, which is\\r\\nso much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into\\r\\nanother carriage, so don\\'t you think it is preferable to talk as friends\\r\\ntill the end of our journey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered quite calmly again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had\\r\\nplenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle-seat, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,\\r\\nhowever, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how\\r\\nyou have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who\\r\\ncould give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now\\r\\nwhen you emerged from your wraps. I could really have thought such a\\r\\nchange impossible....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout moving her head or looking at him, she said: \"I cannot say the\\r\\nsame with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got red and confused, and then, with a smile of resignation, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" was her reply. \"I am only stating facts. I don\\'t suppose you\\r\\nintend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter of perfect\\r\\nindifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a painful\\r\\nsubject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been doing\\r\\nsince I last saw you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt rather out of countenance, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I? I have traveled, shot, and grown old, as you see. And you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said, quite calmly: \"I have taken care of appearances, as you\\r\\nordered me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very near saying something brutal, but he checked himself, and\\r\\nkissed his wife\\'s hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I thank you,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised. He was indeed cool and always master of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now talk\\r\\nwithout any bitterness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made a little movement of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bitterness? I don\\'t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I am\\r\\nonly trying to keep up a difficult conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still looking at her, carried away in spite of her harshness, and\\r\\nhe felt seized with a brutal desire, the desire of the master.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerceiving that she had hurt his feelings, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old are you now? I thought you were younger than you look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grew rather pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am forty-five;\" and then he added: \"I forgot to ask after Princess de\\r\\nRaynes. Are you still intimate with her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him as if she hated him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I certainly am. She is very well, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey remained sitting side-by-side, agitated and irritated. Suddenly he\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I expect\\r\\nyou to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both morally and\\r\\nphysically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your husband,\\r\\nand it is my right to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but\\r\\nhis face was resolute and impenetrable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" she said, \"but I have made other engagements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse for you,\" was his reply. \"The law gives me the power,\\r\\nand I mean to use it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were getting to Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened\\r\\nspeed. The Baroness got up, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then\\r\\nturning to her husband, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of the _tête-à-tête_ which I had\\r\\ncarefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your\\r\\nadvice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other\\r\\npeople, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall go wherever you go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me in\\r\\npeace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the\\r\\nPrincess de Raynes and Countess Hermit waiting for me with their\\r\\nhusbands. I wished them to see us, and to know that we had spent the\\r\\nnight together in the railway-carriage. Don\\'t be alarmed; they will tell\\r\\nit everywhere as a most surprising fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice and\\r\\nsaved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in\\r\\norder to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to\\r\\navoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid--I am\\r\\nafraid--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up\\r\\nto open the carriage-door, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that I am in the family-way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess stretched out her arms to embrace her, and the Baroness\\r\\nsaid, pointing to the Baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was\\r\\ntrying to get at the truth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal, and\\r\\nhe agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take\\r\\nlittle trips like this, occasionally, like good friends who cannot live\\r\\ntogether. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped\\r\\nout on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron hastily shut the carriage-door, for he was too much disturbed\\r\\nto say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife\\'s voice,\\r\\nand their merry laughter as they went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told\\r\\nhim a lie or was speaking the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE CASK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJules Chicot, the innkeeper, who lived at Épreville, pulled up his\\r\\ntilbury in front of Mother Magloire\\'s farmhouse. He was a tall man of\\r\\nabout forty, with a red face and a round stomach, and was generally said\\r\\nto be _a very knowing customer_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hitched his horse up to the gatepost and went in. He owned some land\\r\\nadjoining that of the old woman\\'s, which he had been coveting for a long\\r\\nwhile, and had tried in vain to buy a score of times, but she had always\\r\\nobstinately refused to part with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was born here, and here I mean to die,\" was all she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door. She was a\\r\\nwoman of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost\\r\\ndried up in fact, and much bent, but as active and untiring as a girl.\\r\\nChicot patted her on the back in a very friendly fashion, and then sat\\r\\ndown by her on a stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Mother, you are always pretty well and hearty, I am glad to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to complain of, considering, thank you. And how are you, Mons.\\r\\nChicot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains occasionally;\\r\\notherwise, I should have nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all the better!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work.\\r\\nHer crooked, knotty fingers, hard as a lobster\\'s claws, seized the\\r\\ntubers, which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of\\r\\npincers, and she peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin\\r\\nwith an old knife which she held in the other hand, throwing the\\r\\npotatoes into the water as they were done. Three daring fowls jumped one\\r\\nafter the other into her lap, seized a bit of peel, and then ran away as\\r\\nfast as their legs would carry them with it in their beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his\\r\\ntongue which he could not get out. At last he said hurriedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Mother Magloire--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your farm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not; you may make up your mind to that. What I have said, I\\r\\nhave said, so don\\'t refer to it again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well; only I fancy I have thought of an arrangement that might\\r\\nsuit us both very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are. You shall sell it to me, and keep it all the same. You\\r\\ndon\\'t understand? Very well, so just follow me in what I am going to\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman left off peeling her potatoes, and looked at the innkeeper\\r\\nattentively from under her bushy eyebrows, and he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me explain myself. Every month I will give you one hundred and\\r\\nfifty francs. You understand me, I suppose? Every month I will come and\\r\\nbring you thirty crowns[13] and it will not make the slightest\\r\\ndifference in your life--not the very slightest. You will have your own\\r\\nhome just as you have now, will not trouble yourself about me, and will\\r\\nowe me nothing; all you will have to do will be to take my money. Will\\r\\nthat arrangement suit you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said\\r\\nbenevolently, and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if\\r\\nshe suspected a trap, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems all right, as far as I am concerned, but it will not give you\\r\\nthe farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind about that,\" he said, \"you will remain here as long as it\\r\\npleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home. Only you\\r\\nwill sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me after your death.\\r\\nYou have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don\\'t care a\\r\\nstraw. Will that suit you? You will keep everything during your life,\\r\\nand I will give you the thirty crowns a month. It is pure gain as far as\\r\\nyou are concerned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but nevertheless, very much\\r\\ntempted to agree, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.\\r\\nCome back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then\\r\\ngive you my definite answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Chicot went off, as happy as a king who has conquered an empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in\\r\\nfact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation. She _smelt_, so to\\r\\nsay, that there was something underneath the offer which was not to her\\r\\nadvantage; but then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those\\r\\ncoins chinking in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies,\\r\\nwithout her doing anything for it, filled her with covetousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the notary, and told him about it. He advised her to accept\\r\\nChicot\\'s offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty\\r\\ninstead of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the\\r\\nlowest calculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you live for fifteen years longer,\" he said, \"even then he will only\\r\\nhave paid forty-five thousand francs for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns\\r\\na month; but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she\\r\\nremained a long time with the lawyer, asking questions without being\\r\\nable to make up her mind to go. At last she gave him instructions to\\r\\ndraw up the deed, and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if\\r\\nshe had drunk four jugs of new cider.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Chicot came again to receive her answer she took a lot of\\r\\npersuading, and declared that she could not make up her mind to agree to\\r\\nhis proposal, though she was all the time on tenter-hooks lest he should\\r\\nnot consent to give the fifty crowns: but at last, when he grew urgent,\\r\\nshe told him what she expected for her farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised and disappointed, and refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in order to convince him, she began to talk about the probable\\r\\nduration of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly not likely to live for more than five or six years\\r\\nlonger. I am nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering\\r\\nmy age. The other evening I thought I was going to die, and could\\r\\nhardly manage to crawl into bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Chicot was not going to be taken in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and will\\r\\nlive till you are a hundred at least; you will be sure to see me put\\r\\nunderground first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman\\r\\nwould not give way, the landlord consented to give the fifty crowns, and\\r\\nshe insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years passed by, and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day\\r\\nolder. Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been\\r\\npaying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done,\\r\\nthat he was ruined. From time to time he went to see his annuitant, just\\r\\nas one goes in July to see when the harvest is likely to begin. She\\r\\nalways met him with a cunning look, and one would have felt inclined to\\r\\nthink that she was congratulating herself on the trick she had played\\r\\nhim. Seeing how well and hearty she seemed, he very soon got into his\\r\\ntilbury again, growling to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you never die, you old brute?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he\\r\\nsaw her. He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a\\r\\npeasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for means of\\r\\ngetting rid of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands like he did the\\r\\nfirst time when he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a\\r\\nfew minutes, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you are\\r\\nin Épreville? The people are talking about it, and saying that we are\\r\\nnot on friendly terms, and that pains me. You know it will cost you\\r\\nnothing if you come, for I don\\'t look at the price of a dinner. Come\\r\\nwhenever you feel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Mother Magloire did not need to be told twice, and the next day but\\r\\none, as she was going to town in any case, it being market-day, in her\\r\\ngig, driven by her man, she, without any demur, put her trap up in\\r\\nChicot\\'s stable, and went in search of her promised dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe publican was delighted, and treated her like a lady, giving her\\r\\nroast fowl, blackpudding, leg of mutton, and bacon and cabbage. But she\\r\\nate next to nothing. She had always been a small eater, and had\\r\\ngenerally lived on a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot was disappointed, and pressed her to eat more, but she refused,\\r\\nand she would drink next to nothing either, and declined any coffee, so\\r\\nhe asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as to that, I don\\'t know that I will refuse.\" Whereupon he\\r\\nshouted out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosalie, bring the superfine brandy,--_the special_,--you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper\\r\\nvine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just try that; you will find it first-rate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last\\r\\nall the longer, and when she had finished her glass, draining the last\\r\\ndrops so as to make the pleasure last all the longer, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that is first-rate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost before she had said it, Chicot had poured her out another\\r\\nglassful. She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it\\r\\nvery slowly, like she had done the first, and he asked her to have a\\r\\nthird. She objected, but he persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen without any\\r\\nill effects; it goes down like sugar, and leaves no signs in the head,\\r\\none would think that it evaporated on the tongue. It is the most\\r\\nwholesome thing you can drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, for she really wished to have it, but she left half the\\r\\nglass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chicot, in an excess of generosity, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small keg\\r\\nof it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends.\" So she\\r\\ntook one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of what\\r\\nshe had drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the innkeeper drove into her yard, and took a little\\r\\niron-hooped keg out of his gig. He insisted on her tasting the contents,\\r\\nto make sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each\\r\\nof them drunk three more glasses, he said, as he was going away:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know, when it is all gone, there is more left; don\\'t be\\r\\nmodest, for I shall not mind. The sooner it is finished, the better\\r\\npleased I shall be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days later he came again. The old woman was outside her door\\r\\ncutting up the bread for her soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went up to her, and put his face close to hers, so that he might\\r\\nsmell her breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you will give me a glass of _the special_?\" he said. And they\\r\\nhad three glasses each.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was\\r\\nin the habit of getting drunk all by herself. She was picked up in her\\r\\nkitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and\\r\\nshe was often brought home like a log.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to him about\\r\\nher, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age; but\\r\\nwhen people get old there is no remedy. It will be the death of her in\\r\\nthe long run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it certainly was the death of her. She died the next winter. About\\r\\nChristmas-time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found\\r\\ndead the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Chicot came in for the farm he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very stupid of her; if she had not taken to drink she might very\\r\\nwell have lived for ten years longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW HE GOT THE LEGION OF HONOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people are born with a predominant instinct, with some vocation or\\r\\nsome desire which has been evoked as soon as they begin to speak or to\\r\\nthink.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since he was a child M. Caillard had only had one idea in his\\r\\nhead--to be decorated. When he was still quite a small boy he used to\\r\\nwear a zinc Cross of the Legion of Honor in his tunic, just like other\\r\\nchildren wear a soldier\\'s cap, and he took his mother\\'s hand in the\\r\\nstreet with a proud look, sticking out his little chest with its red\\r\\nribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis studies were not a success, and he failed in his Examination for\\r\\nBachelor of Arts; so, not knowing what to do, he married a pretty girl,\\r\\nas he had plenty of money of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived in Paris, like many rich middle-class people do, mixing with\\r\\ntheir own particular set, without going among other people, and proud of\\r\\nknowing a Deputy, who might perhaps be a Minister some day, while two\\r\\nChiefs of Division were among their friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mons. Caillard could not get rid of his one absorbing idea, and he\\r\\nfelt constantly unhappy because he had not the right to wear a little\\r\\nbit of colored ribbon in his buttonhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he met any men who were decorated, on the boulevards, he looked at\\r\\nthem askance, with intense jealousy. Sometimes, when he had nothing to\\r\\ndo in the afternoon, he would count them, and say to himself: \"Just let\\r\\nme see how many I shall meet between the Madeleine and the Rue Druot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye\\r\\nfor the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his\\r\\nwalk he always said the numbers out aloud. \"Eight officers and seventeen\\r\\nknights. As many as that! It is stupid to sow the Cross broadcast in\\r\\nthat fashion. I wonder how many I shall meet going back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he returned slowly, unhappy when the crowd of passers-by interfered\\r\\nwith his seeing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew the places where most were to be found. They swarmed in the\\r\\nPalais Royal. Fewer were seen in the Avenue de l\\'Opera than in the Rue\\r\\nde la Paix, while the right side of the boulevard was more frequented by\\r\\nthem than the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also seemed to prefer certain cafés and theaters. Whenever he saw a\\r\\ngroup of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of\\r\\nthe pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:\\r\\n\"They are officers of the Legion of Honor,\" and he felt inclined to take\\r\\noff his hat to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had often remarked that the officers had a different bearing to the\\r\\nmere knights. They carried their head differently, and one felt that\\r\\nthey enjoyed a higher official consideration, and a more widely-extended\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes again the worthy man would be seized with a furious hatred for\\r\\neveryone who was decorated; he felt like a Socialist towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when he got home, excited at meeting so many Crosses--just like a\\r\\npoor hungry wretch is on passing some dainty provision shop--he used to\\r\\nask in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When shall we get rid of this wretched Government?\" And his wife would\\r\\nbe surprised, and ask:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am indignant,\" he replied, \"at the injustice I see going on around\\r\\nus. Oh! the Communards were certainly right!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner he would go out again and look at the shops where all the\\r\\ndecorations were sold, and he examined all the emblems of various shapes\\r\\nand colors. He would have liked to possess them all, and to have walked\\r\\ngravely at the head of a procession with his crush-hat under his arm and\\r\\nhis breast covered with decorations, radiant as a star, amid a buzz of\\r\\nadmiring whispers and a hum of respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! he had no right to wear any decoration whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used to say to himself: \"It is really too difficult for any man to\\r\\nobtain the Legion of Honor unless he is some public functionary. Suppose\\r\\nI try to get appointed an officer of the Academy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did not know how to set about it, and spoke to his wife on the\\r\\nsubject, who was stupefied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Officer of the Academy! What have you done to deserve it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got angry. \"I know what I am talking about; I only want to know how\\r\\nto set about it. You are quite stupid at times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled. \"You are quite right; I don\\'t understand anything about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn idea struck him: \"Suppose you were to speak to M. Rosselin, the\\r\\nDeputy, he might be able to advise me. You understand I cannot broach\\r\\nthe subject to him directly. It is rather difficult and delicate, but\\r\\ncoming from you it might seem quite natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Caillard did what he asked her, and M. Rosselin promised to speak\\r\\nto the Minister about it, and then Caillard began to worry him, till the\\r\\nDeputy told him he must make a formal application and put forward his\\r\\nclaims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What were his claims?\" he said. \"He was not even a Bachelor of Arts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he set to work and produced a pamphlet, with the title, \"The\\r\\nPeople\\'s Right to Instruction,\" but he could not finish it for want of\\r\\nideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The\\r\\nfirst was, \"The Instruction of Children by means of the Eye.\" He wanted\\r\\ngratuitous theaters to be established in every poor quarter of Paris for\\r\\nlittle children. Their parents were to take them there when they were\\r\\nquite young, and, by means of a magic-lantern, all the notions of human\\r\\nknowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular courses.\\r\\nThe sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain\\r\\nimpressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made\\r\\nvisible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history,\\r\\nnatural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, &c., &c., thus?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his ideas printed in tract form, and sent a copy to each Deputy,\\r\\nten to each Minister, fifty to the President of the Republic, ten to\\r\\neach Parisian and five to each provincial newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he wrote on \"Street Lending-Libraries.\" His idea was to have\\r\\nlittle carts full of books drawn about the streets, like orange-carts\\r\\nare. Every householder or lodger would have a right to ten volumes a\\r\\nmonth by means of a halfpenny subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The people,\" M. Caillard said, \"will only disturb itself for the sake\\r\\nof its pleasures, and since it will not go to instruction, instruction\\r\\nmust come to it,\" &c., &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis essays attracted no attention, but he sent in his application, and\\r\\nhe got the usual formal official reply. He thought himself sure of\\r\\nsuccess, but nothing came of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made up his mind to apply personally. He begged for an interview\\r\\nwith the Minister of Public Instruction, and he was received by a young\\r\\nsubordinate, who already was very grave and important, and who kept\\r\\ntouching the knobs of electric-bells to summon ushers, and footmen, and\\r\\nofficials inferior to himself. He declared to M. Caillard that his\\r\\nmatter was going on quite favorably, and advised him to continue his\\r\\nremarkable labors, and M. Caillard set at it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Rosselin, the Deputy, seemed now to take a great interest in his\\r\\nsuccess, and gave him a lot of excellent, practical advice. He was\\r\\ndecorated, although nobody knew exactly what he had done to deserve such\\r\\na distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told Caillard what new studies he ought to undertake; he introduced\\r\\nhim to learned Societies which took up particularly obscure points of\\r\\nscience, in the hope of gaining credit and honors thereby; and he even\\r\\ntook him under his wing at the Ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when he came to lunch with his friend (for several months past\\r\\nhe had constantly taken his meals there), he said to him in a whisper as\\r\\nhe shook hands: \"I have just obtained a great favor for you. The\\r\\nCommittee of Historical Works is going to intrust you with a commission.\\r\\nThere are some researches to be made in various libraries in France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaillard was so delighted that he could scarcely eat or drink, and a\\r\\nweek later he set out. He went from town to town, studying catalogues,\\r\\nrummaging in lofts full of dusty volumes, and was hated by all the\\r\\nlibrarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, happening to be at Rouen, he thought he should like to go and\\r\\nembrace his wife, whom he had not seen for more than a week, so he took\\r\\nthe nine o\\'clock train, which would land him at home by twelve at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his latchkey, so he went in without making any noise, delighted\\r\\nat the idea of the surprise he was going to give her. She had locked\\r\\nherself in. How tiresome! However, he cried out through the door:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jeanne, it is I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must have been very frightened, for he heard her jump out of bed and\\r\\nspeak to herself, as if she were in a dream. Then she went to her\\r\\ndressing-room, opened and closed the door, and went quickly up and down\\r\\nher room barefoot two or three times, shaking the furniture till the\\r\\nvases and glasses sounded. Then at last she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it you, Alexander?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he replied; \"make haste and open the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had done so, she threw herself into his arms, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! what a fright!... What a surprise!... What a pleasure!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to undress himself methodically, like he did everything, and\\r\\nfrom a chair he took his overcoat, which he was in the habit of hanging\\r\\nup in the hall. But, suddenly, he remained motionless, struck dumb with\\r\\nastonishment--there was a red ribbon in the buttonhole!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" he stammered, \"this--this--this--this overcoat has got the\\r\\nrosette in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a second his wife threw herself on him, and taking it from his hands,\\r\\nshe said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! you have made a mistake--give it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he still held it by one of the sleeves, without letting it go,\\r\\nrepeating, in a half-dazed manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Why? Just explain ... whose overcoat is it? It is not mine, as it\\r\\nhas the Legion of Honor on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to take it from him, terrified, and hardly able to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen ... listen ... give it me ... I must not tell you ... it is a\\r\\nsecret ... listen to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he grew angry, and turned pale:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know how this overcoat comes to be here? It does not belong\\r\\nto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she almost screamed at him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes it does; listen ... swear to me ... well ... you are decorated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not intend to joke at his expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so overcome that he let the overcoat fall, and dropped into an\\r\\narmchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am ... you say I am ... decorated?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but it is a secret, a great secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had put the glorious garment into a cupboard, and came to her\\r\\nhusband pale and trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she continued, \"it is a new overcoat that I have had made for\\r\\nyou. But I swore that I would not tell you anything about it, as it will\\r\\nnot be officially announced for a month or six weeks, and you were not\\r\\nto have known till your return from your business journey. M. Rosselin\\r\\nmanaged it for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin!\" he contrived to utter in his joy; \"he has obtained the\\r\\ndecoration for me? He--Oh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he was obliged to drink a glass of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the\\r\\novercoat. Caillard picked it up; it was a visiting-card, and he read\\r\\nout:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin--Deputy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see how it is,\" said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe almost cried with joy, and, a week later, it was announced in the\\r\\n_Journal Officiel_ that M. Caillard had been awarded the Legion of Honor\\r\\non account of his exceptional services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ACCURSED BREAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDaddy Taille had three daughters: Anna, the eldest, who was scarcely\\r\\never mentioned in the family; Rose, the second girl, who was eighteen;\\r\\nand Clara, the youngest, who was a girl of fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Taille was a widower, and a foreman in M. Lebrument\\'s\\r\\nbutton-manufactory. He was a very upright man, very well thought of,\\r\\nabstemious; in fact a sort of model workman. He lived at Havre, in the\\r\\nRue d\\'Angoulême.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Anna ran away the old man flew into a fearful rage. He threatened\\r\\nto kill the seducer, who was head clerk in a large draper\\'s\\r\\nestablishment in that town. Then, when he was told by various people\\r\\nthat she was keeping very steady and investing money in Government\\r\\nsecurities, that she was no gadabout, but was kept by a Mons. Dubois,\\r\\nwho was a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, the father was appeased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe even showed some anxiety as to how she was getting on, asked some of\\r\\nher old friends who had been to see her how she was getting on; and when\\r\\ntold that she had her own furniture, and that her mantelpiece was\\r\\ncovered with vases and the walls with pictures, that there were clocks\\r\\nand carpets everywhere, he gave a broad, contented smile. He had been\\r\\nworking for thirty years to get together a wretched five or six thousand\\r\\nfrancs. This girl was evidently no fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning the son of Touchard, the cooper, at the other end of\\r\\nthe street, came and asked him for the hand of Rose, the second girl.\\r\\nThe old man\\'s heart began to beat, for the Touchards were rich and in a\\r\\ngood position. He was decidedly lucky with his girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage was agreed upon, and it was settled that it should be a\\r\\ngrand affair, and the wedding dinner was to be held at Sainte-Adresse,\\r\\nat Mother Lusa\\'s restaurant. It would cost a lot certainly; but never\\r\\nmind, it did not matter just for once in a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one morning, just as the old man was going home to breakfast with\\r\\nhis two daughters the door opened suddenly, and Anna appeared. She was\\r\\nelegantly dressed, wore rings and an expensive bonnet, and looked\\r\\nundeniably pretty and nice. She threw her arms round her father\\'s neck\\r\\nbefore he could say a word, then fell into her sister\\'s arms with many\\r\\ntears, and then asked for a plate, so that she might share the family\\r\\nsoup. Taille was moved to tears in his turn and said several times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right, dear; that is right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told them about herself. She did not wish Rose\\'s wedding to\\r\\ntake place at Sainte-Adresse,--certainly not. It should take place at\\r\\nher house, and would cost her father nothing. She had settled everything\\r\\nand arranged everything, so it was \"no good to say any more about\\r\\nit,--there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear! very well!\" the old man said, \"we will leave it\\r\\nso.\" But then he felt some doubt. Would the Touchards consent? But Rose,\\r\\nthe bride-elect, was surprised and asked, \"Why should they object, I\\r\\nshould like to know? Just leave that to me, I will talk to Philip about\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mentioned it to her lover the very same day, and he declared that\\r\\nit would suit him exactly. Father and Mother Touchard were naturally\\r\\ndelighted at the idea of a good dinner which would cost them nothing,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be quite sure that everything will be in first-rate style, as\\r\\nM. Dubois is made of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey asked to be allowed to bring a friend, Mme. Florence, the cook on\\r\\nthe first floor, and Anna agreed to everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was fixed for the last Tuesday of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the civil formalities and the religious ceremony the wedding party\\r\\nwent to Anna\\'s house. Among those whom the Tailles had brought was a\\r\\ncousin of a certain age, a M. Sauvetanin, a man given to philosophical\\r\\nreflections, serious, and always very self-possessed, and Mme.\\r\\nLamonoois, an old aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Sauvetanin had been told off to give Anna his arm, as they were\\r\\nlooked upon as the two most important persons in the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they had arrived at the door of Anna\\'s house she let go her\\r\\ncompanion\\'s arm, and ran on ahead, saying, \"I will show you the way,\"\\r\\nand ran upstairs while the invited guests followed more slowly; and,\\r\\nwhen they got upstairs, she stood on one side to let them pass, and they\\r\\nrolled their eyes and turned their heads in all directions to admire\\r\\nthis mysterious and luxurious dwelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was laid in the drawing-room as the dining-room had been\\r\\nthought too small. Extra knives, forks, and spoons had been hired from\\r\\na neighboring restaurant, and decanters full of wine under the rays of\\r\\nthe sun which shown in through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies went into the bedroom to take off their shawls and bonnets,\\r\\nand Father Touchard, who was standing at the door, squinted at the low\\r\\nwide bed, and made funny and suggestive signs to the men, with many a\\r\\nwink and a nod. Daddy Taille, who thought a great deal of himself,\\r\\nlooked with fatherly pride at his child\\'s well-furnished rooms, and went\\r\\nfrom one to the other holding his hat in his hand, making a mental\\r\\ninventory of everything, and walking like a verger in a church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna went backwards and forwards, ran about giving orders and hurrying\\r\\non the wedding feast. Soon she appeared at the door of the dining-room,\\r\\nand cried: \"Come here, all of you, for a moment,\" and when the twelve\\r\\nguests did as they were asked they saw twelve glasses of Madeira on a\\r\\nsmall table.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose and her husband had their arms round each other\\'s waists, and were\\r\\nkissing each other in every corner. Mons. Sauvetanin never took his eyes\\r\\noff Anna; he no doubt felt that ardor, that sort of expectation which\\r\\nall men, even if they are old and ugly, feel for women of a certain\\r\\nstamp, as if they owed a little of themselves, professionally, to all\\r\\nmales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down, and the wedding-breakfast began; the relations sitting at\\r\\none end of the table and the young people at the other. Mme. Touchard,\\r\\nthe mother, presided on the right and the bride on the left. Anna looked\\r\\nafter everybody, saw that the glasses were kept filled and the plates\\r\\nwell supplied. The guests evidently felt a certain respectful\\r\\nembarrassment at the sight of all the sumptuousness of the rooms and at\\r\\nthe lavish manner in which they were treated. They all ate heartily of\\r\\nthe good things provided, but there were no jokes such as are prevalent\\r\\nat weddings of that sort; it was all too grand, and it made them feel\\r\\nuncomfortable. Old Madame Touchard, who was fond of a bit of fun, tried\\r\\nto enliven matters a little, and at the beginning of the dessert she\\r\\nexclaimed: \"I say, Philip, do sing us something.\" The neighbors in their\\r\\nstreet considered that he had the finest voice in all Havre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom got up, smiled, and turning to his sister-in-law, from\\r\\npoliteness and gallantry, tried to think of something suitable for the\\r\\noccasion, something serious and correct, to harmonize with the\\r\\nseriousness of the repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna had a satisfied look on her face, and leaned back in her chair to\\r\\nlisten, and all assumed looks of attention, though prepared to smile\\r\\nshould smiles be called for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singer announced, \"The Accursed Bread,\" and extending his right arm,\\r\\nwhich made his coat ruck up into his neck, he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was decidedly long, three verses of eight lines each, with the last\\r\\nline and the last line but one repeated twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went well for the first two verses; they were the usual commonplaces\\r\\nabout bread gained by honest labor and by dishonesty. The aunt and the\\r\\nbride wept outright. The cook, who was present, at the end of the first\\r\\nverse looked at a roll which she held in her hand with running eyes, as\\r\\nif they applied to her, while all applauded vigorously. At the end of\\r\\nthe second verse the two servants, who were standing with their backs\\r\\nto the wall, joined loudly in the chorus, and the aunt and the bride\\r\\nwept outright. Daddy Taille blew his nose with the noise of a trombone,\\r\\nand old Touchard brandished a whole loaf half over the table, and the\\r\\ncook shed silent tears on the crust which she was still holding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmidst the general emotion M. Sauvetanin said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the right sort of song; very different to the nasty, risky\\r\\nthings one generally hears at weddings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna, who was visibly affected, kissed her hand to her sister, and\\r\\npointed to her husband with an affectionate nod, as if to congratulate\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntoxicated by his success, the young man continued, and unfortunately\\r\\nthe last verse contained the words about the bread of dishonor gained by\\r\\nyoung girls who had been led astray from the paths of virtue. No one\\r\\ntook up the refrain about this bread, supposed to be eaten with tears,\\r\\nexcept old Touchard and the two servants. Anna had grown deadly pale,\\r\\nand cast down her eyes, while the bridegroom looked from one to the\\r\\nother without understanding the reason for this sudden coldness, and the\\r\\ncook hastily dropped the crust as if it were poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMons. Sauvetanin said solemnly, in order to save the situation: \"That\\r\\nlast couplet is not at all necessary;\" and Daddy Taille, who had got red\\r\\nup to the ears, looked round the table fiercely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Anna, with her eyes swimming in tears, told the servants, in the\\r\\nfaltering voice of a woman trying to stifle her sobs, to bring the\\r\\nchampagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the guests were suddenly seized with exuberant joy, and all their\\r\\nfaces became radiant again. And when old Touchard, who had seen, felt,\\r\\nand understood nothing of what was going on, and, pointing to the guests\\r\\nso as to emphasize his words, sang the last words of the refrain:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread,\" the whole company,\\r\\nwhen they saw the champagne bottles, with their necks covered with gold\\r\\nfoil appear, burst out singing, as if electrified by the sight:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT WAS REALLY THE MATTER WITH ANDREW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer\\'s house looked on to the Square. Behind it, there was a nice,\\r\\nwell-kept garden, with a back entrance into a narrow street which was\\r\\nalmost always deserted, and from which it was separated by a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of that garden Maitre[14] Moreau\\'s wife had promised, for\\r\\nthe first time, to meet Captain Sommerive, who had been making love to\\r\\nher for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband had gone to Paris for a week, so she was quite free for the\\r\\ntime being. The Captain had begged so hard, and had used such loving\\r\\nwords, she was certain that he loved her so ardently, and she felt so\\r\\nisolated, so misunderstood, so neglected amidst all the law business\\r\\nwhich seemed to be her husband\\'s sole pleasure, that she had given away\\r\\nher heart without even asking herself whether it would give her anything\\r\\nelse at some future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, after some months of platonic love, of pressing of hands, of\\r\\nkisses rapidly stolen behind a door, the Captain had declared that he\\r\\nwould ask permission to exchange, and leave the town immediately, if she\\r\\nwould not grant him a meeting, a real meeting, during her husband\\'s\\r\\nabsence; and so at length she yielded to his importunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she was waiting, close against the wall, with a beating heart,\\r\\ntrembling at the slightest sound, and when at length she heard somebody\\r\\nclimbing up the wall, she very nearly ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose it were not he, but a thief? But no; someone called out softly,\\r\\n\"_Matilda_!\" and when she replied, \"_Etienne_!\" a man jumped on to the\\r\\npath with a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was he,--and what a kiss!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time they remained in each other\\'s arms, with united lips.\\r\\nBut suddenly a fine rain began to fall, and the drops from the leaves\\r\\nfell on to her neck and made her start. Whereupon he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Matilda, my adored one, my darling, my angel, let us go indoors. It is\\r\\ntwelve o\\'clock, we can have nothing to fear; please let us go to your\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dearest; I am too frightened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he held her in his arms, and whispered in her ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your servants sleep on the third floor, looking on to the Square, and\\r\\nyour room, on the first, looks on to the garden, so nobody can hear us.\\r\\nI love you so that I wish to love you entirely, from head to foot.\" And\\r\\nhe embraced her vehemently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe resisted still, frightened and even ashamed. But he put his arms\\r\\nround her, lifted her up, and carried her off under the rain, which was\\r\\nby this time descending in torrents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was open; they groped their way upstairs; and when they were in\\r\\nthe room he bolted the door while she lit a match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she fell, half fainting, into a chair, while he knelt down beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, she said, panting:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Etienne, please let me remain a virtuous woman; I should be\\r\\ntoo angry with you afterwards; and after all, it is so horrid, so\\r\\ncommon. Cannot we love each other with a spiritual love only?... Oh!\\r\\nEtienne!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was inexorable, and then she tried to get up and escape from his\\r\\nattacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her fright she ran to the bed in order to hide herself behind the\\r\\ncurtains; but it was a dangerous place of refuge, and he followed her.\\r\\nBut in haste he took off his sword too quickly, and it fell on the floor\\r\\nwith a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then--a prolonged, shrill child\\'s cry came from the next room, the\\r\\ndoor of which had remained open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have awakened the child,\" she whispered, \"and perhaps he will not\\r\\ngo to sleep again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was only fifteen months old, and slept in a room opening out of hers,\\r\\nso that she might be able to hear him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain exclaimed, ardently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does it matter, Matilda? How I love you; you must come to me,\\r\\nMatilda.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she struggled, and resisted in her fright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Just listen how he is crying; he will wake up the nurse, and\\r\\nwhat should we do if she were to come? We should be lost. Just listen to\\r\\nme, Etienne. When he screams at night his father always takes him into\\r\\nour bed, and he is quiet immediately; it is the only means of keeping\\r\\nhim still. Do let me take him....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child roared, uttered shrill screams, which pierced the thickest\\r\\nwalls, so as to be heard by passers-by in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his consternation, the Captain got up, and Matilda jumped out and\\r\\ntook the child into her bed, when he was quiet at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtienne sat astride on a chair, and made a cigarette, and in about five\\r\\nminutes Andrew went to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take him back,\" his mother said; and she took him back very\\r\\ncarefully to his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned, the Captain was waiting for her with open arms, and\\r\\nput his arms round her in a transport of love, while she, embracing him\\r\\nmore closely, said, stammering:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Etienne, my darling, if you only knew how I love you; how....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew began to cry again, and he, in a rage, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confound it all, won\\'t the little brute be quiet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, the little brute would not be quiet, but howled all the louder, on\\r\\nthe contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought she heard a noise downstairs; no doubt the nurse was coming,\\r\\nso she jumped up, and took the child into bed, and he grew quiet\\r\\ndirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree times she put him back, and three times she had to fetch him\\r\\nagain, and an hour before daybreak the Captain had to go, swearing like\\r\\nthe proverbial trooper; and, to calm his impatience, Matilda promised to\\r\\nreceive him again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course he came, more impatient and ardent than ever, excited by the\\r\\ndelay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took care to put his sword carefully into a corner; he took off his\\r\\nboots like a thief, and spoke so low that Matilda could hardly hear him.\\r\\nAt last, he was just going to be really happy when the floor, or some\\r\\npiece of furniture, or perhaps the bed itself, creaked; it sounded as\\r\\nif something had broken; and in a moment a cry, feeble at first, but\\r\\nwhich grew louder every moment, made itself heard. Andrew was awake\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe _yapped_ like a fox, and there was not the slightest doubt that if he\\r\\nwent on like that the whole house would awake; so his mother, not\\r\\nknowing what to do, got up and brought him. The Captain was more furious\\r\\nthan ever, but did not move, and very carefully he put out his hand,\\r\\ntook a small piece of the child\\'s skin between his two fingers, no\\r\\nmatter where it was, the thighs or elsewhere, and pinched it. The little\\r\\none struggled and screamed in a deafening manner, but his tormentor\\r\\npinched everywhere furiously and more vigorously. He took a morsel of\\r\\nflesh and twisted and turned it, and then let go in order to take hold\\r\\nof another piece, and then another and another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child screamed like a chicken that is having its throat cut, or a\\r\\ndog that is being mercilessly beaten. His mother caressed him, kissed\\r\\nhim, and tried to stifle his cries by her tenderness; but Andrew grew\\r\\npurple, as if he were going into convulsions, and kicked and struggled\\r\\nwith his little arms and legs in an alarming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain said, softly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try and take him back to his cradle; perhaps he will be quiet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Matilda went into the other room with the child in her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he was out of his mother\\'s bed he cried less loudly, and when\\r\\nhe was in his own he was quiet, with exception of a few broken sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the night was tranquil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night he came again. As he happened to speak rather loudly,\\r\\nAndrew awoke again and began to scream. His mother went and fetched him\\r\\nimmediately, but the Captain pinched so hard and long that the child was\\r\\nnearly suffocated by its cries, and its eyes turned in its head and it\\r\\nfoamed at the mouth; as soon as it was back in its cradle it was quiet,\\r\\nand in four days Andrew did not cry any more to come into his mother\\'s\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday evening the lawyer returned, and took his place again at the\\r\\ndomestic hearth and in the conjugal chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was tired with his journey he went to bed early; but he had not\\r\\nlong lain down when he said to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, how is it that Andrew is not crying? Just go and fetch him,\\r\\nMatilda; I like to feel that he is between us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up and brought the child, but as soon as he saw that he was in\\r\\nthat bed, in which he had been so fond of sleeping a few days\\r\\npreviously, he wriggled and screamed so violently in his fright that she\\r\\nhad to take him back to his cradle.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Moreau could not get over his surprise. \"What a very funny thing!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with him this evening? I suppose he is sleepy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been like that all the time that you were away; I have never\\r\\nbeen able to have him in bed with me once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the child woke up and began to laugh and play with his\\r\\ntoys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer, who was an affectionate man, got up, kissed his offspring,\\r\\nand took him into his arms to carry him to their bed. Andrew laughed,\\r\\nwith that vacant laugh of little creatures whose ideas are still vague.\\r\\nHe suddenly saw the bed and his mother in it, and his happy little face\\r\\npuckered up, till suddenly he began to scream furiously, and struggled\\r\\nas if he were going to be put to the torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment his father said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be something the matter with the child,\" and mechanically he\\r\\nlifted up his little nightshirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe uttered a prolonged \"O--o--h!\" of astonishment. The child\\'s calves,\\r\\nthighs, and buttocks were covered with blue spots as big as halfpennies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look, Matilda!\" the father exclaimed; \"this is horrible!\" And the\\r\\nmother rushed forward in a fright. It was horrible; no doubt the\\r\\nbeginning of some sort of leprosy, of one of those strange affections of\\r\\nthe skin which doctors are often at a loss to account for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parents looked at one another in consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must send for the doctor,\" the father said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Matilda, pale as death, was looking at her child, who was spotted\\r\\nlike a leopard. Then suddenly uttering a violent cry, as if she had seen\\r\\nsomething that filled her with horror, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! the wretch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment M. Moreau asked: \"What are you talking about? What\\r\\nwretch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red up to the roots of her hair, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing! but I think I can guess--it must be--we ought to send for\\r\\nthe doctor ... it must be that wretch of a nurse who has been pinching\\r\\nthe poor child to make him keep quiet when he cries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his rage the lawyer sent for the nurse, and very nearly beat her.\\r\\nShe denied it most impudently, but was instantly dismissed, and the\\r\\nMunicipality having been informed of her conduct, she will find it a\\r\\nhard matter to get another situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY LANDLADY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time (George Kervelen said) I was living in furnished lodgings\\r\\nin the Rue des Saints-Pères.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my father had made up his mind that I should go to Paris to\\r\\ncontinue my law studies, there had been a long discussion about settling\\r\\neverything. My allowance had been fixed at first at two thousand five\\r\\nhundred francs, but my poor mother was so anxious, that she said to my\\r\\nfather that if I spent my money badly I might not take enough to eat,\\r\\nand then my health would suffer, and so it was settled that a\\r\\ncomfortable boarding-house should be found for me, and that the amount\\r\\nshould be paid to the proprietor himself, or herself, every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of our neighbors told us of a certain Mme. Kergaran, a native of\\r\\nBrittany, who took in boarders, and so my father arranged matters by\\r\\nletter with this respectable person, at whose house I and my luggage\\r\\narrived one evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was a woman of about forty. She was very stout, had a\\r\\nvoice like a drill-sergeant, and decided everything in a very abrupt\\r\\nmanner. Her house was narrow, with only one window opening on to the\\r\\nstreet on each story, which rather gave it the appearance of a ladder of\\r\\nwindows, or better, perhaps, of a slice of a house sandwiched in between\\r\\ntwo others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady lived on the first floor with her servant, the kitchen and\\r\\ndining-room were on the second, and four boarders from Brittany lived\\r\\non the third and fourth, and I had two rooms on the fifth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little dark corkscrew staircase led up to these attics. All day long\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was up and down these stairs like a captain on board ship.\\r\\nTen times a day she would go into each room, noisily superintending\\r\\neverything, seeing that the beds were properly made, the clothes well\\r\\nbrushed, if the attendance were all that it should be; in a word, she\\r\\nlooked after her boarders like a mother, and better than a mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon made the acquaintance of my four fellow-countrymen. Two were\\r\\nmedical and two were law students, but all impartially endured the\\r\\nlandlady\\'s despotic yoke. They were as frightened of her as a boy\\r\\nrobbing an orchard would be of a rural policeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, immediately felt that I wished to be independent; it is my\\r\\nnature to rebel. I declared at once that I meant to come in at whatever\\r\\ntime I liked, for Mme. Kergaran had fixed twelve o\\'clock at night as the\\r\\nlimit. On hearing this she looked at me for a few moments, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is quite impossible; I cannot have Annette awakened at any hour of\\r\\nthe night. You can have nothing to do out-of-doors at such a time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied firmly that, according to the law, she was obliged to open the\\r\\ndoor for me at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you refuse,\" I said, \"I shall get a policeman to witness the fact,\\r\\nand go and get a bed at some hotel, at your expense, in which I shall be\\r\\nfully justified. You will, therefore, be obliged either to open the door\\r\\nfor me or to get rid of me. Do which you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed in her face as I told her my conditions. She could not speak\\r\\nfor a moment for surprise, then she tried to negotiate, but I was firm,\\r\\nand she was obliged to yield; and so it was agreed that I should have a\\r\\nlatchkey, on my solemn undertaking that no one else should know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy energy made such a wholesome impression on her that from that time\\r\\nshe treated me with marked favor; she was most attentive, and even\\r\\nshowed me a sort of rough tenderness which was not at all unpleasing.\\r\\nSometimes when I was in a jovial mood I would kiss her by surprise, if\\r\\nonly for the sake of getting the box on the ears which she gave me\\r\\nimmediately afterwards. When I managed to duck my head quickly enough,\\r\\nher hand would pass over me as swiftly as a ball, and I would run away\\r\\nlaughing, while she would call after me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you wretch, I will pay you out for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we soon became real friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I made the acquaintance of a girl who was\\r\\nemployed in a shop, and whom I constantly met. You know what such sort\\r\\nof love affairs are in Paris. One fine day, going to a lecture, you meet\\r\\na work-girl going to work arm-in-arm with a friend. You look at her and\\r\\nfeel that pleasant little shock which the eye of some women gives you.\\r\\nThe next day at the same time, going through the same street, you meet\\r\\nher again, and the next, and the succeeding days. At last you speak, and\\r\\nthe love affair follows its course just like an illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, by the end of three weeks I was on that footing with Emma which\\r\\nprecedes a fall. The fall would indeed have taken place much sooner had\\r\\nI known where to bring it about. The girl lived at home, and utterly\\r\\nrefused to go to an hotel. I did not know how to manage, but at last I\\r\\ntook the desperate resolve to take her to my room some night at about\\r\\neleven o\\'clock, under the pretense of giving her a cup of tea. Mme.\\r\\nKergaran always went to bed at ten, so that we could get in by means of\\r\\nmy latchkey without exciting any attention, and go down again in an hour\\r\\nor two in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good deal of entreaty on my part, Emma accepted my invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not spend a very pleasant day, for I was by no means easy in my\\r\\nmind. I was afraid of complications, of a catastrophe, of some scandal.\\r\\nAt night I went into a café, and drank two cups of coffee, and three or\\r\\nfour glasses of cognac, to give me courage, and when I heard the clock\\r\\nstrike half-past ten, I went slowly to the place of meeting, where she\\r\\nwas already waiting for me. She took my arm in a coaxing manner, and we\\r\\nset off slowly towards my lodgings. The nearer we got to the door the\\r\\nmore nervous I got, and I thought to myself--\"If only Mme. Kergaran is\\r\\nin bed already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to Emma two or three times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Above all things, don\\'t make any noise on the stairs,\" to which she\\r\\nreplied, laughing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you afraid of being heard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I said, \"but I am afraid of waking the man who sleeps in the room\\r\\nnext to me, who is not at all well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got near the house I felt as frightened as a man does who is\\r\\ngoing to the dentist\\'s. All the windows were dark, so no doubt everybody\\r\\nwas asleep, and I breathed again. I opened the door as carefully as a\\r\\nthief, let my fair companion in, shut it behind me, and went upstairs on\\r\\ntiptoe, holding my breath, and striking wax-matches lest the girl\\r\\nshould make a false step.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we passed the landlady\\'s door I felt my heart beating very quickly,\\r\\nbut we reached the second floor, then the third, and at last the fifth,\\r\\nand got into my room. Victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I only dared to speak in a whisper, and took off my boots so as\\r\\nnot to make any noise. The tea, which I made over a spirit-lamp, was\\r\\nsoon drunk, and then I became pressing, till little by little, as if in\\r\\nplay, I, one by one, took off my companion\\'s clothes, who yielded while\\r\\nresisting, blushing, confused.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had absolutely nothing more on except a short white petticoat when\\r\\nmy door suddenly opened, and Mme. Kergaran appeared with a candle in her\\r\\nhand, in exactly the same costume as Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nI jumped away from her and remained standing up, looking at the two\\r\\nwomen, who were looking at each other. What was going to happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy landlady said, in a lofty tone of voice which I had never heard from\\r\\nher before:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Monsieur Kervelen, I will not have prostitutes in my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Madame Kergaran,\" I stammered, \"the young lady is a friend of\\r\\nmine. She just came in to have a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People don\\'t take tea in their chemise. You will please make this\\r\\nperson go directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, in a natural state of consternation, began to cry, and hid her\\r\\nface in her petticoat, and I lost my head, not knowing what to do or\\r\\nsay. My landlady added, with irresistible authority:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Help her to dress, and take her out at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly the only thing I could do, so I picked up her dress\\r\\nfrom the floor, put it over her head, and began to fasten it as best I\\r\\ncould. She helped me, crying all the time, hurrying and making all sorts\\r\\nof mistakes and unable to find either buttonholes or laces, while Mme.\\r\\nKergaran stood by motionless, with the candle in her hand, looking at us\\r\\nwith the severity of a judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Emma was dressed, without even stopping to button her boots,\\r\\nshe rushed past the landlady and ran down stairs. I followed her in my\\r\\nslippers and half undressed, and kept repeating: \"Mademoiselle!\\r\\nMademoiselle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I ought to say something to her, but I could not find\\r\\nanything. I overtook her just by the street-door, and tried to take her\\r\\ninto my arms, but she pushed me violently away, saying in a low, nervous\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave me alone, leave me alone!\" and so ran out into the street,\\r\\nclosing the door behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went upstairs again I found that Mme. Kergaran was waiting on the\\r\\nfirst landing, and I went up slowly, expecting, and ready for, anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer door was open, and she called me in, saying in a severe voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to speak to you, M. Kervelen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, with my head bent. She put her candle on the mantelpiece, and\\r\\nthen, folding her arms over her expansive bosom, which a fine white\\r\\ndressing-jacket hardly covered, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Monsieur Kervelen, you think my house is a house of ill-fame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not at all proud. I murmured:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, no! But, Mme. Kergaran, you must not be angry; you know what\\r\\nyoung men are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" was her answer, \"that I will not have such creatures here, so\\r\\nyou will understand that. I expect to have my house respected, and I\\r\\nwill not have it lose its reputation, you understand me? I know....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on thus for at least twenty minutes, overwhelming me with the\\r\\ngood name of her house, with reasons for her indignation, and loading me\\r\\nwith severe reproofs. I went to bed crestfallen, and resolved never\\r\\nagain to try such an experiment, so long, at least, as I continued to be\\r\\na lodger of Mme. Kergaran.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HORLA, OR MODERN GHOSTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 8._ What a beautiful day! I have spent all the morning lying in the\\r\\ngrass in front of my house, under the enormous plantain tree which\\r\\ncovers it, and shades and shelters the whole of it. I like this part of\\r\\nthe country and I am fond of living here because I am attached to it by\\r\\ndeep roots, profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil\\r\\non which his ancestors were born and died, which attach him to what\\r\\npeople think and what they eat, to the usages as well as to the food,\\r\\nlocal expressions, the peculiar language of the peasants, to the smell\\r\\nof the soil, of the villages and of the atmosphere itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love my house in which I grew up. From my windows I can see the Seine\\r\\nwhich flows by the side of my garden, on the other side of the road,\\r\\nalmost through my grounds, the great wide Seine, which goes to Rouen and\\r\\nHavre, and which is covered with boats passing to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left, down yonder, lies Rouen, that large town with its blue\\r\\nroofs, under its pointed, Gothic towers. They are innumerable, delicate\\r\\nor broad, dominated by the spire of the cathedral, and full of bells\\r\\nwhich sound through the blue air on fine mornings, sending their sweet\\r\\nand distant iron clang, to me; their metallic sound which the breeze\\r\\nwafts in my direction, now stronger and now weaker, according as the\\r\\nwind is stronger or lighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a delicious morning it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eleven o\\'clock, a long line of boats drawn by a steam-tug, as big\\r\\nas a fly, and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke,\\r\\npassed my gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two English schooners, whose red flag fluttered towards the sky,\\r\\nthere came a magnificent Brazilian three-master; it was perfectly white\\r\\nand wonderfully clean and shining. I saluted it, I hardly know why,\\r\\nexcept that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 12._ I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days, and\\r\\nI feel ill, or rather I feel low-spirited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence do these mysterious influences come, which change our happiness\\r\\ninto discouragement, and our self-confidence into diffidence? One might\\r\\nalmost say that the air, the invisible air, is full of unknowable\\r\\nForces, whose mysterious presence we have to endure. I wake up in the\\r\\nbest spirits, with an inclination to sing in my throat. Why? I go down\\r\\nby the side of the water, and suddenly, after walking a short distance,\\r\\nI return home wretched, as if some misfortune were awaiting me there.\\r\\nWhy? Is it a cold shiver which, passing over my skin, has upset my\\r\\nnerves and given me low spirits? Is it the form of the clouds, or the\\r\\ncolor of the sky, or the color of the surrounding objects which is so\\r\\nchangeable, which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my\\r\\neyes? Who can tell? Everything that surrounds us, everything that we see\\r\\nwithout looking at it, everything that we touch without knowing it,\\r\\neverything that we handle without feeling it, all that we meet without\\r\\nclearly distinguishing it, has a rapid, surprising and inexplicable\\r\\neffect upon us and upon our organs, and through them on our ideas and on\\r\\nour heart itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow profound that mystery of the Invisible is! We cannot fathom it with\\r\\nour miserable senses, with our eyes which are unable to perceive what is\\r\\neither too small or too great, too near to, or too far from us; neither\\r\\nthe inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water ... with our ears that\\r\\ndeceive us, for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air in\\r\\nsonorous notes. They are fairies who work the miracle of changing that\\r\\nmovement into noise, and by that metamorphosis give birth to music,\\r\\nwhich makes the mute agitation of nature musical ... with our sense of\\r\\nsmell which is smaller than that of a dog ... with our sense of taste\\r\\nwhich can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our\\r\\nfavor, what a number of fresh things we might discover around us!\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 16._ I am ill, decidedly! I was so well last month! I am feverish,\\r\\nhorribly feverish, or rather I am in a state of feverish enervation,\\r\\nwhich makes my mind suffer as much as my body. I have without ceasing\\r\\nthat horrible sensation of some danger threatening me, that apprehension\\r\\nof some coming misfortune or of approaching death, that presentiment\\r\\nwhich is, no doubt, an attack of some illness which is still unknown,\\r\\nwhich germinates in the flesh and in the blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 18._ I have just come from consulting my medical man, for I could\\r\\nno longer get any sleep. He found that my pulse was high, my eyes\\r\\ndilated, my nerves highly strung, but no alarming symptoms. I must have\\r\\na course of shower baths and of bromide of potassium.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 25._ No change! My state is really very peculiar. As the evening\\r\\ncomes on, an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me, just as\\r\\nif night concealed some terrible menace towards me. I dine quickly, and\\r\\nthen try to read, but I do not understand the words, and can scarcely\\r\\ndistinguish the letters. Then I walk up and down my drawing-room,\\r\\noppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear, the fear of\\r\\nsleep and fear of my bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten o\\'clock I go up to my room. As soon as I have got in I double\\r\\nlock, and bolt it: I am frightened ... of what? Up till the present time\\r\\nI have been frightened of nothing ... I open my cupboards, and look\\r\\nunder my bed; I listen ... I listen ... to what? How strange it is that\\r\\na simple feeling of discomfort, impeded or heightened circulation,\\r\\nperhaps the irritation of a nervous thread, a slight congestion, a small\\r\\ndisturbance in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living\\r\\nmachinery, can turn the most light-hearted of men into a melancholy one,\\r\\nand make a coward of the bravest? Then, I go to bed, and I wait for\\r\\nsleep as a man might wait for the executioner. I wait for its coming\\r\\nwith dread, and my heart beats and my legs tremble, while my whole body\\r\\nshivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes, until the moment when I\\r\\nsuddenly fall asleep, as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant\\r\\nwater in order to drown oneself. I do not feel as I used to do formerly,\\r\\nthis perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me, which is\\r\\ngoing to seize me by the head, to close my eyes and annihilate me,\\r\\ncoming over me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sleep--a long time--two or three hours perhaps--then a dream--no--a\\r\\nnightmare lays hold on me. I feel that I am in bed and asleep ... I feel\\r\\nit and I know it ... and I feel also that somebody is coming close to\\r\\nme, is looking at me, touching me, is getting on to my bed, is kneeling\\r\\non my chest, is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing it ...\\r\\nsqueezing it with all his might in order to strangle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI struggle, bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in\\r\\nour dreams; I try to cry out--but I cannot; I want to move--I cannot; I\\r\\ntry, with the most violent efforts and out of breath, to turn over and\\r\\nthrow off this being which is crushing and suffocating me--I cannot!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then suddenly, I wake up, shaken and bathed in perspiration; I light\\r\\na candle and find that I am alone, and after that crisis, which occurs\\r\\nevery night, I at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 2._ My state has grown worse. What is the matter with me? The\\r\\nbromide does me no good, and the shower baths have no effect whatever.\\r\\nSometimes, in order to tire myself out, though I am fatigued enough\\r\\nalready, I go for a walk in the forest of Roumare. I used to think at\\r\\nfirst that the fresh light and soft air, impregnated with the odor of\\r\\nherbs and leaves, would instill new blood into my veins and impart fresh\\r\\nenergy to my heart. I turned into a broad ride in the wood, and then I\\r\\nturned towards La Bouille, through a narrow path, between two rows of\\r\\nexceedingly tall trees, which placed a thick, green, almost black roof\\r\\nbetween the sky and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden shiver ran through me, not a cold shiver, but a shiver of\\r\\nagony, and so I hastened my steps, uneasy at being alone in the wood,\\r\\nfrightened stupidly and without reason, at the profound solitude.\\r\\nSuddenly it seemed to me as if I were being followed, that somebody was\\r\\nwalking at my heels, close, quite close to me, near enough to touch me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned round suddenly, but I was alone. I saw nothing behind me except\\r\\nthe straight, broad ride, empty and bordered by high trees, horribly\\r\\nempty; on the other side it also extended until it was lost in the\\r\\ndistance, and looked just the same, terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed my eyes. Why? And then I began to turn round on one heel very\\r\\nquickly, just like a top. I nearly fell down, and opened my eyes; the\\r\\ntrees were dancing round me and the earth heaved; I was obliged to sit\\r\\ndown. Then, ah! I no longer remembered how I had come! What a strange\\r\\nidea! What a strange, strange idea! I did not the least know. I started\\r\\noff to the right, and got back into the avenue which had led me into the\\r\\nmiddle of the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 3._ I have had a terrible night. I shall go away for a few weeks,\\r\\nfor no doubt a journey will set me up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 2._ I have come back, quite cured, and have had a most delightful\\r\\ntrip into the bargain. I have been to Mount Saint-Michel, which I had\\r\\nnot seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a sight, when one arrives as I did, at Avranches towards the end of\\r\\nthe day! The town stands on a hill, and I was taken into the public\\r\\ngarden at the extremity of the town. I uttered a cry of astonishment. An\\r\\nextraordinarily large bay lay extended before me, as far as my eyes\\r\\ncould reach, between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist; and\\r\\nin the middle of this immense yellow bay, under a clear, golden sky, a\\r\\npeculiar hill rose up, somber and pointed in the midst of the sand. The\\r\\nsun had just disappeared, and under the still flaming sky the outline\\r\\nof that fantastic rock stood out, which bears on its summit a fantastic\\r\\nmonument.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak I went to it. The tide was low as it had been the night\\r\\nbefore, and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as I approached\\r\\nit. After several hours walking, I reached the enormous mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich supports the little town, dominated by the great church. Having\\r\\nclimbed the steep and narrow street, I entered the most wonderful Gothic\\r\\nbuilding that has ever been built to God on earth, as large as a town,\\r\\nfull of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs, and lofty\\r\\ngalleries supported by delicate columns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of\\r\\nlace, covered with towers, with slender belfries to which spiral\\r\\nstaircases ascend, and which raise their strange heads that bristle with\\r\\nchimeras, with devils, with fantastic animals, with monstrous flowers,\\r\\nand which are joined together by finely carved arches, to the blue sky\\r\\nby day, and to the black sky by night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the summit, I said to the monk who accompanied me:\\r\\n\"Father, how happy you must be here!\" And he replied: \"It is very windy,\\r\\nMonsieur;\" and so we began to talk while watching the rising tide, which\\r\\nran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the monk told me stories, all the old stories belonging to the\\r\\nplace, legends, nothing but legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them struck me forcibly. The country people, those belonging to\\r\\nthe Mornet, declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the\\r\\nsand, and then that one hears two goats bleat, one with a strong, the\\r\\nother with a weak voice. Incredulous people declare that it is nothing\\r\\nbut the cry of the sea birds, which occasionally resembles bleatings,\\r\\nand occasionally human lamentations; but belated fishermen swear that\\r\\nthey have met an old shepherd, whose head, which is covered by his\\r\\ncloak, they can never see, wandering on the downs, between two tides,\\r\\nround the little town placed so far out of the world, and who is guiding\\r\\nand walking before them, a he-goat with a man\\'s face, and a she-goat\\r\\nwith a woman\\'s face, and both of them with white hair; and talking\\r\\nincessantly, quarreling in a strange language, and then suddenly ceasing\\r\\nto talk in order to bleat with all their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you believe it?\" I asked the monk. \"I scarcely know,\" he replied,\\r\\nand I continued: \"If there are other beings besides ourselves on this\\r\\nearth, how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time, or why\\r\\nhave you not seen them? How is it that I have not seen them?\" He\\r\\nreplied: \"Do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists? Look\\r\\nhere; there is the wind, which is the strongest force in nature, which\\r\\nknocks down men, and blows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea\\r\\ninto mountains of water, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the\\r\\nbreakers; the wind which kills, which whistles, which sighs, which\\r\\nroars,--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It exists for all\\r\\nthat, however.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was silent before this simple reasoning. That man was a philosopher,\\r\\nor perhaps a fool; I could not say which exactly, so I held my tongue.\\r\\nWhat he had said, had often been in my own thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 3._ I have slept badly; certainly there is some feverish influence\\r\\nhere, for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I am. When I went\\r\\nback home yesterday, I noticed his singular paleness, and I asked him:\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, Jean?\" \"The matter is that I never get any\\r\\nrest, and my nights devour my days. Since your departure, Monsieur,\\r\\nthere has been a spell over me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the other servants are all well, but I am very frightened of\\r\\nhaving another attack, myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 4._ I am decidedly taken again; for my old nightmares have\\r\\nreturned. Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my\\r\\nlife from between my lips with his mouth. Yes, he was sucking it out of\\r\\nmy neck, like a leech would have done. Then he got up, satiated, and I\\r\\nwoke up, so beaten, crushed and annihilated that I could not move. If\\r\\nthis continues for a few days, I shall certainly go away again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 5._ Have I lost my reason? What has happened, what I saw last\\r\\nnight is so strange, that my head wanders when I think of it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I do now every evening, I had locked my door, and then, being\\r\\nthirsty, I drank half a glass of water, and I accidentally noticed that\\r\\nthe water-bottle was full up to the cut-glass stopper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps, from which I\\r\\nwas aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes\\r\\nup with a knife in his chest, and who is rattling in his throat, covered\\r\\nwith blood, and who can no longer breathe and is going to die and does\\r\\nnot understand anything at all about it--there it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recovered my senses, I was thirsty again, so I lit a candle and\\r\\nwent to the table on which my water-bottle was. I lifted it up and\\r\\ntilted it over my glass, but nothing came out. It was empty! It was\\r\\ncompletely empty! At first I could not understand it at all, and then\\r\\nsuddenly I was seized by such a terrible feeling that I had to sit down,\\r\\nor rather I fell into a chair! Then I sprang up with a bound to look\\r\\nabout me, and then I sat down again, overcome by astonishment and fear,\\r\\nin front of the transparent crystal bottle! I looked at it with fixed\\r\\neyes, trying to conjecture, and my hands trembled! Somebody had drunk\\r\\nthe water, but who? I? I without any doubt. It could surely only be I?\\r\\nIn that case I was a somnambulist. I lived, without knowing it, that\\r\\ndouble mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not two\\r\\nbeings in us, or whether a strange, unknowable and invisible being does\\r\\nnot at such moments, when our soul is in a state of torpor, animate our\\r\\ncaptive body which obeys this other being, as it does us ourselves, and\\r\\nmore than it does ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! Who will understand my horrible agony? Who will understand the\\r\\nemotion of a man who is sound in mind, wide awake, full of sound sense,\\r\\nand who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has\\r\\ndisappeared while he was asleep, through the glass of a water-bottle!\\r\\nAnd I remained there until it was daylight, without venturing to go to\\r\\nbed again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 6._ I am going mad. Again all the contents of my water-bottle have\\r\\nbeen drunk during the night;--or rather, I have drunk it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is it I? Is it I? Who could it be? Who? Oh! God! Am I going mad? Who\\r\\nwill save me?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 10._ I have just been through some surprising ordeals. Decidedly I\\r\\nam mad! And yet!...\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, before going to bed, I put some wine, milk, water, bread and\\r\\nstrawberries on my table. Somebody drank--I drank--all the water and a\\r\\nlittle of the milk, but neither the wine, bread nor the strawberries\\r\\nwere touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment, with the same\\r\\nresults, and on July 8, I left out the water and the milk and nothing\\r\\nwas touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, on July 9 I put only water and milk on my table, taking care to\\r\\nwrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers. Then I\\r\\nrubbed my lips, my beard and my hands with pencil lead, and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrresistible sleep seized me, which was soon followed by a terrible\\r\\nawakening. I had not moved, and my sheets were not marked. I rushed to\\r\\nthe table. The muslin round the bottles remained intact; I undid the\\r\\nstring, trembling with fear. All the water had been drunk, and so had\\r\\nthe milk! Ah! Great God!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI must start for Paris immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 12._ Paris. I must have lost my head during the last few days! I\\r\\nmust be the plaything of my enervated imagination, unless I am really a\\r\\nsomnambulist, or that I have been brought under the power of one of\\r\\nthose influences which have been proved to exist, but which have\\r\\nhitherto been inexplicable, which are called suggestions. In any case,\\r\\nmy mental state bordered on madness, and twenty-four hours of Paris\\r\\nsufficed to restore me to my equilibrium.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which\\r\\ninstilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me, I wound up my\\r\\nevening at the _Théâtre-Français_. A play by Alexandre Dumas the\\r\\nYounger was being acted, and his active and powerful mind completed my\\r\\ncure. Certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds. We require men\\r\\nwho can think and can talk, around us. When we are alone for a long\\r\\ntime, we people space with phantoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits. Amid\\r\\nthe jostling of the crowd I thought, not without irony, of my terrors\\r\\nand surmises of the previous week, because I believed, yes, I believed,\\r\\nthat an invisible being lived beneath my roof. How weak our head is, and\\r\\nhow quickly it is terrified and goes astray, as soon as we are struck by\\r\\na small, incomprehensible fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of concluding with these simple words: \"I do not understand\\r\\nbecause the cause escapes me,\" we immediately imagine terrible mysteries\\r\\nand supernatural powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 14._ _Fête_ of the Republic. I walked through the streets, and the\\r\\ncrackers and flags amused me like a child. Still it is very foolish to\\r\\nbe merry on a fixed date, by a Government decree. The populace, an\\r\\nimbecile flock of sheep, now steadily patient, and now in ferocious\\r\\nrevolt. Say to it: \"Amuse yourself,\" and it amuses itself. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Go and fight with your neighbor,\" and it goes and fights. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Vote for the Emperor,\" and it votes for the Emperor, and then say to\\r\\nit: \"Vote for the Republic,\" and it votes for the Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who direct it are also stupid; but instead of obeying men, they\\r\\nobey principles, which can only be stupid, sterile and false, for the\\r\\nvery reason that they are principles, that is to say, ideas which are\\r\\nconsidered as certain and unchangeable, in this world where one is\\r\\ncertain of nothing, since light is an illusion and noise is an illusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 16._ I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was dining with my cousin Madame Sablé, whose husband is colonel of\\r\\nthe 76th Chasseurs at Limoges. There were two young women there, one of\\r\\nwhom had married a medical man, Dr. Parent, who devotes himself a great\\r\\ndeal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which\\r\\nat this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe related to us at some length the remarkable results obtained by\\r\\nEnglish scientists and the doctors of the medical school at Nancy, and\\r\\nthe facts which he adduced, appeared to me so strange, that I declared\\r\\nthat I was altogether incredulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are,\" he declared, \"on the point of discovering one of the most\\r\\nimportant secrets of nature, I mean to say, one of its most important\\r\\nsecrets on this earth, for there are certainly some which are of a\\r\\ndifferent kind of importance up in the stars, yonder. Ever since man has\\r\\nthought, since he has been able to express and write down his thoughts,\\r\\nhe has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable to his\\r\\ncoarse and imperfect senses, and he endeavors to supplement the want of\\r\\npower of his organs, by the efforts of his intellect. As long as that\\r\\nintellect still remained in its elementary stage, this intercourse with\\r\\ninvisible spirits, assumed forms which were commonplace though\\r\\nterrifying. Thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural, the\\r\\nlegends of wandering spirits, of fairies, of gnomes, ghosts, I might\\r\\neven say the legend of God, for our conceptions of the workman-creator,\\r\\nfrom whatever religion they may have come down to us, are certainly the\\r\\nmost mediocre, the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that\\r\\never sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures. Nothing is\\r\\ntruer than what Voltaire says: \\'God made man in His own image, but man\\r\\nhas certainly paid Him back again.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for rather more than a century, men seem to have had a presentiment\\r\\nof something new. Mesmer and some others have put us on an unexpected\\r\\ntrack, and especially within the last two or three years, we have\\r\\narrived at really surprising results.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who is also very incredulous, smiled, and Doctor Parent said\\r\\nto her: \"Would you like me to try and send you to sleep, Madame?\" \"Yes,\\r\\ncertainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in an easy-chair, and he began to look at her fixedly, so\\r\\nas to fascinate her. I suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable, with\\r\\na beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat. I saw that Madame\\r\\nSablé\\'s eyes were growing heavy, her mouth twitched and her bosom\\r\\nheaved, and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand behind her,\" the doctor said to me, and so I took a seat behind\\r\\nher. He put a visiting-card into her hands, and said to her: \"This is a\\r\\nlooking-glass; what do you see in it?\" And she replied: \"I see my\\r\\ncousin.\" \"What is he doing?\" \"He is twisting his moustache.\" \"And now?\"\\r\\n\"He is taking a photograph out of his pocket.\" \"Whose photograph is it?\"\\r\\n\"His own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was true, and that photograph had been given me that same evening\\r\\nat the hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is his attitude in this portrait?\" \"He is standing up with his hat\\r\\nin his hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she saw on that card, on that piece of white paste-board, as if she\\r\\nhad seen it in a looking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young women were frightened, and exclaimed: \"That is quite enough!\\r\\nQuite, quite enough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the doctor said to her authoritatively: \"You will get up at eight\\r\\no\\'clock to-morrow morning; then you will go and call on your cousin at\\r\\nhis hotel and ask him to lend you five thousands francs which your\\r\\nhusband demands of you, and which he will ask for when he sets out on\\r\\nhis coming journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn returning to my hotel, I thought over this curious _séance_ and I was\\r\\nassailed by doubts, not as to my cousin\\'s absolute and undoubted good\\r\\nfaith, for I had known her as well as if she had been my own sister ever\\r\\nsince she was a child, but as to a possible trick on the doctor\\'s part.\\r\\nHad not he, perhaps, kept a glass hidden in his hand, which he showed to\\r\\nthe young woman in her sleep, at the same time as he did the card?\\r\\nProfessional conjurors do things which are just as singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I went home and to bed, and this morning, at about half past eight, I\\r\\nwas awakened by my footman, who said to me: \"Madame Sablé has asked to\\r\\nsee you immediately, Monsieur,\" so I dressed hastily and went to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in some agitation, with her eyes on the floor, and without\\r\\nraising her veil she said to me: \"My dear cousin, I am going to ask a\\r\\ngreat favor of you.\" \"What is it, cousin?\" \"I do not like to tell you,\\r\\nand yet I must. I am in absolute want of five thousand francs.\" \"What,\\r\\nyou?\" \"Yes, I, or rather my husband, who has asked me to procure the\\r\\nmoney for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so stupefied that I stammered out my answers. I asked myself\\r\\nwhether she had not really been making fun of me with Doctor Parent, if\\r\\nit were not merely a very well-acted farce which had been got up\\r\\nbeforehand. On looking at her attentively, however, my doubts\\r\\ndisappeared. She was trembling with grief, so painful was this step to\\r\\nher, and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that she was very rich and so I continued: \"What! Has not your\\r\\nhusband five thousand francs at his disposal! Come, think. Are you sure\\r\\nthat he commissioned you to ask me for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated for a few seconds, as if she were making a great effort to\\r\\nsearch her memory, and then she replied: \"Yes ... yes, I am quite sure\\r\\nof it.\" \"He has written to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again and reflected, and I guessed the torture of her\\r\\nthoughts. She did not know. She only knew that she was to borrow five\\r\\nthousand francs of me for her husband. So she told a lie. \"Yes, he has\\r\\nwritten to me.\" \"When pray? You did not mention it to me yesterday.\" \"I\\r\\nreceived his letter this morning.\" \"Can you show it me?\" \"No; no ... no\\r\\n... it contained private matters ... things too personal to ourselves\\r\\n... I burnt it.\" \"So your husband runs into debt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again, and then murmured: \"I do not know.\" Thereupon I\\r\\nsaid bluntly: \"I have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this\\r\\nmoment, my dear cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a kind of a cry as if she were in pain and said: \"Oh! oh I\\r\\nbeseech you, I beseech you to get them for me....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me! I\\r\\nheard her voice change its tone; she wept and stammered, harassed and\\r\\ndominated by the irresistible order that she had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! oh! I beg you to ... if you knew what I am suffering.... I want\\r\\nthem to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had pity on her: \"You shall have them by and by, I swear to you.\" \"Oh!\\r\\nthank you! thank you! How kind you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI continued: \"Do you remember what took place at your house last night?\"\\r\\n\"Yes.\" \"Do you remember that Doctor Parent sent you to sleep?\" \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Very well then; he ordered you to come to me this morning to borrow\\r\\nfive thousand francs, and at this moment you are obeying that\\r\\nsuggestion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered for a few moments, and then replied: \"But as it is my\\r\\nhusband who wants them....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a whole hour I tried to convince her, but could not succeed, and\\r\\nwhen she had gone I went to the doctor. He was just going out, and he\\r\\nlistened to me with a smile, and said: \"Do you believe now?\" \"Yes, I\\r\\ncannot help it.\" \"Let us go to your cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was already dozing on a couch, overcome with fatigue. The doctor\\r\\nfelt her pulse, looked at her for some time with one hand raised towards\\r\\nher eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of\\r\\nthis magnetic influence, and when she was asleep, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer! You\\r\\nmust, therefore, forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you,\\r\\nand, if he speaks to you about it, you will not understand him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up, and I took out a pocketbook and said: \"Here is what\\r\\nyou asked me for this morning, my dear cousin.\" But she was so\\r\\nsurprised, that I did not venture to persist; nevertheless, I tried to\\r\\nrecall the circumstance to her, but she denied it vigorously, thought\\r\\nthat I was making fun of her, and in the end, very nearly lost her\\r\\ntemper.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere! I have just come back, and I have not been able to eat any lunch,\\r\\nfor this experiment has altogether upset me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 19._ Many people to whom I have told the adventure, have laughed\\r\\nat me. I no longer know what to think. The wise man says: Perhaps?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 21._ I dined at Bougival, and then I spent the evening at a\\r\\nboatmen\\'s ball. Decidedly everything depends on place and surroundings.\\r\\nIt would be the height of folly to believe in the supernatural on the\\r\\n_île de la Grenouillière_[15] ... but on the top of Mont\\r\\nSaint-Michel?... and in India? We are terribly under the influence of\\r\\nour surroundings. I shall return home next week.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 30._ I came back to my own house yesterday. Everything is going on\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 2._ Nothing new. It is splendid weather, and I spent my days in\\r\\nwatching the Seine flow past.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 4._ Quarrels among my servants. They declare that the glasses\\r\\nare broken in the cupboards at night. The footman accuses the cook, who\\r\\naccuses the needle woman, who accuses the other two. Who is the culprit?\\r\\nA clever person, to be able to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 6._ This time, I am not mad. I have seen ... I have seen ... I\\r\\nhave seen!... I can doubt no longer ... I have seen it!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI was walking at two o\\'clock among my rose trees, in the full sunlight\\r\\n... in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall. As\\r\\nI stopped to look at a _Géant de Bataille_, which had three splendid\\r\\nblooms, I distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend, close to\\r\\nme, as if an invisible hand had bent it, and then break, as if that hand\\r\\nhad picked it! Then the flower raised itself, following the curve which\\r\\na hand would have described in carrying it towards a mouth, and it\\r\\nremained suspended in the transparent air, all alone and motionless, a\\r\\nterrible red spot, three yards from my eyes. In desperation I rushed at\\r\\nit to take it! I found nothing; it had disappeared. Then I was seized\\r\\nwith furious rage against myself, for it is not allowable for a\\r\\nreasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was it a hallucination? I turned round to look for the stalk, and I\\r\\nfound it immediately under the bush, freshly broken, between two other\\r\\nroses which remained on the branch, and I returned home then, with a\\r\\nmuch disturbed mind; for I am certain now, as certain as I am of the\\r\\nalternation of day and night, that there exists close to me an invisible\\r\\nbeing that lives on milk and on water, which can touch objects, take\\r\\nthem and change their places; which is, consequently, endowed with a\\r\\nmaterial nature, although it is imperceptible to our senses, and which\\r\\nlives as I do, under my roof....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 7._ I slept tranquilly. He drank the water out of my decanter,\\r\\nbut did not disturb my sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask myself whether I am mad. As I was walking just now in the sun by\\r\\nthe river side, doubts as to my own sanity arose in me; not vague doubts\\r\\nsuch as I have had hitherto, but precise and absolute doubts. I have\\r\\nseen mad people, and I have known some who have been quite intelligent,\\r\\nlucid, even clear-sighted in every concern of life, except on one point.\\r\\nThey spoke clearly, readily, profoundly on everything, when suddenly\\r\\ntheir thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and broke to\\r\\npieces there, and were dispersed and foundered in that furious and\\r\\nterrible sea, full of bounding waves, fogs and squalls, which is called\\r\\n_madness_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI certainly should think that I was mad, absolutely mad, if I were not\\r\\nconscious, did not perfectly know my state, if I did not fathom it by\\r\\nanalyzing it with the most complete lucidity. I should, in fact, be a\\r\\nreasonable man who was laboring under a hallucination. Some unknown\\r\\ndisturbance must have been excited in my brain, one of those\\r\\ndisturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to\\r\\nfix precisely, and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in\\r\\nmy mind and in the order and logic of my ideas. Similar phenomena occur\\r\\nin the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria,\\r\\nwithout causing us any surprise, because our verifying apparatus and our\\r\\nsense of control has gone to sleep, while our imaginative faculty wakes\\r\\nand works. Is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the\\r\\ncerebral finger-board has been paralyzed in me? Some men lose the\\r\\nrecollection of proper names, or of verbs or of numbers or merely of\\r\\ndates, in consequence of an accident. The localization of all the\\r\\nparticles of thought has been proved nowadays; what then would there be\\r\\nsurprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of\\r\\ncertain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being!\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water. The sun was\\r\\nshining brightly on the river and made earth delightful, while it filled\\r\\nmy looks with love for life, for the swallows, whose agility is always\\r\\ndelightful in my eyes, for the plants by the riverside, whose rustling\\r\\nis a pleasure to my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees, however, an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me. It\\r\\nseemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me, were\\r\\npreventing me from going further and were calling me back. I felt that\\r\\npainful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a beloved\\r\\ninvalid at home, and when you are seized by a presentiment that he is\\r\\nworse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, returned in spite of myself, feeling certain that I should\\r\\nfind some bad news awaiting me, a letter or a telegram. There was\\r\\nnothing, however, and I was more surprised and uneasy than if I had had\\r\\nanother fantastic vision.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 8._ I spent a terrible evening, yesterday. He does not show\\r\\nhimself any more, but I feel that he is near me, watching me, looking at\\r\\nme, penetrating me, dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides\\r\\nhimself thus, than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible\\r\\npresence by supernatural phenomena. However, I slept.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 9._ Nothing, but I am afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 10._ Nothing; what will happen to-morrow?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 11._ Still nothing; I cannot stop at home with this fear hanging\\r\\nover me and these thoughts in my mind; I shall go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 12._ Ten o\\'clock at night. All day long I have been trying to\\r\\nget away, and have not been able. I wished to accomplish this simple and\\r\\neasy act of liberty--go out--get into my carriage in order to go to\\r\\nRouen--and I have not been able to do it. What is the reason?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 13._ When one is attacked by certain maladies, all the springs\\r\\nof our physical being appear to be broken, all our energies destroyed,\\r\\nall our muscles relaxed, our bones to have become as soft as our flesh,\\r\\nand our blood as liquid as water. I am experiencing that condition in my\\r\\nmoral being in a strange and distressing manner. I have no longer any\\r\\nstrength, any courage, any self-control, nor even any power to set my\\r\\nown will in motion. I have no power left to _will_ anything, but some\\r\\none does it for me and I obey.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 14._ I am lost! Somebody possesses my soul and governs it!\\r\\nSomebody orders all my acts, all my movements, all my thoughts. I am no\\r\\nlonger anything in myself, nothing except an enslaved and terrified\\r\\nspectator of all the things which I do. I wish to go out; I cannot. He\\r\\ndoes not wish to, and so I remain, trembling and distracted in the\\r\\narmchair in which he keeps me sitting. I merely wish to get up and to\\r\\nrouse myself, so as to think that I am still master of myself: I cannot!\\r\\nI am riveted to my chair, and my chair adheres to the ground in such a\\r\\nmanner that no force could move us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly, I must, I must go to the bottom of my garden to pick some\\r\\nstrawberries and eat them, and I go there. I pick the strawberries and I\\r\\neat them! Oh! my God! my God! Is there a God? If there be one, deliver\\r\\nme! save me! succor me! Pardon! Pity! Mercy! Save me! Oh! what\\r\\nsufferings! what torture! what horror!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 15._ Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was\\r\\npossessed and swayed, when she came to borrow five thousand francs of\\r\\nme. She was under the power of a strange will which had entered into\\r\\nher, like another soul, like another parasitic and ruling soul. Is the\\r\\nworld coming to an end?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who is he, this invisible being that rules me. This unknowable\\r\\nbeing, this rover of a supernatural race?\\r\\n\\r\\nInvisible beings exist, then! How is it then that since the beginning of\\r\\nthe world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner\\r\\nprecisely as they do to me? I have never read anything which resembles\\r\\nwhat goes on in my house. Oh! If I could only leave it, if I could only\\r\\ngo away and flee, so as never to return. I should be saved, but I\\r\\ncannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 16._ I managed to escape to-day for two hours, like a prisoner\\r\\nwho finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open. I suddenly felt\\r\\nthat I was free and that he was far away, and so I gave orders to put\\r\\nthe horses in as quickly as possible, and I drove to Rouen. Oh! How\\r\\ndelightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you: \"Go to Rouen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI made him pull up before the library, and I begged them to lend me Dr.\\r\\nHerrmann Herestauss\\'s treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient\\r\\nand modern world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting into my carriage, I intended to say: \"To the\\r\\nrailway station!\" but instead of this I shouted,--I did not say, but I\\r\\nshouted--in such a loud voice that all the passers-by turned round:\\r\\n\"Home!\" and I fell back onto the cushion of my carriage, overcome by\\r\\nmental agony. He had found me out and regained possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 17._ Oh! What a night! what a night! And yet it seems to me that\\r\\nI ought to rejoice. I read until one o\\'clock in the morning! Herestauss,\\r\\nDoctor of Philosophy and Theogony, wrote the history and the\\r\\nmanifestations of all those invisible beings which hover around man, or\\r\\nof whom he dreams. He describes their origin, their domains, their\\r\\npower; but none of them resembles the one which haunts me. One might say\\r\\nthat man, ever since he has thought, has had a foreboding of, and feared\\r\\na new being, stronger than himself, his successor in this world, and\\r\\nthat, feeling him near, and not being able to foretell the nature of\\r\\nthat master, he has, in his terror, created the whole race of hidden\\r\\nbeings, of vague phantoms born of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving, therefore, read until one o\\'clock in the morning, I went and sat\\r\\ndown at the open window, in order to cool my forehead and my thoughts,\\r\\nin the calm night air. It was very pleasant and warm! How I should have\\r\\nenjoyed such a night formerly!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no moon, but the stars darted out their rays in the dark\\r\\nheavens. Who inhabits those worlds? What forms, what living beings, what\\r\\nanimals are there yonder? What do those who are thinkers in those\\r\\ndistant worlds, know more than we do? What can they do more than we can?\\r\\nWhat do they see which we do not know? Will not one of them, some day or\\r\\nother, traversing space, appear on our earth to conquer it, just as the\\r\\nNorsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations more\\r\\nfeeble than themselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are so weak, so unarmed, so ignorant, so small, we who live on this\\r\\nparticle of mud which turns round in a drop of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell asleep, dreaming thus in the cool night air, and then, having\\r\\nslept for about three quarters of an hour, I opened my eyes without\\r\\nmoving, awakened by I know not what confused and strange sensation. At\\r\\nfirst I saw nothing, and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page of\\r\\na book which had remained open on my table, turned over of its own\\r\\naccord. Not a breath of air had come in at my window, and I was\\r\\nsurprised and waited. In about four minutes, I saw, I saw, yes I saw\\r\\nwith my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the\\r\\nothers, as if a finger had turned it over. My armchair was empty,\\r\\nappeared empty, but I knew that he was there, he, and sitting in my\\r\\nplace, and that he was reading. With a furious bound, the bound of an\\r\\nenraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer, I crossed my\\r\\nroom to seize him, to strangle him, to kill him!... But before I could\\r\\nreach it, my chair fell over as if somebody had ran away from me ... my\\r\\ntable rocked, my lamp fell and went out, and my window closed as if some\\r\\nthief had been surprised and had fled out into the night, shutting it\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he had run away: he had been afraid: he, afraid of me!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ... so ... to-morrow ... or later ... some day or other ... I should\\r\\nbe able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground! Do\\r\\nnot dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 18._ I have been thinking the whole day long. Oh! yes, I will\\r\\nobey him, follow his impulses, fulfill all his wishes, show myself\\r\\nhumble, submissive, a coward. He is the stronger; but an hour will\\r\\ncome....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I know, ... I know ... I know all! I have just read the\\r\\nfollowing in the _Revue du Monde Scientifique_: \"A curious piece of news\\r\\ncomes to us from Rio de Janeiro. Madness, an epidemic of madness, which\\r\\nmay be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the people of\\r\\nEurope in the Middle Ages, is at this moment raging in the Province of\\r\\nSan-Paulo. The frightened inhabitants are leaving their houses,\\r\\ndeserting their villages, abandoning their land, saying that they are\\r\\npursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by invisible, though\\r\\ntangible beings, a species of vampire, which feed on their life while\\r\\nthey are asleep, and who, besides, drink water and milk without\\r\\nappearing to touch any other nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Professor Don Pedro Henriques, accompanied by several medical savants,\\r\\nhas gone to the Province of San-Paulo, in order to study the origin and\\r\\nthe manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot, and to\\r\\npropose such measures to the Emperor as may appear to him to be most\\r\\nfitted to restore the mad population to reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! Ah! I remember now that fine Brazilian three-master which passed in\\r\\nfront of my windows as it was going up the Seine, on the 8th of last\\r\\nMay! I thought it looked so pretty, so white and bright! That Being was\\r\\non board of her, coming from there, where its race sprang from. And it\\r\\nsaw me! It saw my house which was also white, and he sprang from the\\r\\nship onto the land. Oh! Good heavens!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I know, I can divine. The reign of man is over, and he has come. He\\r\\nwhom disquieted priests exorcised, whom sorcerers evoked on dark nights,\\r\\nwithout yet seeing him appear, to whom the presentiments of the\\r\\ntransient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful forms\\r\\nof gnomes, spirits, genii, fairies and familiar spirits. After the\\r\\ncoarse conceptions of primitive fear, more clear-sighted men foresaw it\\r\\nmore clearly. Mesmer divined him, and ten years ago physicians\\r\\naccurately discovered the nature of his power, even before he exercised\\r\\nit himself. They played with that weapon of their new Lord, the sway of\\r\\na mysterious will over the human soul, which had become enslaved. They\\r\\ncalled it magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion ... what do I know? I have\\r\\nseen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this horrible\\r\\npower! Woe to us! Woe to man! He has come, the ... the ... what does he\\r\\ncall himself ... the ... I fancy that he is shouting out his name to me\\r\\nand I do not hear him ... the ... yes ... he is shouting it out ... I am\\r\\nlistening ... I cannot ... repeat ... it ... Horla ... I have heard ...\\r\\nthe Horla, ... it is he ... the Horla ... he has come!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! the vulture has eaten the pigeon, the wolf has eaten the lamb; the\\r\\nlion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns; man has killed the lion\\r\\nwith an arrow, with a sword, with gunpowder; but the Horla will make of\\r\\nman what we have made of the horse and of the ox: his chattel, his slave\\r\\nand his food, by the mere of his will. Woe to us!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, nevertheless, the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who\\r\\nhas subjugated it.... I should also like ... I shall be able to ... but\\r\\nI must know him, touch him, see him! Learned men say that beasts\\' eyes,\\r\\nas they differ from ours, do not distinguish like ours do.... And my eye\\r\\ncannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Oh! Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont Saint-Michel: \"Can\\r\\nwe see the hundred-thousandth part of what exists? Look here; there is\\r\\nthe wind which is the strongest force in nature, which knocks men, and\\r\\nblows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea into mountains of\\r\\nwater, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers; the wind\\r\\nwhich kills, which whistles, which sighs, which roars,--have you ever\\r\\nseen it, and can you see it? It exists for all that, however!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I went on thinking: my eyes are so weak, so imperfect, that they do\\r\\nnot even distinguish hard bodies, if they are as transparent as\\r\\nglass!... If a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way, I\\r\\nshould run into it, just like a bird which has flown into a room breaks\\r\\nits head against the windowpanes. A thousand things, moreover, deceive\\r\\nhim and lead him astray. How should it then be surprising that he cannot\\r\\nperceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new being! Why not? It was assuredly bound to come! Why should we be\\r\\nthe last? We do not distinguish it, like all the others created before\\r\\nus? The reason is, that its nature is more perfect, its body finer and\\r\\nmore finished than ours, that ours is so weak, so awkwardly conceived,\\r\\nencumbered with organs that are always tired, always on the strain like\\r\\nlocks that are too complicated, which lives like a plant and like a\\r\\nbeast, nourishing itself with difficulty on air, herbs and flesh, an\\r\\nanimal machine, which is a prey to maladies, to malformations, to decay;\\r\\nbroken-winded, badly regulated, simple and eccentric, ingeniously badly\\r\\nmade, a coarse and a delicate work, the outline of a being which might\\r\\nbecome intelligent and grand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are only a few, so few in this world, from the oyster up to man. Why\\r\\nshould there not be one more, when once that period is accomplished\\r\\nwhich separates the successive apparitions from all the different\\r\\nspecies?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not one more? Why not, also, other trees with immense, splendid\\r\\nflowers, perfuming whole regions? Why not other elements besides fire,\\r\\nair, earth and water? There are four, only four, those nursing fathers\\r\\nof various beings! What a pity! Why are they not forty, four hundred,\\r\\nfour thousand! How poor everything is, how mean and wretched! grudgingly\\r\\ngiven, dryly invented, clumsily made! Ah! the elephant and the\\r\\nhippopotamus, what grace! And the camel, what elegance!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, the butterfly you will say, a flying flower! I dream of one that\\r\\nshould be as large as a hundred worlds, with wings whose shape, beauty,\\r\\ncolors and motion I cannot even express. But I see it ... it flutters\\r\\nfrom star to star, refreshing them and perfuming them with the light and\\r\\nharmonious breath of its flight!... And the people up there look at it\\r\\nas it passes in an ecstacy of delight!...\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the matter with me? It is he, the Horla, who haunts me, and who\\r\\nmakes me think of these foolish things! He is within me, he is becoming\\r\\nmy soul; I shall kill him!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I shall kill him. I have seen him! Yesterday I sat down at\\r\\nmy table and pretended to write very assiduously. I knew quite well that\\r\\nhe would come prowling round me, quite close to me, so close that I\\r\\nmight perhaps be able to touch him, to seize him. And then!... then I\\r\\nshould have the strength of desperation; I should have my hands, my\\r\\nknees, my chest, my forehead, my teeth to strangle him, to crush him, to\\r\\nbite him, to tear him to pieces. And I watched for him with all my\\r\\noverexcited organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece,\\r\\nas if, by this light, I could have discovered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy bed, my old oak bed with its columns was opposite to me; on my right\\r\\nwas the fireplace; on my left the door, which was carefully closed,\\r\\nafter I had left it open for some time, in order to attract him; behind\\r\\nme was a very high wardrobe with a looking-glass in it, which served me\\r\\nto dress by every day, and in which I was in the habit of looking at\\r\\nmyself from head to foot every time I passed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I pretended to be writing in order to deceive him, for he also was\\r\\nwatching me, and suddenly I felt, I was certain that he was reading over\\r\\nmy shoulder, that he was there, almost touching my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got up so quickly, with my hands extended, that I almost fell. Eh!\\r\\nwell?... It was as bright as at midday, but I did not see myself in the\\r\\nglass!... It was empty, clear, profound, full of light! But my figure\\r\\nwas not reflected in it ... and I, I was opposite to it! I saw the\\r\\nlarge, clear glass from top to bottom, and I looked at it with unsteady\\r\\neyes; and I did not dare to advance; I did not venture to make a\\r\\nmovement, nevertheless, feeling perfectly that he was there, but that he\\r\\nwould escape me again, he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow frightened I was! And then suddenly I began to see myself through a\\r\\nmist in the depths of the looking-glass, in a mist as it were through a\\r\\nsheet of water; and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing slowly\\r\\nfrom left to right, and making my figure clearer every moment. It was\\r\\nlike the end of an eclipse. Whatever it was that hid me, did not appear\\r\\nto possess any clearly defined outlines, but a sort of opaque\\r\\ntransparency, which gradually grew clearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I was able to distinguish myself completely, as I do every day\\r\\nwhen I look at myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen it! And the horror of it remained with me, and makes me\\r\\nshudder even now.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 20._ How could I kill it, as I could not get hold of it? Poison?\\r\\nBut it would see me mix it with the water; and then, would our poisons\\r\\nhave any effect on its impalpable body? No ... no ... no doubt about the\\r\\nmatter ... Then? ... then?...\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 21._ I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen, and ordered iron\\r\\nshutters of him for my room, such as some private hotels in Paris have\\r\\non the ground floor, for fear of thieves, and he is going to make me a\\r\\nsimilar door as well. I have made myself out as a coward, but I do not\\r\\ncare about that!...\\r\\n\\r\\n_September 10._ Rouen, Hotel Continental. It is done; ... it is\\r\\ndone.... But is he dead? My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, then, yesterday, the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and\\r\\ndoor, I left everything open until midnight, although it was getting\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I felt that he was there, and joy, mad joy took possession of\\r\\nme. I got up softly, and I walked to the right and left for sometime, so\\r\\nthat he might not guess anything; then I took off my boots and put on my\\r\\nslippers carelessly; then I fastened the iron shutters and going back to\\r\\nthe door quickly I double-locked it with a padlock, putting the key into\\r\\nmy pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed that he was moving restlessly round me, that in his\\r\\nturn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out. I nearly\\r\\nyielded, though I did not yet, but putting my back to the door, I half\\r\\nopened, just enough to allow me to go out backwards, and as I am very\\r\\ntall, my head touched the lintel. I was sure that he had not been able\\r\\nto escape, and I shut him up quite alone, quite alone. What happiness! I\\r\\nhad him fast. Then I ran downstairs; in the drawing-room, which was\\r\\nunder my bedroom, I took the two lamps and I poured all the oil onto the\\r\\ncarpet, the furniture, everywhere; then I set the fire to it and made my\\r\\nescape, after having carefully double-locked the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden, in a clump of laurel\\r\\nbushes. How long it was! how long it was! Everything was dark, silent,\\r\\nmotionless, not a breath of air and not a star, but heavy banks of\\r\\nclouds which one could not see, but which weighed, oh! so heavily on my\\r\\nsoul.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at my house and waited. How long it was! I already began to\\r\\nthink that the fire had gone out of its own accord, or that he had\\r\\nextinguished it, when one of the lower windows gave way under the\\r\\nviolence of the flames, and a long, soft, caressing sheet of red flame\\r\\nmounted up the white wall, and kissed it as high as the roof. The light\\r\\nfell onto the trees, the branches, and the leaves, and a shiver of fear\\r\\npervaded them also! The birds awoke; a dog began to howl, and it seemed\\r\\nto me as if the day were breaking! Almost immediately two other windows\\r\\nflew into fragments, and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my\\r\\nhouse was nothing but a terrible furnace. But a cry, a horrible, shrill,\\r\\nheartrending cry, a woman\\'s cry, sounded through the night, and two\\r\\ngarret windows were opened! I had forgotten the servants! I saw the\\r\\nterror-struck faces, and their frantically waving arms!...\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, overwhelmed with horror, I set off to run to the village,\\r\\nshouting: \"Help! help! fire! fire!\" I met some people who were already\\r\\ncoming onto the scene, and I went back with them to see!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the house was nothing but a horrible and a magnificent\\r\\nfuneral pile, a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country, a\\r\\nfuneral pile where men were burning, and where he was burning also, He,\\r\\nHe, my prisoner, that new Being, the new master, the Horla!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls, and a volcano of\\r\\nflames darted up to the sky. Through all the windows which opened onto\\r\\nthat furnace, I saw the flames darting, and I thought that he was there,\\r\\nin that kiln, dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead? perhaps?... His body? Was not his body, which was transparent,\\r\\nindestructible by such means as would kill ours?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he was not dead?... Perhaps time alone has power over that Invisible\\r\\nand Redoubtable Being. Why this transparent, unrecognizable body, this\\r\\nbody belonging to a spirit, if it also had to fear ills, infirmities and\\r\\npremature destruction?\\r\\n\\r\\nPremature destruction? All human terror springs from that! After man the\\r\\nHorla. After him who can die every day, at any hour, at any moment, by\\r\\nany accident, he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and\\r\\nminute, because he had touched the limits of his existence!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo ... no ... without any doubt ... he is not dead.... Then ... then ...\\r\\nI suppose I must kill myself!...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOVE\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE PAGES FROM A SPORTSMAN\\'S BOOK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just read among the General News in one of the papers, a drama of\\r\\npassion. He killed her and then he killed himself, so he must have loved\\r\\nher. What matter He or She? Their love alone matters to me; and it does\\r\\nnot interest me because it moves me or astonishes me, or because it\\r\\nsoftens me or makes me think, but because it recalls to my mind a\\r\\nremembrance of my youth, a strange recollection of a hunting adventure\\r\\nwhere Love appeared to me, as the Cross appeared to the early\\r\\nChristians, in the midst of the heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born with all the instincts and the senses of primitive man,\\r\\ntempered by the arguments and the feelings of a civilized being. I am\\r\\npassionately fond of shooting, and the sight of the bleeding animal,\\r\\nwith the blood on its feathers and on my hands, affect my heart so, as\\r\\nalmost to make it stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year the cold weather set in suddenly towards the end of autumn,\\r\\nand I was invited by one of my cousins, Karl de Rauville, to go with him\\r\\nand shoot ducks on the marshes, at daybreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who was a jolly fellow of forty, with red hair, very stout\\r\\nand bearded, a country gentleman, an amiable semi-brute, of a happy\\r\\ndisposition and endowed with that Gallic wit which makes even mediocrity\\r\\nagreeable, lived in a house, half farmhouse, half château, situated in\\r\\na broad valley through which a river ran. The hills right and left were\\r\\ncovered with woods, old seignorial woods where magnificent trees still\\r\\nremained, and where the rarest feathered game in that part of France was\\r\\nto be found. Eagles were shot there occasionally, and birds of passage,\\r\\nthose which rarely come into our over-populated part of the country,\\r\\nalmost infallibly stopped amid these branches, which were centuries old,\\r\\nas if they knew or recognized a little corner of a forest of ancient\\r\\ntimes which had remained there to serve them as a shelter during their\\r\\nshort nocturnal halting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the valley there were large meadows watered by trenches and separated\\r\\nby hedges; then, further on the river, which up to that point had been\\r\\ncanalized, expanded into a vast marsh. That marsh, which was the best\\r\\nshooting ground which I ever saw, was my cousin\\'s chief care, who kept\\r\\nit like a park. Among the number of rushes that covered it, and made it\\r\\nliving, rustling and rough, narrow passages had been made, through which\\r\\nthe flat-bottomed boats, which were impelled and steered by poles,\\r\\npassed along silently over the dead water, brushed up against the reeds\\r\\nand made the swift fish take refuge among the weeds, and the wild fowl\\r\\ndive, whose pointed, black heads disappeared suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am passionately fond of the water; the sea, although it is too vast,\\r\\ntoo full of movement, impossible to hold, the rivers, which are so\\r\\nbeautiful, but which pass on, flee away and go, and above all the\\r\\nmarshes, where the whole unknown existence of aquatic animals\\r\\npalpitates. The marsh is an entire world to itself on earth, a different\\r\\nworld which has its own life, its settled inhabitants and its passing\\r\\ntravelers, its voices, its noises, and above all its mystery. Nothing is\\r\\nmore disturbing, nothing, more disquieting, more terrifying\\r\\noccasionally, than a fen. Why should this terror hang over these low\\r\\nplains covered with water? Is it the vague rustling of the rushes, the\\r\\nstrange Will-o\\'-the-wisps, the profound silence which envelops them on\\r\\ncalm nights, or is it the strange mists, which hang over the rushes like\\r\\na shroud; or else it is the imperceptible splashing, so slight and so\\r\\ngentle, and sometimes more terrifying than the cannons of men or the\\r\\nthunders of skies, which make these marshes resemble countries which\\r\\nnone has dreamed of, terrible countries concealing an unknown and\\r\\ndangerous secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, something else belongs to it, another mystery, more profound and\\r\\ngraver floats amid these thick mists, perhaps the mystery of the\\r\\ncreation itself! For was it not in stagnant and muddy water, amid the\\r\\nheavy humidity of moist land under the heat of the sun, that the first\\r\\ngerm of life vibrated and expanded to the day?\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived at my cousin\\'s in the evening. It was freezing hard enough to\\r\\nsplit stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, in the large room whose sideboards, walls and ceilings\\r\\nwere covered with stuffed birds, with extended wings or perched on\\r\\nbranches to which they were nailed, hawks, herons, owls, nightjars,\\r\\nbuzzards, tiercels, vultures, falcons, my cousin, who himself resembled\\r\\nsome strange animal from a cold country, dressed in a sealskin jacket,\\r\\ntold me what preparations he had made for that same night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to start at half past three in the morning, so as to arrive at\\r\\nthe place which he had chosen for our watching place at about half past\\r\\nfour. On that spot a hut had been built of lumps of ice, so as to\\r\\nshelter us somewhat from the terrible wind which precedes daybreak, that\\r\\nwind which is so cold that it tears the flesh as if with a saw, cuts it\\r\\nlike the blade of a knife and pricks it like a poisoned sting, twists it\\r\\nlike a pair of pincers, and burns it like fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin rubbed his hands: \"I have never known such a frost,\" he said;\\r\\n\"it is already twelve degrees below zero at six o\\'clock in the evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI threw myself onto my bed immediately after we had finished our meal,\\r\\nand I went to sleep by the light of a bright fire burning in the grate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o\\'clock he woke me. In my turn, I put on a sheepskin, and I\\r\\nfound my cousin Karl covered with a bearskin. After having each of us\\r\\nswallowed two cups of scalding coffee, followed by glasses of liqueur\\r\\nbrandy, we started, accompanied by a gamekeeper and our dogs, Plongeon\\r\\nand Pierrot.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first moment that I got outside, I felt chilled to the very\\r\\nmarrow. It was one of those nights on which the earth seems dead with\\r\\ncold. The frozen air becomes resisting and palpable, such pain does it\\r\\ncause; no breath of wind moves it, it is fixed and motionless; it bites,\\r\\npierces through you, dries, kills the trees, the plants, the insects,\\r\\nthe small birds themselves that fall from the branches onto the hard\\r\\nground, and become hard themselves under the grip of the cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon, which was in her last quarter and was inclining all to one\\r\\nside, seemed fainting in the midst of space, and so weak that she did\\r\\nnot seem able to take her departure, and so she remained up yonder, also\\r\\nseized and paralyzed by the severity of the weather. She shed a\\r\\ncold, mournful light over the world, that dying and wan light which she\\r\\ngives us every month, at the end of her resurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl and I went side by side, our backs bent, our hands in our pockets\\r\\nand our guns under our arms. Our boots, which were wrapped in wool, so\\r\\nthat we might be able to walk without slipping on the frozen river, made\\r\\nno sound, and I looked at the white vapor which our dogs\\' breath made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon on the edge of the marsh, and we went into one of these\\r\\nlanes of dry rushes which ran through this low forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur elbows, which touched the long, ribbonlike leaves, left a slight\\r\\nnoise behind us, and I was seized, as I had never been before, by the\\r\\npowerful singular emotion which marshes cause in me. This one was dead,\\r\\ndead from cold, since we were walking on it, in the middle of its\\r\\npopulation of dried rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, at the turn of one of the lanes, I perceived the ice-hut which\\r\\nhad been constructed to shelter us. I went in, and as we had nearly an\\r\\nhour to wait before the wandering birds would awake, I rolled myself up\\r\\nin my rug in order to try and get warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, lying on my back, I began to look at the misshapen moon, which had\\r\\nfour horns, through the vaguely transparent walls of this polar house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the frost of the frozen marshes, the cold of these walls, the cold\\r\\nfrom the firmament penetrated me so terribly, that I began to cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin Karl became uneasy. \"So much the worse if we do not kill much\\r\\nto-day,\" he said, \"I do not want you to catch cold; we will light a\\r\\nfire.\" And he told the gamekeeper to cut some rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made a pile in the middle of our hut, which had a hole in the middle\\r\\nof the roof to let out the smoke, and when the red flames rose up to the\\r\\nclear, crystal cloisons they began to melt, gently, imperceptibly, as if\\r\\nthese stones of ice had sweated. Karl, who had remained outside, called\\r\\nout to me: \"Come and look here!\" I went out of the hut and remained,\\r\\nstruck with astonishment. Our hut, in the shape of a cone, looked like\\r\\nan enormous diamond with a heart of fire, which had been suddenly\\r\\nplanted there in the midst of the frozen water of the marsh. And inside\\r\\nwe saw two fantastic forms, those of our dogs, who were warming\\r\\nthemselves at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a peculiar cry, a lost, a wandering cry, passed over our heads, and\\r\\nthe light from our hearth showed us the wild birds. Nothing moves one so\\r\\nmuch as the first clamor of life which one does not see, and which is\\r\\npassing through the somber air so quickly and so far off, before the\\r\\nfirst streak of the winter\\'s day appears on the horizon. It seems to me\\r\\nat this glacial hour of dawn, as if that passing cry which is carried\\r\\naway by the wings of a bird, is the sigh of a soul from the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put out the fire,\" Karl said. \"It is getting daylight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was, in fact, beginning to grow pale, and the flights of ducks\\r\\nmade long, rapid spots, which were soon obliterated, on the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stream of light burst out into the night; Karl had fired, and the two\\r\\ndogs ran forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, nearly every minute, now he, now I, aimed rapidly as soon as\\r\\nthe shadow of a flying flock appeared above the rushes. And Pierrot and\\r\\nPlongeon, out of breath but happy, retrieved the bleeding birds for us,\\r\\nwhose eyes still, occasionally, looked at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had risen, and it was a bright day with a blue sky, and we were\\r\\nthinking of taking our departure, when two birds with extended necks and\\r\\noutstretched wings, glided rapidly over our heads. I fired, and one of\\r\\nthem fell almost at my feet. It was a teal, with a silver breast, and\\r\\nthen, in the blue space above me, I heard a voice, the voice of a bird.\\r\\nIt was a short, repeated, heartrending lament; and the bird, the little\\r\\nanimal that had been spared began to turn round in the blue sky, over\\r\\nour heads, looking at its dead companion which I was holding in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl was on his knees, his gun to his shoulder watching it eagerly,\\r\\nuntil it should be within shot. \"You have killed the duck,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and the drake will not fly away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly did not fly away; he turned round over our heads\\r\\ncontinually, and continued his cries. Never have any groans of suffering\\r\\npained me so much as that desolate appeal, as that lamentable reproach\\r\\nof this poor bird which was lost in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally he took a flight under the menace of the gun which followed\\r\\nhis flight, and seemed ready to continue his flight alone, but as he\\r\\ncould not make up his mind to this, he soon returned to find his mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave her on the ground,\" Karl said to me, \"he will come within shot by\\r\\nand by.\" And he did indeed come near us, careless of danger, infatuated\\r\\nby his animals\\' love, by his affection for that other animal which I had\\r\\njust killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl fired, and it was as if somebody had cut the string which held the\\r\\nbird suspended. I saw something black descend, and I heard the noise of\\r\\na fall among the rushes. And Pierrot brought it to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put them--they were already cold--into the same bag, and I returned to\\r\\nParis the same evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HOLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCUTS AND WOUNDS WHICH CAUSED DEATH. That was the heading of the charge\\r\\nwhich brought Leopold Renard, upholsterer, before the Assize Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flamèche, widow of the\\r\\nvictim, and Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent, plumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, a little ugly woman,\\r\\nwho looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how Renard (Leopold) recounted the drama:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens, it is a misfortune of which I was the first victim all\\r\\nthe time, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts are their\\r\\nown commentary, Monsieur le Président. I am an honest man, a hard\\r\\nworking man, an upholsterer in the same street for the last sixteen\\r\\nyears, known, liked, respected and esteemed by all, as my neighbors have\\r\\ntestified, even the porter who is not _folâtre_ every day. I am fond of\\r\\nwork, I am fond of saving, I like honest men, and respectable pleasures.\\r\\nThat is what has ruined me, so much the worse for me; but as my will had\\r\\nnothing to do with it, I continue to respect myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every Sunday for the last five years, my wife and I have been to spend\\r\\nthe day at Passy. We get fresh air, without counting that we are fond of\\r\\nfishing. Oh! we are as fond of it as we are of small onions. Mélie\\r\\ninspired me with that passion, the jade, and she is more enthusiastic\\r\\nthan I am, the scold, seeing that all the mischief in this business is\\r\\nher fault, as you will see immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am strong and mild-tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in me.\\r\\nBut she! oh! la! la! she looks like nothing, she is short and thin; very\\r\\nwell, she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny that she has\\r\\nsome good qualities; she has some, and very important ones for a man in\\r\\nbusiness. But her character! Just ask about it in the neighborhood, and\\r\\neven the porter\\'s wife, who has just sent me about my business ... she\\r\\nwill tell you something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day she used to find fault with my mild temper: \\'I would not put\\r\\nup with this! I would not put up with that.\\' If I had listened to her,\\r\\nMonsieur le Président, I should have had at least three bouts of\\r\\nfisticuffs a month....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Renard interrupted him: \"And for good reasons too; they laugh\\r\\nbest who laugh last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned towards her frankly: \"Oh! very well, I can charge you, since\\r\\nyou were the cause of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, facing the President again he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening, so as\\r\\nto be able to begin fishing at daybreak the next morning. It is a habit\\r\\nwhich has become a second nature with us, as the saying is. Three years\\r\\nago this summer I discovered a place, oh! such a spot! Oh! there! in the\\r\\nshade, eight feet of water at least and perhaps ten, a hole with\\r\\n_retour_ under the bank, a regular nest for fish and a paradise for the\\r\\nfisherman. I might look upon that hole as my property, Monsieur le\\r\\nPrésident, as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the\\r\\nneighborhood knew it, without making any opposition. They used to say:\\r\\n\\'That is Renard\\'s place;\\' and nobody would have gone to it, not even\\r\\nMonsieur Plumsay, who is well known, be it said without any offense, for\\r\\nboning other peoples\\' places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I returned to my place of which I felt certain, just as if I had\\r\\nowned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when I got into\\r\\n_Delila_, with my wife. _Delila_ is my Norwegian boat, which I had built\\r\\nby Fourmaise, and which is light and safe. Well, as I said, we got into\\r\\nthe boat and we were going to bait, and for baiting, there is nobody to\\r\\nbe compared with me, and they all know it. You want to know with what I\\r\\nbait? I cannot answer that question; it has nothing to do with the\\r\\naccident; I cannot answer, that is my secret. There are more than three\\r\\nhundred people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy\\r\\nand liquors, fried fish, matelotes,[16] to make me tell! But just go and\\r\\ntry whether the chub will come. Ah! they have patted my stomach to get\\r\\nat my secret, my recipe.... Only my wife knows ... and she will not tell\\r\\nit, any more than I shall!... Is not that so Mélie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the Court interrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just get to the facts as soon as you can,\" and the accused continued:\\r\\n\"I am getting to them; I am getting to them. Well, on Saturday July 8,\\r\\nwe left by the twenty-five past five train, and before dinner we went to\\r\\nground-bait as usual. The weather promised to keep fine, and I said to\\r\\nMélie: \\'All right for to-morrow!\\' And she replied: \\'It looks like it.\\'\\r\\nWe never talk more than that together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and that was\\r\\nthe cause of everything. I said to Mélie: \\'Look here Mélie, it is fine\\r\\nweather, so suppose I drink a bottle of _Casque à mèche_.\\' That is a\\r\\nlittle white wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too\\r\\nmuch of it it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a\\r\\nnightcap. Do you understand me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She replied: \\'You can do as you please, but you will be ill again, and\\r\\nI will not be able to get up to-morrow.\\' That was true, sensible and\\r\\nprudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless, I could not\\r\\nwithstand it, and I drank my bottle. It all comes from that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! It kept me awake till two o\\'clock in\\r\\nthe morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have\\r\\nheard the angel shouting at the last Judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In short, my wife woke me at six o\\'clock, and I jumped out of bed,\\r\\nhastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on\\r\\nboard _Delila_. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it\\r\\nwas already taken! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years,\\r\\nand it made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said\\r\\nto myself, \\'Confound it all! confound it!\\' And then my wife began to nag\\r\\nat me. \\'Eh! What about your _Casque à mèche_! Get along, you drunkard!\\r\\nAre you satisfied, you great fool?\\' I could say nothing, because it was\\r\\nall quite true, and so I landed all the same near the spot and tried to\\r\\nprofit by what was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch\\r\\nnothing, and go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a little thin man, in white linen coat and waistcoat, and with a\\r\\nlarge straw hat, and his wife, a fat woman who was doing embroidery, was\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When she saw us take up our position close to their place, she\\r\\nmurmured: \\'I suppose there are no other places on the river!\\' And my\\r\\nwife, who was furious, replied: \\'People who know how to behave, make\\r\\ninquiries about the habits of the neighborhood before occupying reserved\\r\\nspots.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did not want a fuss, I said to her: \\'Hold your tongue, Mélie. Let\\r\\nthem go on, let them go on; we shall see.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we had fastened _Delila_ under the willow trees, and had landed\\r\\nand were fishing side by side, Mélie and I, close to the two others; but\\r\\nhere, Monsieur, I must enter into details.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had only been there about five minutes when our male neighbor\\'s\\r\\nfloat began to go down two or three times, and then he pulled out a chub\\r\\nas thick as my thigh, rather less, perhaps, but nearly as big! My heart\\r\\nbeat, and the perspiration stood on my forehead, and Mélie said to me:\\r\\n\\'Well, you sot, did you see that?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then, Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who is fond of gudgeon\\r\\nfishing, passed in a boat, and called out to me; \\'So somebody has taken\\r\\nyour usual place, Monsieur Renard?\\' And I replied: \\'Yes, Monsieur Bru,\\r\\nthere are some people in this world who do not know the usages of common\\r\\npoliteness.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little man in linen pretended not to hear, nor his fat lump of a\\r\\nwife, either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the President interrupted him a second time: \"Take care, you are\\r\\ninsulting the widow, Madame Flamèche, who is present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard made his excuses: \"I beg your pardon, I beg pardon, my anger\\r\\ncarried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had passed when the\\r\\nlittle man caught another chub and another almost immediately, and\\r\\nanother five minutes later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The tears were in my eyes, and then I knew that Madame Renard was\\r\\nboiling with rage, for she kept on nagging at me: \\'Oh! how horrid! Don\\'t\\r\\nyou see that he is robbing you of your fish? Do you think that you will\\r\\ncatch anything? Not even a frog, nothing whatever. Why my hands are\\r\\nburning, just to think of it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I said to myself: \\'Let us wait until twelve o\\'clock. Then this\\r\\npoaching fellow will go to lunch, and I shall get my place again.\\' As\\r\\nfor me, Monsieur le Président, I lunch on the spot every Sunday; we\\r\\nbring our provisions in _Delila_. But there! At twelve o\\'clock, the\\r\\nwretch produced a fowl out of a newspaper, and while he was eating,\\r\\nactually he caught another chub!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélie and I had a morsel also, just a thumb-piece, a mere nothing, for\\r\\nour heart was not in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I took up my newspaper, to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I read\\r\\nthe _Gil Blas_ in the shade like that, by the side of the water. It is\\r\\nColumbine\\'s day, you know, Columbine who writes the articles in the _Gil\\r\\nBlas_. I generally put Madame Renard into a passion by pretending to\\r\\nknow this Columbine. It is not true, for I do not know her, and have\\r\\nnever seen her, but that does not matter; she writes very well, and\\r\\nthen she says things straight out for a woman. She suits me, and there\\r\\nare not many of her sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately, and very\\r\\nangry, and so I held my tongue, and at that moment our two witnesses who\\r\\nare present here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur Durdent appeared on the\\r\\nother side of the river. We knew each other by sight. The little man\\r\\nbegan to fish again, and he caught so many that I trembled with\\r\\nvexation, and his wife said: \\'It is an uncommonly good spot, and we will\\r\\ncome here always Desiré.\\' As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and\\r\\nMadame Renard kept repeating: \\'You are not a man; you have the blood of\\r\\na chicken in your veins;\\' and suddenly I said to her: \\'Look here, I\\r\\nwould rather go away, or I shall only be doing something foolish.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she whispered to me as if she had put a red-hot iron under my nose:\\r\\n\\'You are not a man. Now you are going to run away, and surrender your\\r\\nplace! Off you go, Bazaine!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I felt that, but yet I did not move, while the other fellow\\r\\npulled out a bream, oh! I never saw such a large one before, never! And\\r\\nthen my wife began to talk aloud, as if she were thinking, and you can\\r\\nsee her trickery. She said: \\'That is what one might call stolen fish,\\r\\nseeing that we baited the place ourselves. At any rate, they ought to\\r\\ngive us back the money we have spent on bait.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the fat woman in the cotton dress said in turn: \\'Do you mean to\\r\\ncall us thieves, Madame?\\' And they began to explain, and then they came\\r\\nto words. Oh! Lord! those creatures know some good ones. They shouted\\r\\nso loud, that our two witnesses, who were on the other bank, began to\\r\\ncall out by way of a joke: \\'Less noise over there; you will prevent your\\r\\nhusbands from fishing.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is that neither of us moved any more than if we had been two\\r\\ntree-stumps. We remained there, with our noses over the water, as if we\\r\\nhad heard nothing, but by Jove, we heard all the same. \\'You are a mere\\r\\nliar.--You are nothing better than a streetwalker.--You are only a\\r\\ntrollop.--You are a regular strumpet.\\' And so on, and so on; a sailor\\r\\ncould not have said more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, and turned round. It was the other\\r\\none, the fat woman, who had fallen onto my wife with her parasol.\\r\\n_Whack! whack_! Mélie got two of them, but she was furious, and she hits\\r\\nhard when she is in a rage, so she caught the fat woman by the hair and\\r\\nthen, _thump, thump_, and slaps in the face rained down like ripe plums.\\r\\nI should have let them go on; women among themselves; men among\\r\\nthemselves; it does not do to mix the blows, but the little man in the\\r\\nlinen jacket jumped up like a devil and was going to rush at my wife.\\r\\nAh! no, no, not that my friend! I caught the gentleman with the end of\\r\\nmy fist, and _crash, crash_, one on the nose, the other in the stomach.\\r\\nHe threw up his arms and legs and fell on his back into the river, just\\r\\ninto the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le Président, if\\r\\nI had had the time. But unfortunately the fat woman got the better of\\r\\nit, and she was drubbing Mélie terribly. I know that I ought not to have\\r\\nassisted her while the man was drinking his fill, but I never thought\\r\\nthat he would drown, and said to myself: \\'Bah, it will cool him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I therefore ran up to the women to separate them, and all I received\\r\\nwas scratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures! Well, it took me\\r\\nfive minutes, and perhaps ten to separate those two viragoes, and when I\\r\\nturned round, there was nothing more to be seen, and the water was as\\r\\nsmooth as a lake, while the others yonder kept shouting: \\'Fish him out!\\'\\r\\nand though it was all very well to say that, I cannot swim and still\\r\\nless dive!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At last the man from the dam came, and two gentlemen with boat hooks,\\r\\nbut it had taken over a quarter of an hour. He was found at the bottom\\r\\nof the hole in eight feet of water, as I have said, but he had got it,\\r\\nthe poor little man in his linen suit! There are the facts, such as I\\r\\nhave sworn to. I am innocent, on my honor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe witnesses having deposed to the same effect, the accused was\\r\\nacquitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSAVED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marquise de Rennedon came rushing in like a ball smashing a\\r\\nwindow, and she began to laugh before she spoke, to laugh until she\\r\\ncried, like she had done a month previously, when she had told her\\r\\nfriend that she had betrayed the marquis in order to have her revenge,\\r\\nand only once, because he was really too stupid and too jealous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness de Grangerie had thrown the book which she was\\r\\nreading on the sofa, and looked at Annette curiously. She was already\\r\\nlaughing herself, and at last she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you been doing now?\" \"Oh! ... my dear!... my dear! it is too\\r\\nfunny ... too funny.... Just fancy ... I am saved!... saved!...\\r\\nsaved!\"... \"How do you mean, saved!\" \"Yes, saved!\" \"From what?\" \"From my\\r\\nhusband, my dear, saved! Delivered! free! free! free!\" \"How free? in\\r\\nwhat?\" \"In what? Divorce! Yes, a divorce! I have my divorce!\" \"You are\\r\\ndivorced?\" \"No, not yet; how stupid you are! One does not get divorced\\r\\nin three hours! But I have my proofs that he has deceived me ... caught\\r\\nin the very act ... just think!... in the very act.... I have got him\\r\\ntight....\" \"Oh! do tell me all about it! So he deceived you?\" \"Yes, that\\r\\nis to say no ... yes and no ... I do not know. At any rate, I have\\r\\nproofs, and that is the chief thing.\" \"How did you manage it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did I manage it?... This is how! I have been energetic, very\\r\\nenergetic. For the last three months he has been odious, altogether\\r\\nodious, brutal, coarse, a despot, in one word, vile. So I said to\\r\\nmyself: This cannot last, I must have a divorce! But how? for it is not\\r\\nvery easy? I tried to make him beat me, but he would not. He put me out\\r\\nfrom morning till night, made me go out when I did not wish to, and to\\r\\nremain at home when I wanted to dine out; he made my life unbearable for\\r\\nme from one week\\'s end to the other, but he never struck me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I tried to find out whether he had a mistress. Yes, he had one,\\r\\nbut he took a thousand precautions in going to see her, and they could\\r\\nnever be caught together. Guess what I did then?\" \"I cannot guess.\" \"Oh!\\r\\nyou could never guess. I asked my brother to procure me a photograph of\\r\\nthe creature.\" \"Of your husband\\'s mistress?\" \"Yes. It cost Jacques\\r\\nfifteen louis, the price of an evening, from seven o\\'clock until\\r\\nmidnight, including a dinner, at three louis an hour, and he obtained\\r\\nthe photograph into the bargain.\" \"It appears to me that he might have\\r\\nobtained it anyhow by means of some artifice and without ... without ...\\r\\nwithout being obliged to take the original at the same time.\" \"Oh! she\\r\\nis pretty, and Jacques did not mind the least. And then, I wanted some\\r\\ndetails about her, physical details about her figure, her breast, her\\r\\ncomplexion, a thousand things, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not understand you.\" \"You shall see. When I had learned all that I\\r\\nwanted to know, I went to a ... how shall I put it ... to a man of\\r\\nbusiness ... you know ... one of those men who transact business of all\\r\\nsorts ... agents of ... of ... of publicity and complicity ... one of\\r\\nthose men ... well, you understand what I mean.\" \"Pretty nearly, I\\r\\nthink. And what did you say to him?\" \"I said to him, showing the\\r\\nphotograph of Clarisse (her name is Clarisse): \\'Monsieur, I want a\\r\\nlady\\'s maid who resembles this photograph. I require one who is pretty,\\r\\nelegant, neat and sharp. I will pay her whatever is necessary, and if it\\r\\ncosts me ten thousand francs so much the worse. I shall not require her\\r\\nfor more than three months.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man looked extremely astonished, and said: \\'Do you require a maid\\r\\nof an irreproachable character, Madame?\\' I blushed, and stammered. \\'Yes,\\r\\nof course, for honesty.\\' He continued: ... \\'And ... then ... as regards\\r\\nmorals....\\' I did not venture to reply, so I only made a sign with my\\r\\nhead, which signified: _no_. Then suddenly, I comprehended that he had a\\r\\nhorrible suspicion and losing my presence of mind, I exclaimed: \\'Oh,\\r\\nMonsieur, ... it is for my husband, in order that I may surprise\\r\\nhim....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the man began to laugh, and from his looks I gathered that I had\\r\\nregained his esteem. He even thought I was brave, and I would willingly\\r\\nhave made a bet that at that moment he was longing to shake hands with\\r\\nme. However, he said to me: \\'In a week, Madame, I shall have what you\\r\\nrequire; I will answer for my success, and you shall not pay me until I\\r\\nhave succeeded. So this is a photograph of your husband\\'s mistress?\\'\\r\\n\\'Yes, Monsieur,\\' \\'A handsome woman, and not too stout. And what scent?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not understand, and repeated: \\'What scent?\\' He smiled: \\'Yes,\\r\\nMadame, the perfume is essential to seduce a man, for it unconsciously\\r\\nbrings to his mind certain reminiscences which dispose him to action;\\r\\nthe perfume creates an obscure confusion in his mind, and disturbs and\\r\\nenervates him by recalling his pleasures to him. You must also try to\\r\\nfind out what your husband is in the habit of eating when he dines with\\r\\nhis lady, and you might give him the same dishes the day you catch him.\\r\\nOh! we have got him, Madame, we have got him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went away delighted, for here I had lighted on a very intelligent\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three days later, I saw a tall, dark girl arrive at my house; she was\\r\\nvery handsome and her looks were modest and bold at the same time, the\\r\\npeculiar look of a female rake. She behaved very properly towards me,\\r\\nand as I did not exactly know what she was, I called her _Mademoiselle_,\\r\\nbut she said immediately: \\'Oh! pray, Madame, only call me Rose.\\' And she\\r\\nbegan to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, Rose, you know why you have come here?\\' \\'I can guess it,\\r\\nMadame.\\' \\'Very good, my girl ... and that will not ... be too much\\r\\nbother for you?\\' \\'Oh! madame, this will be the eighth divorce that I\\r\\nshall have caused; I am used to it.\\' \\'Why, that is capital. Will it take\\r\\nyou long to succeed?\\' \\'Oh! Madame, that depends entirely on Monsieur\\'s\\r\\ntemperament. When I have seen Monsieur for five minutes alone I shall\\r\\nbe able to tell you exactly.\\' \\'You will see him soon, my child, but I\\r\\nmust tell you that he is not handsome.\\' \\'That does not matter to me,\\r\\nMadame. I have already separated some very ugly ones. But I must ask\\r\\nyou, Madame, whether you have discovered his favorite perfume?\\' \\'Yes,\\r\\nRose,--verbena.\\' \\'So much the better, Madame, for I am also very fond of\\r\\nthat scent! Can you also tell me, Madame, whether Monsieur\\'s mistress\\r\\nwears silk underclothing and nightdresses?\\' \\'No, my child, cambric and\\r\\nlace.\\' \\'Oh! then she is altogether of superior station, for silk\\r\\nunderclothing is getting quite common.\\' \\'What you say is quite true!\\'\\r\\n\\'Well, Madame, I will enter your service.\\' And so, as a matter of fact,\\r\\nshe did immediately, and as if she had done nothing else all her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An hour later my husband came home. Rose did not even raise her eyes to\\r\\nhim, but he raised his eyes to her. She already smelt strongly of\\r\\nverbena, and in five minutes she left the room, and he immediately asked\\r\\nme: \\'Who is that girl?\\' \\'Why ... my new lady\\'s maid.\\' \\'Where did you\\r\\npick her up?\\' \\'Baroness de Grangerie got her for me with the best\\r\\nreferences.\\' \\'Ah! she is rather pretty!\\' \\'Do you think so?\\' \\'Why, yes\\r\\n... for a lady\\'s maid.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was delighted, for I felt that he was already biting, and that same\\r\\nevening Rose said to me: \\'I can now promise you that it will not take\\r\\nmore than a fortnight. Monsieur is very easily caught!\\' \\'Ah! you have\\r\\ntried already?\\' \\'No, Madame, he only asked what my name was ... so that\\r\\nhe might hear what my voice was like.\\' \\'Very well, my dear Rose. Get on\\r\\nas quick as you can.\\' \\'Do not be alarmed, Madame; I shall only resist\\r\\nlong enough not to make myself depreciated.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of a week my husband scarcely ever went out; I saw him\\r\\nroaming about the house the whole afternoon, and what was most\\r\\nsignificant in the matter was, that he no longer prevented me from going\\r\\nout. And I, I was out of doors nearly the whole day long, ... in order\\r\\n... in order to leave him at liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the ninth day, while Rose was undressing me, she said to me with a\\r\\ntimid air: \\'It happened this morning, Madame.\\' I was rather surprised,\\r\\nor rather overcome even, not at the part itself, but at the way in which\\r\\nshe told me, and I stammered out: \\'And ... and ... it went off well?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! yes, very well, Madame. For the last three days he has been\\r\\npressing me, but I did not wish matters to proceed too quickly. You will\\r\\ntell me when you want us to be caught, Madame.\\' \\'Yes, certainly.\\r\\nHere!... let us say Thursday.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, I shall grant nothing\\r\\nmore until then, so as to keep Monsieur on the alert.\\' \\'You are sure not\\r\\nto fail?\\' \\'Oh! quite sure, Madame. I will excite him, so as to make him\\r\\nbe there at the very moment which you may appoint.\\' \\'Let us say five\\r\\no\\'clock, then.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, and where?\\' \\'Well ... in my\\r\\nbedroom.\\' \\'Very good, Madame, in your bedroom.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will understand what I did then, my dear. I went and fetched Mamma\\r\\nand Papa first of all, and then my uncle d\\'Orvelin, the President, and\\r\\nMonsieur Raplet, the Judge, my husband\\'s friend. I had not told them\\r\\nwhat I was going to show them, but I made them all go on tiptoe as far\\r\\nas the door of my room. I waited until five o\\'clock exactly, and oh! how\\r\\nmy heart beat! I had made the porter come upstairs as well, so as to\\r\\nhave an additional witness! And then ... and then at the moment when the\\r\\nclock began to strike, I opened the door wide.... Ah! ah! ah! Here he\\r\\nwas evidently, ... it was quite evident, my dear.... Oh! what a face!...\\r\\nif you had only seen his face!... And he turned round, the idiot! Oh!\\r\\nhow funny he looked.... I laughed, I laughed.... And papa was angry and\\r\\nwanted to give my husband a beating.... And the porter, a good servant,\\r\\nhelped him to dress himself ... before us ... before us.... He buttoned\\r\\nhis braces for him ... what a joke it was!... As for Rose, she was\\r\\nperfect, absolutely perfect.... She cried ... oh! she cried very well.\\r\\nShe is an invaluable girl.... If you ever want her, don\\'t forget!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here I am.... I came immediately to tell you of the affair ...\\r\\ndirectly. I am free. Long live divorce!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she began to dance in the middle of the drawing-room, while the\\r\\nlittle baroness, who was thoughtful and vexed, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you not invite me to see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBELLFLOWER[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow strange those old recollections are which haunt us, without our\\r\\nbeing able to get rid of them!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so\\r\\nvividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many\\r\\nsinister things, which were either affecting or terrible, that I am\\r\\nastonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of\\r\\nMother Bellflower recurring to my mind\\'s eye, just as I knew her\\r\\nformerly, now so long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old seamstress, who came to my parents house once a week,\\r\\nevery Thursday to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those\\r\\ncountry houses called _châteaux_, and which are merely old houses with\\r\\npointed roofs, which are surrounded by three or four farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few\\r\\nhundred yards off, and lay closely round the church, a red brick church,\\r\\nwhich had become black with age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and\\r\\nseven in the morning, and went immediately into the linen-room and began\\r\\nto work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she\\r\\nhad a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard,\\r\\ngrowing in tufts, in curly bunches, which looked as if they had been\\r\\nsown by a madman over that great face of a gendarme in petticoats. She\\r\\nhad them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on\\r\\nher cheeks; and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long,\\r\\nand quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of\\r\\nmoustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe limped, but not like lame people generally do, but like a ship at\\r\\nanchor. When she planted her great, bony, swerving body on her sound\\r\\nleg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then\\r\\nsuddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss, and buried herself\\r\\nin the ground. Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she balanced herself\\r\\nat the same time, and her head, which was always covered with an\\r\\nenormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to\\r\\ntraverse the horizon from North to South and from South to North, at\\r\\neach of her movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I went into the\\r\\nlinen-room, where I found her installed at work, with a foot-warmer\\r\\nunder her feet. As soon as I arrived, she made me take the foot-warmer\\r\\nand sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large, chilly\\r\\nroom under the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told me stories, while mending the linen with her long crooked\\r\\nnimble fingers; her eyes behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had\\r\\nimpaired her sight, appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, as far as I can remember, the things which she told me and by\\r\\nwhich my childish heart was moved, the large heart of a poor woman. She\\r\\ntold me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the\\r\\ncowhouse and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet\\'s\\r\\nmill, looking at the sails turning, or about a hen\\'s egg, which had\\r\\nbeen found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand\\r\\nwhat creature had been there to lay it, or the story of Jean-Jean Pila\\'s\\r\\ndog, who had been ten leagues to bring back his master\\'s breeches, which\\r\\na tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors, after\\r\\nhe had been in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a\\r\\nmanner, that in my mind they assumed the proportions of\\r\\nnever-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the\\r\\ningenious stories invented by the poets which my mother told me in the\\r\\nevening had none of the flavor, none of the fullness nor of the vigor of\\r\\nthe peasant woman\\'s narratives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, one Thursday, when I had spent all the morning in listening to\\r\\nMother Clochette, I wanted to go up stairs to her again during the day\\r\\nafter picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm.\\r\\nI remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress lying on\\r\\nthe ground by the side of her chair, with her face to the ground and her\\r\\narms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of\\r\\nmy shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer\\r\\none, no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles\\r\\nglistened against the wall, as they had rolled away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few\\r\\nminutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred\\r\\nmy childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing-room and went\\r\\nand hid myself in a dark corner, in the depths of a great, old armchair,\\r\\nwhere I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time no doubt, for\\r\\nnight came on. Suddenly somebody came in with a lamp, without seeing me,\\r\\nhowever, and I heard my father and mother talking with the medical man,\\r\\nwhose voice I recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the causes of\\r\\nthe accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down\\r\\nand had a glass of liquor and biscuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my\\r\\nmind until I die! I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"the poor woman! She broke her leg the day of my arrival\\r\\nhere, and I had only not even had time to wash my hands after getting\\r\\noff the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad\\r\\ncase, very bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would any one\\r\\nbelieve it? I have never told her story before, and nobody except myself\\r\\nand one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the\\r\\ncountry, ever knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be less discreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then a young assistant teacher came to live in the village; he was\\r\\ngood-looking and had the bearing of a sub-officer. All the girls ran\\r\\nafter him, and he acted the disdainful, and besides that, he was very\\r\\nmuch afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who\\r\\noccasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here, and\\r\\nwho was afterwards nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled\\r\\nout the pretty young girl, who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by\\r\\nthis impregnable conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and\\r\\nhe succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the\\r\\nhay-loft behind the school, at night, after she had done her day\\'s\\r\\nsewing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left\\r\\nthe Grabu\\'s, she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to wait for her\\r\\nlover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to\\r\\nher, when the door of the hay-loft opened and the schoolmaster appeared,\\r\\nand asked: \\'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?\\' Feeling sure that\\r\\nhe would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and\\r\\nreplied stupidly: \\'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of\\r\\nhay, Monsieur Grabu.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark, and Sigisbert pushed the\\r\\nfrightened girl to the further end and said: \\'Go there and hide\\r\\nyourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: \\'Why, you are\\r\\nnot by yourself?\\' \\'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!\\' \\'But you are not, for you\\r\\nare talking.\\' \\'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.\\' \\'I will soon find out,\\'\\r\\nthe old man replied, and double-locking the door, he went down to get a\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one frequently meets, lost\\r\\nhis head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: \\'Hide\\r\\nyourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread\\r\\nfor my whole life; you will ruin my whole career.... Do hide yourself!\\'\\r\\nThey could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to\\r\\nthe window, which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly, and\\r\\nthen in a low and determined voice she said: \\'You will come and pick me\\r\\nup when he is gone,\\' and she jumped out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise, and a\\r\\nquarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his\\r\\nadventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get\\r\\nup, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to\\r\\nfetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate\\r\\ngirl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the\\r\\nbones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain, and merely\\r\\nsaid, with admirable resignation: \\'I am punished, well punished!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl\\'s friends and told them a\\r\\nmade-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed\\r\\nher, outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole\\r\\nmonth tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all! And I say that this woman was a heroine, and belonged to\\r\\nthe race of those who accomplished the grandest deeds in history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr,\\r\\na noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely\\r\\nadmire her, I should not have told you this story, which I would never\\r\\ntell anyone during her life: you understand why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor ceased; Mamma cried and Papa said some words which I did not\\r\\ncatch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the\\r\\narmchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps\\r\\nand something knocking against the side of the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were carrying away Clochette\\'s body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MARQUIS DE FUMEROL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger de Toumeville was sitting astride a chair in the midst of his\\r\\nfriends and talking; he held a cigar in his hand, and from time to time\\r\\ntook a whiff and blew out a small cloud of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were at dinner when a letter was brought in and my father opened it.\\r\\nYou know my father, who thinks that he is king of France _ad interim_. I\\r\\ncall him Don Quixote, because for twelve years he has been running a\\r\\ntilt against the windmill of the Republic, without quite knowing whether\\r\\nit was in the name of the Bourbons or of the Orleans. At present he is\\r\\nholding the lance in the name of the Orleans alone, because there is\\r\\nnobody else but them left. In any case, he thinks himself the first\\r\\ngentleman in France, the best known, the most influential, the head of\\r\\nthe party; and as he is an irremovable senator, he thinks that the\\r\\nneighboring kings\\' thrones are very insecure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for my mother, she is my father\\'s soul, she is the soul of the\\r\\nkingdom and of religion, the right arm of God, and the scourge of\\r\\nevil-thinkers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, so a letter was brought in while we were at dinner, and my father\\r\\nopened and read it, and then he said to my mother: \\'Your brother is\\r\\ndying.\\' She grew very pale. My uncle was scarcely ever mentioned in the\\r\\nhouse, and I did not know him at all; all I knew from public talk was,\\r\\nthat he had led, and was still leading, the life of a buffoon. After\\r\\nhaving spent his fortune with an incalculable number of women, he had\\r\\nonly retained two mistresses, with whom he was living in small\\r\\napartments in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An ex-peer of France and ex-colonel of cavalry, it was said that he\\r\\nbelieved in neither God nor devil. Not believing, therefore, in a future\\r\\nlife he had abused this present life in every way, and he had become the\\r\\nliving wound of my mother\\'s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Give me that letter, Paul,\\' she said, and when she had read it, I\\r\\nasked for it in my turn. Here it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Monsieur le comte, I thinks I ought to lett you knaw that your\\r\\n     brother-law, count Fumeroll is going to dye. Perhapps you would\\r\\n     make preparations and not forgett that I told you._\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             _Your servant_,\\r\\n                                             MÉLANI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'We must think,\\' papa murmured. \\'In my position, I ought to watch over\\r\\nyour brother\\'s last moments.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma continued: \\'I will send for Abbé Poivron and ask his advice, and\\r\\nthen I will go to my brother\\'s with the abbé and Roger. Stop here Paul,\\r\\nfor you must not compromise yourself, but a woman can, and ought to do\\r\\nthese things. But for a politician in your position, it is another\\r\\nmatter. It would be a fine thing for one of your opponents to be able to\\r\\nbring one of your most laudable actions up against you.\\' \\'You are\\r\\nright,\\' my father said. \\'Do as you think best, my dear wife.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quarter of an hour later, the Abbé Poivron came into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and the situation was explained to him, analyzed and\\r\\ndiscussed in all its bearings. If the Marquis de Fumerol, one of the\\r\\ngreatest names in France, were to die without the succor of religion,\\r\\nit would assuredly be a terrible blow for the nobility in general, and\\r\\nfor the Count de Toumeville in particular, and the freethinkers would be\\r\\ntriumphant. The evilly disposed newspapers would sing songs of victory\\r\\nfor six months; my mother\\'s name would be dragged through the mire and\\r\\nbrought into the prose of Socialistic journals, and my father\\'s would be\\r\\nbespattered. It was impossible that such a thing should occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A crusade was therefore immediately decided upon, which was to be led\\r\\nby the Abbé Poivron, a little fat, clean, slightly scented priest, a\\r\\ntrue vicar of a large church in a noble and rich quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The landau was ordered and we started all three, my mother, the Curé\\r\\nand I, to administer the last sacraments to my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It had been decided first of all we should see Madame Mélani who had\\r\\nwritten the letter, and who was most likely the porter\\'s wife, or my\\r\\nuncle\\'s servant, and I got down as a scout in front of a seven-storied\\r\\nhouse and went into a dark passage, where I had great difficulty in\\r\\nfinding the porter\\'s den. He looked at me distrustfully, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame Mélani, if you please.\\' \\'Don\\'t know her!\\' \\'But I have received\\r\\na letter from her.\\' \\'That may be, but don\\'t know her. Are you asking for\\r\\nsome kept woman?\\' \\'No, a servant probably. She wrote me about a place.\\'\\r\\n\\'A servant?... a servant?... Perhaps it is the Marquis\\'s. Go and see,\\r\\nthe fifth story on the left.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as he found I was not asking for a kept woman, he became more\\r\\nfriendly and came as far as the passage with me. He was a tall, thin\\r\\nman with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic movements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I climbed up a long spiral staircase, whose balusters I did not venture\\r\\nto touch, and I gave three discreet knocks at the left-hand door on the\\r\\nfifth story. It opened immediately, and an enormous dirty woman appeared\\r\\nbefore me, who barred the entrance with her open arms which she leant\\r\\nagainst the two doorposts, and grumbled:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you want?\\' \\'Are you Madame Mélani?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'I am the Viscounte\\r\\nde Toumeville.\\' \\'Ah! All right! Come in.\\' \\'Well, the fact is my mother\\r\\nis downstairs with a priest.\\' \\'Oh! All right; go and bring them up; but\\r\\ntake care of the porter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went downstairs and came up again with my mother, who was followed by\\r\\nthe abbé, and I fancied that I heard other footsteps behind us. As soon\\r\\nas we were in the kitchen, Mélani offered us chairs, and we all four sat\\r\\ndown to deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is he very ill?\\' my mother asked. \\'Oh! yes, Madame; he will not be\\r\\nhere long.\\' \\'Does he seem disposed to receive a visit from a priest?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! I do not think so.\\' \\'Can I see him?\\' \\'Well ... yes ... Madame ...\\r\\nonly ... only ... those young ladies are with him.\\' \\'What young ladies?\\'\\r\\n\\'Why ... why ... his lady friends, of course.\\' \\'Oh!\\' Mamma had grown\\r\\nscarlet, and the Abbé Poivron had lowered his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The affair began to amuse me, and I said: \\'Suppose I go in first? I\\r\\nshall see how he receives me, and perhaps I shall be able to prepare his\\r\\nheart for you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother who did not suspect any trick, replied: \\'Yes, go my dear.\\'\\r\\nBut a woman\\'s voice cried out: \\'Mélani!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fat servant ran out and said: \\'What do you want, Mademoiselle\\r\\nClaire?\\' \\'The omelette, quickly.\\' \\'In a minute, Mademoiselle.\\' And\\r\\ncoming back to us, she explained this summons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'They ordered a cheese omelette at two o\\'clock as a slight collation.\\'\\r\\nAnd immediately she began to break the eggs into a salad bowl, and began\\r\\nto whip them vigorously, while I went out onto the landing and pulled\\r\\nthe bell, so as to announce my official arrival. Mélani opened the door\\r\\nto me, and made me sit down in an ante-room, while she went to tell my\\r\\nuncle, that I had come; then she came back and asked me to go in, while\\r\\nthe Abbé hid behind the door, so that he might appear at the first sign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very much surprised at seeing my uncle, for he was very\\r\\nhandsome, very solemn and very elegant, was the old rake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sitting, almost lying in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in\\r\\nblankets, with his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the\\r\\nchair, he was waiting death with Biblical dignity. His white beard fell\\r\\nonto his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled with it on\\r\\nhis cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Standing behind his armchair, as if to defend him against me, were two\\r\\nyoung women, two stout young women, who looked at me with the bold eyes\\r\\nof prostitutes. In their petticoats and morning wrappers, with bare\\r\\narms, with coal black hair twisted up onto the nape of their neck, with\\r\\nembroidered Oriental slippers which showed their ankles and silk\\r\\nstockings, they looked like the immoral figures of some symbolical\\r\\npainting, by the side of the dying man. Between the easy-chair and the\\r\\nbed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on which two plates,\\r\\ntwo glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting for the cheese\\r\\nomelette which had been ordered some time before of Mélani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle said in weak, almost breathless but clear voice: \\'Good\\r\\nmorning, my child: it is rather late in the day to come and see me; our\\r\\nacquaintance will not last long.\\' I stammered out: \\'It was not my fault,\\r\\nuncle,\\' ... and he replied: \\'No; I know that. It is your father and\\r\\nmother\\'s fault more than yours.... How are they?\\' \\'Pretty well, thank\\r\\nyou. When they heard that you were ill, they sent me to ask after you.\\'\\r\\n\\'Ah! Why did they not come themselves?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I looked up at the two girls and said gently: \\'It is not their fault if\\r\\nthey could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my father, and\\r\\nimpossible for my mother to come in here....\\' The old man did not reply,\\r\\nbut raised his hand towards mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and\\r\\nkept it in my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The door opened, Mélani came in with the omelette and put it on the\\r\\ntable, and the two girls immediately sat down in front of their plates\\r\\nand began to eat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: \\'Uncle,\\r\\nit would be a great pleasure for my mother to embrace you.\\' \\'I also ...\\'\\r\\nhe murmured, \\'should like....\\' He said no more, and I could think of\\r\\nnothing to propose to him, and nothing more was heard except the noise\\r\\nof the plates and that vague movement of eating mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now the Abbé, who was listening behind the door, seeing our\\r\\nembarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had\\r\\ncome to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at that\\r\\napparition, that at first he remained motionless; but then he opened his\\r\\nmouth as if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in a\\r\\nstrong, deep, furious voice: \\'What are you doing here?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé, who was used to difficult situations came further in the\\r\\nroom, murmuring: \\'I have come in your sister\\'s name, Monsieur le\\r\\nMarquis; she has sent me.... She would be so happy, Monsieur....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the Marquis was not listening. Raising one hand, he pointed to the\\r\\ndoor with a proud and tragic gesture, and he said angrily and gasping\\r\\nfor breath: \\'Leave this room ... go out ... robber of souls.... Go out\\r\\nfrom here, you violator of consciences.... Go out from here, you\\r\\npicklock of dying men\\'s doors!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé went backwards, and I also went to the door, beating a retreat\\r\\nwith the clergyman; and the two little women who were avenged got up,\\r\\nleaving their omelette only half eaten, and went and stood on either\\r\\nside of my uncle\\'s armchair, putting their hands on his arms to calm\\r\\nhim, and to protect him against the criminal enterprises of the Family\\r\\nand of Religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé and I rejoined my mother in the kitchen, and Mélani again\\r\\noffered us chairs, \\'I knew quite well that it would not go of its own\\r\\naccord; we must try some other means, otherwise he will escape us.\\' And\\r\\nthey began deliberating afresh, my mother being of one opinion and the\\r\\nAbbé of another, while I held a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had been discussing the matter in a low voice for half an hour,\\r\\nperhaps, when a great noise of furniture being moved and of cries\\r\\nuttered by my uncle, more vehement and terrible even, than the former\\r\\nhad been, made us all four jump up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Through the doors and walls we could hear him shouting: \\'Go out ... out\\r\\n... rascals, ... humbugs, get out scoundrels ... get out ... get\\r\\nout!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélani rushed in, but came back immediately to call me to help her, and\\r\\nI hastened in. Opposite to my uncle who was terribly excited by anger,\\r\\nalmost standing up and vociferating, two men, one behind the other,\\r\\nseemed to be waiting till he should be dead with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By his long, ridiculous coat, his long English shoes, by his manners of\\r\\na tutor out of a situation, by his high collar, white necktie and\\r\\nstraight hair, by his humble face of a priest, I immediately recognized\\r\\nthe first as a Protestant minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The second was the porter of the house, who belonged to the reformed\\r\\nreligion and had followed us, and having seen our defeat had gone to\\r\\nfetch his own priest, in hopes of a better fate. My uncle seemed mad\\r\\nwith rage! If the sight of the Catholic priest, of the priest of his\\r\\nancestors, had irritated the Marquis de Fumerol, who had become a\\r\\nfreethinker, the sight of his porter\\'s minister made him altogether\\r\\nbeside himself. I therefore took the two men by the arm and threw them\\r\\nout of the room so violently that they embraced each other twice,\\r\\nbetween the two doors which led to the staircase, and then I disappeared\\r\\nin my turn and returned to the kitchen, which was our headquarters, in\\r\\norder to take counsel with my mother and the Abbé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mélani came back in terror, sobbing out: \\'He is dying ... he is\\r\\ndying ... come immediately ... he is dying....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother rushed out. My uncle had fallen onto the ground, full length\\r\\nalong the floor, and did not move. I fancy he was already dead. My\\r\\nmother was superb at that moment! She went straight up to the two girls\\r\\nwho were kneeling by the body and trying to raise it up, and pointing to\\r\\nthe door with irresistible authority, dignity and majesty, she said:\\r\\n\\'Now it is for you to go out.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they went out without a protest, and without saying a word. I must\\r\\nadd, that I was getting ready to turn them out as unceremoniously as I\\r\\nhad done the parson and the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the Abbé Poivron administered the last sacrament to my uncle with\\r\\nall the customary prayers and remitted all his sins, while my mother\\r\\nsobbed, kneeling near her brother. Suddenly, however, she exclaimed: \\'He\\r\\nrecognized me; he pressed my hand; I am sure he recognized me!!!... and\\r\\nthat he thanked me! Oh, God, what happiness!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Mamma! If she had known or guessed to whom those thanks ought to\\r\\nhave been addressed!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They laid my uncle on his bed; he was certainly dead that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame,\\' Mélani said, \\'we have no sheets to bury him in; all the linen\\r\\nbelongs to those two young ladies,\\' and when I looked at the omelette\\r\\nwhich they had not finished, I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the\\r\\nsame time. There are some strange moments and some strange sensations in\\r\\nlife, occasionally!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We gave my uncle a magnificent funeral, with five speeches at the\\r\\ngrave. Baron de Croiselles, the Senator, showed in admirable terms, that\\r\\nGod always returns victorious into well-born souls which have gone\\r\\nastray for a moment. All the members of the Royalist and Catholic party\\r\\nfollowed the funeral procession with the enthusiasm of triumphers,\\r\\nspeaking of that beautiful death, after a somewhat restless life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nViscount Roger ceased speaking, and those around him laughed. Then\\r\\nsomebody said: \"Bah! That is the story of conversions _in Extremis_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SIGNAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon was still asleep in her closed and\\r\\nperfumed bedroom, in her soft, low bed, between her sheets of delicate\\r\\ncambric, fine as lace and caressing as a kiss; she was sleeping alone\\r\\nand tranquil, the happy and profound sleep of divorced women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was awakened by loud voices in the little blue drawing-room, and she\\r\\nrecognized her dear friend, the little Baroness de Grangerie, who was\\r\\ndisputing with the lady\\'s maid, because the latter would not allow her\\r\\nto go into her mistress\\' room. So the little Marchioness got up, opened\\r\\nthe door, drew back the door-hangings and showed her head, nothing but\\r\\nher fair head, hidden under a cloud of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, that you have come so early?\" she asked.\\r\\n\"It is not nine o\\'clock yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little baroness who was very pale, nervous and feverish, replied: \"I\\r\\nmust speak to you. Something horrible has happened to me.\" \"Come in, my\\r\\ndear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went in, they kissed each other, and the little Marchioness got back\\r\\ninto her bed while the lady\\'s maid opened the windows to let in light\\r\\nand air, and then when she had left the room, Madame de Rennedon went\\r\\non: \"Well, tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame de Grangerie began to cry, shedding those pretty, bright tears\\r\\nwhich make woman more charming, and she stammered without wiping her\\r\\neyes, so as not to make them red: \"Oh! my dear, what has happened to me\\r\\nis abominable, abominable. I have not slept all night, not a minute; do\\r\\nyou hear, not a minute. Here, just feel my heart, how it is beating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, taking her friend\\'s hand, she put it on her breast, on that firm,\\r\\nround covering of women\\'s hearts which often suffices men, and prevents\\r\\nthem from seeking beneath. But her breast was really beating violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"It happened to me yesterday during the day, at about\\r\\nfour o\\'clock ... or half-past four; I cannot say exactly. You know my\\r\\napartments, and you know that my little drawing-room, where I always\\r\\nsit, looks onto the Rue Saint-Lazare, and that I have a mania for\\r\\nsitting at the window to look at the people passing. The neighborhood of\\r\\nthe railway station is very gay; so full of motion and lively.... Well,\\r\\nthat is just what I like! So, yesterday, I was sitting in the low chair\\r\\nwhich I have placed in my window recess; the window was open and I was\\r\\nnot thinking of anything; I was breathing the fresh air. You remember\\r\\nhow fine it was yesterday!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly, I remarked that there was also a woman sitting at the window,\\r\\na woman in red; I was in mauve, you know, my pretty mauve costume. I did\\r\\nnot know the woman, a new lodger, who had been there a month, and as it\\r\\nhad been raining for a month, I had not yet seen her, but I saw\\r\\nimmediately that she was a bad girl. At first I was very much shocked\\r\\nand disgusted that she should be at the window like I was; and then, by\\r\\ndegrees, it amused me to examine her. She was resting her elbows on the\\r\\nwindow ledge, and looking at the men, and the men looked at her also,\\r\\nall or nearly all. One might have said that they were apprised\\r\\nbeforehand by some means as they got near the house, which they scented\\r\\nas dogs scent game, for they suddenly raised their heads, and exchanged\\r\\na swift look with her, a freemason\\'s look. Hers said: \\'Will you?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theirs replied: \\'I have no time,\\' or else: \\'another day;\\' or else: \\'I\\r\\nhave not got a half penny;\\' or else: \\'Will you hide yourself, you\\r\\nwretch!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine how funny it was to see her carrying on such a piece\\r\\nof work, though, after all, it is her regular business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes she shut the window suddenly, and I saw a gentleman go in.\\r\\nShe had caught him like a fisherman hooks a gudgeon. Then I looked at my\\r\\nwatch, and I found that they stopped from twelve to twenty minutes,\\r\\nnever longer. In the end she really infatuated me, the spider! And then\\r\\nthe creature is so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked myself: How does she manage to make herself understood so\\r\\nquickly, so well and so completely? Does she add a sign of the head or a\\r\\nmotion of the hands to her looks? And I took my opera-glasses to watch\\r\\nher proceedings. Oh! they were very simple: first of all a glance, then\\r\\na smile, then a slight sign with the head, which meant: \\'Are you coming\\r\\nup?\\' But it was so slight, so vague, so discreet, that it required a\\r\\ngreat deal of knack to succeed as she did. And I asked myself: \\'I wonder\\r\\nif I could do that little movement, from below upwards, which was at the\\r\\nsame time bold and pretty, as well as she does,\\' for her gesture was\\r\\nvery pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went and tried it before the looking-glass, and, my dear, I did it\\r\\nbetter than she, a great deal better! I was enchanted, and resumed my\\r\\nplace at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She caught nobody more then, poor girl, nobody. She certainly had no\\r\\nluck. It must really be very terrible to earn one\\'s bread in that way,\\r\\nterrible and amusing occasionally, for really some of these men one\\r\\nmeets in the street are rather nice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After that they all came on my side of the road and none on hers; the\\r\\nsun had turned. They came one after the other, young, old, dark, fair,\\r\\ngray, white. I saw some who looked very nice, really very nice, my dear,\\r\\nfar better than my husband or than yours, I mean than your late husband,\\r\\nas you have got a divorce. Now you can choose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said to myself! If I give them the sign, will they understand me, who\\r\\nam a respectable woman? And I was seized with a mad longing to make that\\r\\nsign to them. I had a longing, the longing of a pregnant woman ... a\\r\\nterrible longing; you know, one of those longings which one cannot\\r\\nresist! I have some like that occasionally. How stupid such things are,\\r\\ndon\\'t you think so? I believe that we woman have the souls of monkeys. I\\r\\nhave been told (and it was a physician who told me) that the brain of a\\r\\nmonkey was very like ours. Of course we must imitate some one or other.\\r\\nWe imitate our husbands, when we love them, during the first months\\r\\nafter our marriage, and then our lovers, our female friends, our\\r\\nconfessors, when they are nice. We assume their ways of thought, their\\r\\nmanners of speech, their words, their gestures, everything. It is very\\r\\nstupid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, as for me, when I am too much tempted to do a thing I always\\r\\ndo it, and so I said to myself: \\'I will try it once, on one man only,\\r\\njust to see. What can happen to me? Nothing whatever! We shall exchange\\r\\na smile and that will be all, and I shall deny it, most certainly.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I began to make my choice. I wanted someone nice, very nice, and\\r\\nsuddenly I saw a tall, fair, very good-looking fellow coming along. I\\r\\nlike fair men, as you know. I looked at him, he looked at me; I smiled,\\r\\nhe smiled; I made the movement; oh! but scarcely; he replied _yes_ with\\r\\nhis head, and there he was, my dear! He came in at the large door of the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine what passed through my mind then! I thought I should\\r\\ngo mad. Oh! how frightened I was. Just think, he will speak to the\\r\\nservants! To Joseph, who is devoted to my husband! Joseph would\\r\\ncertainly think that I had known that gentleman for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could I do, just tell me? And he would ring in a moment. What\\r\\ncould I do, tell me? I thought I would go and meet him, and tell him he\\r\\nhad made a mistake, and beg him to go away. He would have pity on a\\r\\nwoman, on a poor woman: So I rushed to the door and opened it, just at\\r\\nthe moment when he was going to ring the bell, and I stammered out,\\r\\nquite stupidly: \\'Go away, Monsieur, go away; you have made a mistake, a\\r\\nterrible mistake; I took you for one of my friends whom you are very\\r\\nlike. Have pity on me, Monsieur.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he only began to laugh, my dear, and replied: \\'Good morning, my\\r\\ndear, I know all about your little story, you may be sure. You are\\r\\nmarried, and so you want forty francs instead of twenty, and you shall\\r\\nhave them, so just show the way.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he pushed me in, closed the door, and as I remained standing\\r\\nbefore him, horror-struck, he kissed me, put his arm round my waist and\\r\\nmade me go back into the drawing-room, which had remained open. Then he\\r\\nbegan to look at everything, like an auctioneer, and continued: \\'By\\r\\nJove, it is very nice in your rooms, very well. You must be very down on\\r\\nyour luck just now, to do the window business!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I began to beg him again: \\'Oh! Monsieur, go away, please go away!\\r\\nMy husband will be coming in soon, it is just his time. I swear that you\\r\\nhave made a mistake!\\' But he answered quite coolly: \\'Come, my beauty, I\\r\\nhave had enough of this nonsense, and if your husband comes in, I will\\r\\ngive him five francs to go and have a drink at the café opposite.\\' And\\r\\nthen, seeing Raoul\\'s photograph on the chimney-piece, he asked me: \\'Is\\r\\nthat your ... your husband?\\' \\'Yes, that is he.\\' \\'He looks a nice,\\r\\ndisagreeable sort of fellow. And who is this? One of your friends?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was your photograph, my dear, you know, the one in ball dress. I did\\r\\nnot know any longer what I was saying, and I stammered: \\'Yes, it is one\\r\\nof my friends.\\' \\'She is very nice; you shall introduce me to her.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then the clock struck five, and Raoul comes home every day at half\\r\\npast! Suppose he were to come home before the other had gone, just fancy\\r\\nwhat would have happened! Then ... then ... I completely lost my head\\r\\n... altogether.... I thought ... I thought ... that ... that ... the\\r\\nbest thing would be ... to get rid ... of ... of this man ... as quickly\\r\\nas possible.... The sooner it was over ... you understand ... and ...\\r\\nand there ... as it must be done ... and I was obliged, my dear ... he\\r\\nwould not have gone away without it.... Well I ... I locked the\\r\\ndrawing-room door.... There!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon had begun to laugh, to laugh madly,\\r\\nwith her head buried in her pillow, so that the whole bed shook, and\\r\\nwhen she was a little calmer she asked: \"And ... and ... was he\\r\\ngood-looking?\" \"Yes.\" \"And yet you complain?\" \"But ... but ... don\\'t you\\r\\nsee, my dear, he said ... he said ... he should come again to-morrow ...\\r\\nat the same time ... and I ... I am terribly frightened.... You have no\\r\\nidea how tenacious he is and obstinate.... What can I do ... tell me ...\\r\\nwhat can I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness sat up in bed to reflect, and then she suddenly\\r\\nsaid: \"Have him arrested!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness looked stupefied, and stammered out: \"What do you\\r\\nsay? What are you thinking of? Have him arrested? Under what pretext?\"\\r\\n\"That is very simple. Go to the Commissary of Police and say that a\\r\\ngentleman has been following you about for three months; that he had the\\r\\ninsolence to go up to your apartments yesterday; that he has threatened\\r\\nyou with another visit to-morrow, and that you demand the protection of\\r\\nthe law, and they will give you two police officers, who will arrest\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, suppose he tells....\" \"They will not believe him, you\\r\\nsilly thing, if you have told your tale cleverly to the commissary, but\\r\\nthey will believe you, who are an irreproachable woman, and in\\r\\nsociety.\" \"Oh! I shall never dare to do it.\" \"You must dare, my dear, or\\r\\nyou are lost.\" \"But think that he will ... he will insult me if he is\\r\\narrested.\" \"Very well, you will have witnesses, and he will be\\r\\nsentenced.\" \"Sentenced to what?\" \"To pay damages. In such cases, one\\r\\nmust be pitiless!\" \"Ah! speaking of damages.... There is one thing that\\r\\nworries me very much ... very much indeed.... He left me two twenty\\r\\nfranc pieces on the mantelpiece.\" \"Two twenty franc pieces?\" \"Yes.\" \"No\\r\\nmore?\" \"No.\" \"That is very little. It would have humiliated me. Well?\"\\r\\n\"Well! What am I to do with that money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness hesitated for a few seconds, and then she replied\\r\\nin a serious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear ... you must make ... you must make your husband a little\\r\\npresent with it.... That will be only fair!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DEVIL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was standing opposite the doctor, by the bedside of the\\r\\ndying old woman, and she, calmly resigned and quite lucid, looked at\\r\\nthem and listened to their talking. She was going to die, and she did\\r\\nnot rebel at it, for her time was over, as she was ninety-two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its\\r\\nhot flames onto the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down\\r\\nby four generations of clod-hoppers. The smell of the fields came in\\r\\nalso, driven by the sharp wind, and parched by the noontide heat. The\\r\\ngrasshoppers chirped themselves hoarse, and filled the country with\\r\\ntheir shrill noise, which was like that of the wooden crickets which are\\r\\nsold to children at fair time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor raised his voice and said: \"Honoré, you cannot leave your\\r\\nmother in this state; she may die at any moment.\" And the peasant, in\\r\\ngreat distress replied: \"But I must get in my wheat, for it has been\\r\\nlying on the ground a long time, and the weather is just right for it;\\r\\nwhat do you say about it, mother?\" And the dying old woman, still\\r\\ntormented by her Norman avariciousness, replied _yes_ with her eyes and\\r\\nher forehead, and so urged her son to get in his wheat, and to leave her\\r\\nto die alone, but the doctor got angry, and stamping his foot, he said:\\r\\n\"You are no better than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you\\r\\nto do it, do you understand? And if you must get in your wheat to-day,\\r\\ngo and fetch Rapet\\'s wife and make her look after your mother. I will\\r\\nhave it, do you understand me? And if you do not obey me, I will let you\\r\\ndie like a dog, when you are ill in your turn; do you hear me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was tormented\\r\\nby indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his fierce love of saving,\\r\\nhesitated, calculated and stammered out: \"How much does la Rapet charge\\r\\nfor attending sick people?\" \"How should I know?\" the doctor cried. \"That\\r\\ndepends upon how long she is wanted for. Settle it with her, by Jove!\\r\\nBut I want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the man made up his mind: \"I will go for her,\" he replied; \"don\\'t get\\r\\nangry, doctor.\" And the latter left, calling out as he went: \"Take care,\\r\\nyou know, for I do not joke when I am angry!\" And as soon as they were\\r\\nalone, the peasant turned to his mother and said in a resigned voice: \"I\\r\\nwill go and fetch la Rapet, as the man will have it. Don\\'t go off while\\r\\nI am away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went out in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet, who was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the dying of\\r\\nthe neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sown her customers into\\r\\nthat linen cloth from which they would emerge no more, she went and took\\r\\nup her iron to smooth the linen of the living. Wrinkled like a last\\r\\nyear\\'s apple, spiteful, envious, avaricious with a phenomenal avarice,\\r\\nbent double, as if she had been broken in half across the loins, by the\\r\\nconstant movement of the iron over the linen, one might have said that\\r\\nshe had a kind of monstrous and cynical affection for a death struggle.\\r\\nShe never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of the\\r\\nvarious kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and she related\\r\\nwith the greatest minuteness, details which were always the same, just\\r\\nlike a sportsman recounts his shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Honoré Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing the\\r\\nstarch for the collars of the village women, and he said: \"Good evening;\\r\\nI hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head round to look at him, and said: \"Fairly well, fairly\\r\\nwell, and you?\" \"Oh! as for me, I am as well as I could wish, but my\\r\\nmother is very poorly.\" \"Your mother?\" \"Yes, my mother!\" \"What\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her?\" \"She is going to turn up her toes, that\\'s what\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with sudden\\r\\nsympathy: \"Is she as bad as all that?\" \"The doctor says she will not\\r\\nlast till morning.\" \"Then she certainly is very bad!\" Honoré hesitated,\\r\\nfor he wanted to make a few preambulatory remarks before coming to his\\r\\nproposal, but as he could hit upon nothing, he made up his mind\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much are you going to ask to stop with her till the end? You know\\r\\nthat I am not rich, and I cannot even afford to keep a servant-girl. It\\r\\nis just that which has brought my poor mother to this state, too much\\r\\nwork and fatigue! She used to work for ten, in spite of her ninety-two\\r\\nyears. You don\\'t find any made of that stuff nowadays!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet answered gravely: \"There are two prices: Forty sous by day and\\r\\nthree francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by day, and forty by\\r\\nnight for the others. You shall pay me the twenty and forty.\" But the\\r\\npeasant reflected, for he knew his mother well. He knew how tenacious of\\r\\nlife, vigorous and unyielding she was, and she might last another week,\\r\\nin spite of the doctor\\'s opinion, and so he said resolutely: \"No, I\\r\\nwould rather you would fix a price until the end. I will take my chance,\\r\\none way or the other. The doctor says she will die very soon. If that\\r\\nhappens so much the better for you, and so much the worse for me, but if\\r\\nshe holds out till to-morrow or longer, so much the better for me and so\\r\\nmuch the worse for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a\\r\\ndeath as a speculative job, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of\\r\\nthe possible gain, but almost immediately she suspected that he wanted\\r\\nto juggle her, \"I can say nothing until I have seen your mother,\" she\\r\\nreplied. \"Then come with me and see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe washed her hands, and went with him immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps,\\r\\nwhile he strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at\\r\\nevery step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their\\r\\nheads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them\\r\\nfor some green grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got near the house, Honoré Bontemps murmured: \"Suppose it is\\r\\nall over?\" And the unconscious wish which he had that it might be so,\\r\\nshowed itself in the sound of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her\\r\\nwretched bed, her hands covered with a pink cotton counterpane, horribly\\r\\nthin, knotty hands, like strange animals, like crabs, and closed by\\r\\nrheumatism, fatigue, and the work of nearly a century which she had\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt her\\r\\npulse, tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing, and asked her\\r\\nquestions, so as to hear her speak: and then, having looked at her for\\r\\nsome time longer, she went out of the room, followed by Honoré. Her\\r\\ndecided opinion was that the old woman would not last out the night, and\\r\\nhe asked: \"Well?\" And the sick-nurse replied: \"Well, she may last two\\r\\ndays, perhaps three. You will have to give me six francs, everything\\r\\nincluded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six francs! six francs!\" he shouted. \"Are you out of your mind? I tell\\r\\nyou that she cannot last more than five or six hours!\" And they disputed\\r\\nangrily for some time, but as the nurse said she would go home, as the\\r\\ntime was going by, and as his wheat would not come to the farmyard of\\r\\nits own accord, he agreed to her terms at last:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well then, that is settled; six francs including everything, until\\r\\nthe corpse is taken out.\" \"That is settled, six francs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went away, with long strides, to his wheat, which was lying on\\r\\nthe ground under the hot sun, which ripens the grain, while the\\r\\nsick-nurse returned to the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had brought some work with her, for she worked without stopping by\\r\\nthe side of the dead and the dying, sometimes for herself, sometimes for\\r\\nthe family which employed her as seamstress also, paying her rather\\r\\nmore in that capacity. Suddenly she asked: \"Have you received the last\\r\\nsacraments, Mother Bontemps?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old peasant woman said \"no\" with her head, and la Rapet, who was\\r\\nvery devout, got up quickly: \"Good heavens, is it possible? I will go\\r\\nand fetch the Curé;\" and she rushed off to the parsonage so quickly,\\r\\nthat the urchins in the street thought some accident had happened, when\\r\\nthey saw her trotting off like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a choir-boy,\\r\\nwho rang a bell, to announce the passage of the Host through the parched\\r\\nand quiet country. Some men, who were working at a distance, took off\\r\\ntheir large hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had\\r\\ndisappeared behind some farm buildings; the women who were making up the\\r\\nsheaves, stood up to make the sign of the cross; the frightened black\\r\\nhens ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole\\r\\nthrough which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal, which was tied up\\r\\nin a meadow, took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to turn\\r\\nround at the length of its rope, kicking violently. The choir-boy, in\\r\\nhis red cassock, walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined\\r\\ntowards one shoulder, and with his square biretta on his head, followed\\r\\nhim, muttering some prayers, and last of all came la Rapet, bent almost\\r\\ndouble, as if she wished to prostrate herself as she walked with folded\\r\\nhands, as if she were in church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonoré saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: \"Where is our priest\\r\\ngoing to?\" And his man, who was more acute, replied: \"He is taking the\\r\\nsacrament to your mother, of course!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was not surprised, and said: \"That is quite possible,\" and\\r\\nwent on with his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and communion, and the\\r\\npriest took his departure, leaving the two women alone in the\\r\\nsuffocating cottage, while la Rapet began to look at the dying woman,\\r\\nand to ask herself whether it could last much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was on the wane, and a cooler air came in stronger puffs, and\\r\\nmade a view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two pins, flap\\r\\nup and down, the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white,\\r\\nbut were now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were\\r\\ngoing to fly off and seemed to struggle to get away, like the old\\r\\nwoman\\'s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lying motionless, with her eyes open, seemed to await that death\\r\\nwhich was so near and which yet delayed its coming, with perfect\\r\\nindifference. Her short breath whistled in her tightening throat. It\\r\\nwould stop altogether soon, and there would be one woman less in the\\r\\nworld, whom nobody would regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nightfall Honoré returned, and when he went up to the bed and saw\\r\\nthat his mother was still alive, he asked: \"How is she?\" just as he had\\r\\ndone formerly, when she had been unwell, and then he sent la Rapet away,\\r\\nsaying to her: \"To-morrow morning at five o\\'clock, without fail.\" And\\r\\nshe replied: \"To-morrow, at five o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came at daybreak, and found Honoré eating his soup, which he had\\r\\nmade himself, before going to work, and the sick-nurse asked him: \"Well,\\r\\nis your mother dead?\" \"She is rather better, on the contrary,\" he\\r\\nreplied, with a malignant look out of the corner of his eyes. And he\\r\\nwent out.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was seized with anxiety, and went up to the dying woman, who\\r\\nremained in the same state, lethargic and impassive, with her eyes open\\r\\nand her hands clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that this\\r\\nmight go on thus for two days, four days, eight days, and her avaricious\\r\\nmind was seized with fear, while she was excited to furious rage against\\r\\nthe cunning fellow who had tricked her, and against the woman, who would\\r\\nnot die.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she began to work and waited with her looks fixed on the\\r\\nwrinkled face of Mother Bontemps, and when Honoré returned to breakfast\\r\\nhe seemed quite satisfied and even in a bantering humor, for he was\\r\\ndecidedly carrying in his wheat under very favorable circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was getting exasperated; every minute passed now seemed to her\\r\\nso much time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad inclination to\\r\\ntake this old ass, this headstrong old fool, this obstinate old wretch,\\r\\nand to stop that short, rapid breath, which was robbing her of her time\\r\\nand money, by squeezing her throat a little. But then, she reflected on\\r\\nthe danger of doing so, and other thoughts came into her head, so she\\r\\nwent up to the bed and said to her: \"Have you ever seen the Devil?\"\\r\\nMother Bontemps whispered: \"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales which were\\r\\nlikely to terrify her weak and dying mind. Some minutes before one died\\r\\nthe Devil appeared, she said, to all who were in their death throes. He\\r\\nhad a broom in his hand, a saucepan on his head, and he uttered loud\\r\\ncries. When anybody had seen him, all was over, and that person had only\\r\\na few moments longer to live; and she enumerated all those to whom the\\r\\nDevil had appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie Ratier, Sophie\\r\\nPadagnau, Séraphine Grospied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps, who was at last most disturbed in mind, moved about,\\r\\nwrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look at the bottom of the\\r\\nroom, and suddenly la Rapet disappeared at the foot of the bed. She took\\r\\na sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped herself up in it; she put the\\r\\niron pot onto her head, so that its three short bent feet rose up like\\r\\nhorns, and she took a broom in her right hand and a tin pail in her\\r\\nleft, which she threw up suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground\\r\\nnoisily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd certainly when it came down, it made a terrible noise; then,\\r\\nclimbing onto a chair, the nurse lifted up the curtain which hung at the\\r\\nbottom of the bed, and showed herself, gesticulating and uttering shrill\\r\\ncries into the pot which covered her face, while she menaced the old\\r\\npeasant woman, who was nearly dead, with her broom.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, with a mad look on her face, the dying woman made a\\r\\nsuperhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her shoulders and\\r\\nchest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep sigh. All was over, and\\r\\nla Rapet calmly put everything back into its place; the broom into the\\r\\ncorner by the cupboard, the sheet inside it, the pot on the hearth, the\\r\\npail on the floor and the chair against the wall. Then, with\\r\\nprofessional movements, she closed the dead woman\\'s enormous eyes, put\\r\\na plate on the bed and poured some holy water into it, dipped the twig\\r\\nof boxwood into it, and kneeling down, she fervently repeated the\\r\\nprayers for the dead, which she knew by heart, as a matter of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Honoré returned in the evening, he found her praying, and he\\r\\ncalculated immediately that she had made twenty sous out of him, for she\\r\\nhad only spent three days and one night there, which made five francs\\r\\naltogether, instead of the six which he owed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPIPHANY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Captain Count de Garens, \"I should rather think that I do\\r\\nremember it, that supper of the Kings, during the war!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was at the time quarter-master of cavalry, and for a fortnight had\\r\\nbeen lurking about as a scout in front of the German advanced guard. The\\r\\nevening before we had cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one\\r\\nof whom was that poor little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de\\r\\nRaudeville well, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on that day my captain ordered me to take six troopers and to go\\r\\nand occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five fights in\\r\\nthree weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty houses left\\r\\nstanding, not a dozen houses in that wasp\\'s nest. So I took ten\\r\\ntroopers, and set out at about four o\\'clock and at five o\\'clock, while\\r\\nit was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I\\r\\nhalted and ordered Marchas, you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterwards\\r\\nmarried little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de\\r\\nMartel-Auvelin, to go alone into the village, and to report to me what\\r\\nhe saw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had chosen nothing but volunteers, and all of good family. It is\\r\\npleasant when on service not to be forced to be on intimate terms with\\r\\nunpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as sharp as possible, as cunning as\\r\\na fox and as supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as well\\r\\nas a dog can scent a hare, could find victuals where we should have\\r\\ndied of hunger without him, and he obtained information from everybody,\\r\\nand information which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In ten minutes he returned. \\'All right,\\' he said; \\'there have been no\\r\\nPrussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is this village.\\r\\nI have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is attending to four or\\r\\nfive wounded men in an abandoned convent.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ordered them to ride on, and we penetrated into the principal street.\\r\\nOn the right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were\\r\\nhardly visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was\\r\\nburning in a room; some family had remained to keep its house standing\\r\\nas much as they were able; a family of brave, or of poor, people. The\\r\\nrain had begun to fall, a fine, icy cold rain, which froze us before it\\r\\nwetted us through, by merely touching our cloaks. The horses stumbled\\r\\nagainst stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided us,\\r\\ngoing before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where are you taking us to?\\' I asked him. And he replied: \\'I have a\\r\\nplace for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.\\' And soon we stopped\\r\\nbefore a small house, evidently belonging to some owner of the middle\\r\\nclasses, quite enclosed, built near the street and with a garden in the\\r\\nrear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marchas broke open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up\\r\\nnear the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front\\r\\ndoor with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was\\r\\nnever without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of\\r\\nsome rich private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as\\r\\nif he had lived in this house which he now saw for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to stout Ponderel, who followed him: \\'The stables must be on the\\r\\nleft; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we\\r\\ndo not want them,\\' and then turning to me he said: \\'Give your orders,\\r\\nconfound it all!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: \\'I shall\\r\\npost my sentinels at the country approaches and I will return to you\\r\\nhere?\\' \\'How many man men are you going to take?\\' \\'Five. The others will\\r\\nrelieve them at five o\\'clock in the evening.\\' \\'Very well. Leave me four\\r\\nto look after provisions, to do the cooking and to set the table. I will\\r\\ngo and find out where the wine is hidden away.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went off, to reconnoiter the deserted streets, until they ended in\\r\\nthe open country, so as to post my sentries there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Half an hour later I was back, and I found Marchas lounging in a great\\r\\narmchair, the covering of which he had taking off, from love of luxury\\r\\nas he said. He was warming his feet at the fire, and smoking an\\r\\nexcellent cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows\\r\\nresting on the arms of the chair, his shoulders, his cheeks flushed, his\\r\\neyes bright, and looking delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to me, smiling in a beatific manner: \\'This is famous; I found the\\r\\nchampagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy--fifty bottles\\r\\nof the very finest--in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which did\\r\\nnot look to me to be quite straight, when I looked at it by the light\\r\\nof my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck and\\r\\nthree pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful\\r\\npart of the country.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had sat down opposite to him, and the fire in the grate was burning\\r\\nmy nose and cheeks. \\'Where did you find this wood?\\' I asked. \\'Splendid\\r\\nwood,\\' he replied. \\'The owner\\'s carriage. It is the paint which is\\r\\ncausing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A capital\\r\\nhouse!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I laughed for I found the creature was funny, and he went on: \\'Fancy\\r\\nthis being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose, but there\\r\\nis no queen; it is really very annoying!\\' And I repeated like an echo:\\r\\n\\'It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the matter?\\' \\'To find\\r\\nsome, of course. Some women,\\' \\'Women?... you must be mad?\\' \\'I managed to\\r\\nfind the brandy under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps;\\r\\nand yet there was nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is\\r\\na sure sign. Go and look, old fellow.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was\\r\\njoking or not, and so I replied: \\'Look here, Marchas, are you having a\\r\\njoke with me?\\' \\'I never joke on duty.\\' \\'But where the devil do you\\r\\nexpect me to find any women?\\' \\'Where you like, there must be two or\\r\\nthree remaining in the neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them\\r\\nhere.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas went on:\\r\\n\\'Do you want an idea?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'Go and see the priest.\\' \\'The priest? What\\r\\nfor?\\' \\'Ask him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.\\' \\'The\\r\\npriest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity; \\'I am not laughing,\\r\\ngo and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as his\\r\\nmust be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one woman\\r\\nat least, a lady, of course, since we are all men of the world. He is\\r\\nsure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if\\r\\nthere is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will indicate her to\\r\\nyou.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?\\' \\'My dear Garens, you\\r\\ncan do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We are well bred, by\\r\\njove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners and our grandest\\r\\nstyle. Tell the Abbé who we are, make him laugh, soften him, seduce him\\r\\nand persuade him!\\' \\'No, it is impossible.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my weak side, the scamp\\r\\ncontinued: \\'Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to do, and how\\r\\namusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and it will\\r\\ngive you a famous reputation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and so he persisted:\\r\\n\\'Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and you\\r\\nalone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood. I\\r\\nbeg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war, I will relate\\r\\nthe whole affair in verse in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. You owe this\\r\\nmuch to your men, for you have made them march enough during the last\\r\\nmonth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up at last and asked: \\'Where is the parsonage?\\' \\'Take the second\\r\\nturning at the end of the street, you will see an avenue, and at the end\\r\\nof the avenue you will find the church. The parsonage is beside it.\\' As\\r\\nI went out, he called out: \\'Tell him the bill of fare, to make him\\r\\nhungry!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I discovered the ecclesiastic\\'s little house without any difficulty; it\\r\\nwas by the side of a large, ugly, brick church. I knocked at the door\\r\\nwith my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice\\r\\nfrom inside asked: \\'Who is there?\\' To which I replied: \\'A quarter-master\\r\\nof the hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and I found\\r\\nmyself face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest\\r\\nof a prize-fighter, formidable hands projecting from turned up sleeves,\\r\\na red face and the looks of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and\\r\\nsaid: \\'Good day, Monsieur le Curé.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had feared a surprise, some marauders\\' ambush, and he smiled as he\\r\\nreplied: \\'Good day, my friend; come in.\\' I followed him into a small\\r\\nroom with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very\\r\\ndifferent to Marchas\\' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: \\'What\\r\\ncan I do for you?\\' \\'Monsieur, allow me first of all to introduce\\r\\nmyself;\\' and I gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: _The\\r\\nComte de Garens_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I continued: \\'There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l\\'Abbé, five on\\r\\ngrand guard, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant.\\r\\nThe names of the six are, Garens, (that is I), Pierre de Marchas,\\r\\nLudovic de Ponderel, Baron d\\'Etreillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter\\'s\\r\\nson and Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in\\r\\ntheir name and my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an\\r\\nEpiphany supper, Monsieur le Curé, and we should like to make it a\\r\\nlittle cheerful.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest smiled and murmured: \\'It seems to me to be hardly a suitable\\r\\noccasion for amusing oneself.\\' And I replied: \\'We are fighting every\\r\\nday, Monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been killed in a month, and\\r\\nthree fell, as late as yesterday. That is war. We stake our lives every\\r\\nmoment, have we not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves freely? We\\r\\nare Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere. Our\\r\\nfathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to brighten\\r\\nourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like soldiers; you\\r\\nunderstand me, I hope. Are we wrong?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He replied quickly: \\'You are quite right, my friend, and I accept your\\r\\ninvitation with great pleasure.\\' Then he called out: \\'Hermance!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An old bent, wrinkled, horrible, peasant woman appeared and said: \\'What\\r\\ndo you want?\\' \\'I shall not dine at home, my daughter.\\' \\'Where are you\\r\\ngoing to dine then?\\' \\'With some gentlemen, hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt inclined to say: \\'Bring your servant with you, just to see\\r\\nMarchas\\'s face,\\' but I did not venture to, but continued: \\'Do you know\\r\\nanyone among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite as\\r\\nwell?\\' He hesitated, reflected, and then said: \\'No, I do not know\\r\\nanybody!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I persisted: \\'Nobody! Come, Monsieur, think; It would be very nice to\\r\\nhave some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing\\r\\nabout your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the ... the\\r\\n... the ... watchmaker ... the ... shoemaker ... the ... the chemist\\r\\nwith Mrs. chemist.... We have a good spread, and plenty of wine, and we\\r\\nshould be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves behind\\r\\nus, with the people here.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest thought again for a long time, and then resolutely: \\'No,\\r\\nthere is nobody.\\' I began to laugh. \\'By Jove, Monsieur le Curé, it is\\r\\nvery vexing not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come,\\r\\nthink. Is there not a married Mayor, or a married Deputy-Mayor, or a\\r\\nmarried Municipal Concilor or schoolmaster?\\' \\'No, all the ladies have\\r\\ngone away.\\' \\'What, is there not in the whole place some good tradesman\\'s\\r\\nwife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this pleasure, for\\r\\nit would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure under present\\r\\ncircumstances?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suddenly the Curé began to laugh, and he laughed so violently that\\r\\nhe fairly shook. And exclaimed: \\'Ha! ha! ha! I have got what you want,\\r\\nyes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and enjoy\\r\\nourselves, my children, we will have some fun. How pleased the ladies\\r\\nwill be, I say, how delighted they will be. Ha! ha!... Where are you\\r\\nstaying?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I described the house, and he understood where it was. \\'Very good,\\' he\\r\\nsaid. \\'It belongs to Monsieur Bertin Lavaille. I will be there in half\\r\\nan hour, with four ladies!!!... Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!!!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating; \\'That is\\r\\ncapital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille\\'s house.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. \\'Covers\\r\\nfor how many?\\' Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. \\'Eleven. There are\\r\\nsix of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.\\' He was\\r\\nthunderstruck, and I triumphant, and he repeated: \\'Four ladies! Did you\\r\\nsay, four ladies?\\' \\'I said: four women.\\' \\'Real women?\\' \\'Real women.\\'\\r\\n\\'Well accept my compliments!\\' \\'I will, for I deserve them.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He got out of his armchair, opened the door and I saw a beautiful,\\r\\nwhite tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue\\r\\naprons were setting out the plates and glasses. \\'There are some women\\r\\ncoming!\\' Marchas cried. And three men began to dance and to cheer with\\r\\nall their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an\\r\\nhour, while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house.\\r\\nAt last, however, a knock against the shutters, made us all jump up at\\r\\nthe same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a\\r\\nminute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,\\r\\nwrinkled and timid, and successively saluted the four bewildered hussars\\r\\nwho saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled\\r\\nfloor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other\\r\\none by one, who came in balancing themselves with different movements,\\r\\none canting to the right, while the other canted to the left. And three\\r\\nworthy women showed themselves, limping, dragging their legs behind\\r\\nthem, crippled by illness and deformed through old age, three infirm old\\r\\nwomen, past service, the only three pensioners in the establishment\\r\\nwhich Sister Saint-Benedict managed, who were able to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and\\r\\nthen seeing my quarter-master\\'s stripes, she said to me: \\'I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little\\r\\npleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat\\r\\nand doing them a great honor.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw the priest, who had remained in the obscurity of the passage, and\\r\\nwho was laughing heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially\\r\\nwhen I saw Marchas\\'s face. Then motioning the nun to the seats I said:\\r\\n\\'Sit down, Sister: we are very proud and very happy that you have\\r\\naccepted our unpretentious invitation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the\\r\\nfire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their\\r\\nsticks and shawls which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the\\r\\nfirst, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently\\r\\nsuffering from the dropsy, she said: \\'This is Mother Paumelle, whose\\r\\nhusband was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa;\\r\\nshe is sixty years old.\\' Then she pointed to another, a tall woman,\\r\\nwhose head trembled unceasingly: \\'This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is\\r\\nsixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a\\r\\nfire, and her right leg was half burnt off.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,\\r\\nstupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions. \\'This is la\\r\\nPutois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bowed to the three women as if I were presented to some Royal\\r\\nHighness, and turning to the priest I said: \\'You are an excellent man\\r\\nMonsieur l\\'Abbé, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious and\\r\\njust then Karl Massouligny cried: \\'Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is on\\r\\nthe table!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,\\r\\nwhose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy\\r\\ntask, for her swollen stomach seemed heavier than a lump of iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stout Ponderel gave her arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her\\r\\ncrutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, la Putois to the\\r\\ndining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as we were opposite our plates, the Sister clapped her hands\\r\\nthree times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the\\r\\nwomen made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly\\r\\nrepeated the _Benedictus_ in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls\\r\\nappeared, brought in by Marchas, who chose to wait on them, as to sit\\r\\ndown as a guest, to this ridiculous repast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I cried: \\'Bring the champagne at once!\\' and a cork flew out with\\r\\nthe noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the priest and\\r\\nthe kind Sister, the three hussars sitting by the side of the three\\r\\ninvalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats, by force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and\\r\\non being on good terms with everyone, wherever he was, made love to\\r\\nMother Paumelle, in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had\\r\\nretained her cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him\\r\\nbanteringly in a high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put\\r\\non, and she laughed so heartily at her neighbor\\'s jokes, that her large\\r\\nstomach looked as if it were going to rise up and get onto the table.\\r\\nLittle Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot\\r\\ndrunk, and Baron d\\'Etreillis whose wits were not always particularly\\r\\nsharp, was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the\\r\\nrules in the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The nun said to Massouligny in consternation: \\'Oh! oh! you will make\\r\\nher ill; pray do not make her laugh like that, Monsieur. Oh!\\r\\nMonsieur....\\' Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take a full glass\\r\\nout of his hands which he was hastily emptying down la Putois\\' throat,\\r\\nwhile the priest shook with laughter, and said to the Sister: \\'Never\\r\\nmind, just this once, it will not hurt her. Do leave them alone.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three\\r\\npigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,\\r\\ngolden-colored, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned fat meat. La\\r\\nPaumelle who was getting lively, clapped her hands; la Jean-Jean left\\r\\noff answering the Baron\\'s numerous questions, and la Putois uttered\\r\\ngrunts of pleasure, half cries and half sighs, like little children do\\r\\nwhen one shows them sweets. \\'Allow me to take charge of this animal,\\'\\r\\nthe _Curé_ said. \\'I understand these sort of operations better than most\\r\\npeople.\\' \\'Certainly, Monsieur l\\'Abbé,\\' and the Sister said: \\'How would\\r\\nit be to open the window a little; they are too warm, and I am afraid\\r\\nthey will be ill.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I turned to Marchas: \\'Open the window for a minute.\\' He did so, the\\r\\ncold outer air as it came in, made the candles flare, and the smoke\\r\\nfrom the goose, which the _Curé_ was scientifically carving, with a\\r\\ntable napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it,\\r\\nwithout speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive\\r\\nhandiwork, and seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that\\r\\nenormous golden-colored bird, whose limbs fell one after another into\\r\\nthe brown gravy at the bottom of the dish. And at that moment, in the\\r\\nmidst of that greedy silence which kept us all attentive, the distant\\r\\nreport of a shot came in at the open window.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started to my feet so quickly, that my chair fell down behind me, and\\r\\nI shouted: \\'Mount, all of you! You, Marchas, will take two men and go\\r\\nand see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.\\' And\\r\\nwhile the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I got\\r\\ninto the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps\\r\\nof the villa, while the _Curé_, the Sister and the three old women\\r\\nshowed their frightened faces at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The\\r\\nrain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop\\r\\nof a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called\\r\\nout to him: \\'Well?\\' \\'It is nothing; François has wounded an old peasant\\r\\nwho refused to answer his challenge: \"Who goes there?\" and who continued\\r\\nto advance, in spite of the order to keep off; but they are bringing him\\r\\nhere, and we shall see what is the matter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I gave orders for the horses to be put back into the stable, and I sent\\r\\nmy two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the\\r\\n_Curé_, Marchas and I took a mattress into the room to put the wounded\\r\\nman on; the Sister tore up a table napkin, in order to make lint, while\\r\\nthe three frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to\\r\\nshow a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared,\\r\\ncarrying that inert, soft, long and sinister object which a human body\\r\\nbecomes when life no longer sustains it.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for\\r\\nhim, and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death\\r\\nrattle and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his\\r\\nmouth, forced out of his mouth by his gasps. The man was covered with\\r\\nit! His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to\\r\\nhave been rubbed, to have been dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck\\r\\nto him, and had become a dull color, which was horrible to look at.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old man, wrapped up in a large shepherd\\'s cloak, occasionally\\r\\nopened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment,\\r\\nlike those of animals which a sportsman kills, and which fall at his\\r\\nfeet, more than half dead already, stupefied with fear and astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ exclaimed: \\'Ah! there is old Placide, the shepherd, from les\\r\\nMarlins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh God! they have\\r\\nkilled the unhappy man!\\' The Sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and\\r\\nwas looking at a little blue hole in the middle of his chest, which was\\r\\nnot bleeding any more. \\'There is nothing to be done,\\' she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last\\r\\nbreath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could\\r\\nhear an ominous and continued gurgling. The Curé, standing in front of\\r\\nhim, raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow\\r\\nand solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men\\'s souls,\\r\\nbut before they were finished the old man was shaken by a rapid shock,\\r\\nas if something had broken inside him; he no longer breathed. He was\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than\\r\\nthe death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were\\r\\nstanding up huddled close together; hideous, and grimacing with fear and\\r\\nhorror. I went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while\\r\\nla Jean-Jean, whose leg had been burnt, and could not longer support\\r\\nher, fell to the ground at full length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old\\r\\nwomen, and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round\\r\\nthem, gave them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go\\r\\nout, and disappeared with them into the dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere\\r\\nrattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ was still looking at the dead man; but at last he turned\\r\\nround to me and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh! What a horrible thing!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN THE WOOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was just going to sit down to breakfast, when he was told that\\r\\nthe rural policeman was waiting for him at the Mansion-house with two\\r\\nprisoners, and he went there immediately, and found old Hochedur\\r\\nstanding up and watching a middle-class couple of mature years, with a\\r\\nsevere look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, a fat old fellow with a red nose and white hair, seemed utterly\\r\\ndejected; while the woman, a little roundabout, fat woman, with shining\\r\\ncheeks, looked at the agent of the authorities who had arrested them,\\r\\nwith defiant eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it? What is it? Hochedur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rural policeman made his deposition: He had gone out that morning at\\r\\nhis usual time, in order to go on his beat from the forest of Champioux\\r\\nas far as the boundaries of Argenteuil. He had not noticed anything\\r\\nunusual in the country except that it was a fine day, and that the wheat\\r\\nwas doing well, when the son of old Bredel, who was going over his vines\\r\\na second time, called out to him: \"Here, Daddy Hochedur, go and have a\\r\\nlook into the skirts of the wood, in the first thicket, and you will\\r\\ncatch a pair of pigeons there that must be a hundred and thirty years\\r\\nold between them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went in the direction that had been indicated to him, and had gone\\r\\ninto the thicket, and there he heard words and gasps, which made him\\r\\nsuspect a flagrant breach of morality. Advancing, therefore, on his\\r\\nhands and knees, as if to surprise a poacher, he had arrested the couple\\r\\nwho were there present, at the very moment when they were going to\\r\\nabandon themselves to their natural instincts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor looked at the culprits in astonishment, for the man was\\r\\ncertainly sixty, and the woman fifty-five at least, and so he began to\\r\\nquestion them, beginning with the man, who replied in such a weak voice\\r\\nthat he could scarcely be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\" \"Nicolas Beaurain.\" \"Your occupation?\"\\r\\n\"Haberdasher, in the Rue des Martyrs, in Paris.\" \"What were you doing in\\r\\nthe wood?\" The haberdasher remained silent, with his eyes on his fat\\r\\nstomach; and his hand resting on his thighs, and the Mayor continued:\\r\\n\"Do you deny what the officer of the municipal authorities states?\" \"No,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"So you confess it?\" \"Yes, Monsieur.\" \"What have you to say\\r\\nin your defense?\" \"Nothing, Monsieur.\" \"Where did you meet the partner\\r\\nin your misdemeanor?\" \"She is my wife, Monsieur.\" \"Your wife?\" \"Yes,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"Then ... then ... you do not live together ... in Paris?\" \"I\\r\\nbeg your pardon, Monsieur, but we are living together!\" \"But in that\\r\\ncase ... you must be mad, altogether mad, my dear sir, to get caught\\r\\nlike that, in the country at ten o\\'clock in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe haberdasher seemed ready to cry with shame, and he murmured: \"It was\\r\\nshe who enticed me! I told her it was very stupid, but when a woman has\\r\\ngot a thing into her head ... you know ... you cannot get it out of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor, who liked open speaking, smiled and replied: \"In your case,\\r\\nthe contrary ought to have happened. You would not be here, if she had\\r\\nhad the idea only in her head!\" Then Monsieur Beaurain was seized with\\r\\nrage, and turning to his wife, he said: \"Do you see to what you have\\r\\nbrought us with your poetry? And now we shall have to go before the\\r\\nCourts, at our age, for a breach of morals! And we shall have to shut up\\r\\nthe shop, sell our good will and go to some other neighborhood! That\\'s\\r\\nwhat it has come to!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Beaurain got up, and without looking at her husband, she\\r\\nexplained herself without any embarrassment, without useless modesty,\\r\\nand almost without hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, Monsieur, I know that we have made ourselves ridiculous.\\r\\nWill you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate; or rather like a\\r\\npoor woman; and I hope that you will be kind enough to send us home, and\\r\\nto spare us the disgrace of a prosecution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Years ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain\\'s acquaintance on\\r\\nSunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a draper\\'s shop, and I\\r\\nwas a young lady in a ready made clothing establishment. I remember it,\\r\\nas if it were yesterday. I used to come and spend Sundays here\\r\\noccasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Levéque, with whom I lived in\\r\\nthe Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had not. He used to\\r\\nbring us here, and one Saturday, he told me, laughing, that he should\\r\\nbring a friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he meant,\\r\\nbut I replied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous, Monsieur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and in\\r\\nthose days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to yield\\r\\nto him, and I did not yield. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a lovely\\r\\nday, the sort of day that tickles your heart. When it is fine, even now,\\r\\njust as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when I am in\\r\\nthe country I utterly lose my head. The verdure, the swallows flying so\\r\\nswiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies, the daisies, all\\r\\nthat makes me quite excited! It is like champagne when one is not used\\r\\nto it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to\\r\\npenetrate into your body by your eyes when you looked, and by your mouth\\r\\nwhen you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other every\\r\\nminute, and that gave me something to look at! Monsieur Beaurain and I\\r\\nwalked behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know\\r\\neach other they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid, and\\r\\nI liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood; it\\r\\nwas as cool as in a bath there, and we all four sat down. Rose and her\\r\\nlover joked me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand\\r\\nthat could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug again,\\r\\nwithout putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had not\\r\\nbeen there; and then they whispered together, and then got up and went\\r\\noff among the trees, without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked\\r\\nlike, alone with this young fellow, whom I saw for the first time. I\\r\\nfelt so confused at seeing them go that it gave me courage and I began\\r\\nto talk. I asked him what his business was, and he said he was a linen\\r\\ndraper\\'s assistant, as I told you just now. We talked for a few minutes\\r\\nand that made him bold, and he wanted to take liberties with me, but I\\r\\ntold him sharply to keep his own place. Is not that true, Monsieur\\r\\nBeaurain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Beaurain, who was looking at his feet in confusion, did not\\r\\nreply, and she continued: \"Then he saw that I was virtuous, and he began\\r\\nto make love to me nicely, like an honorable man, and from that time he\\r\\ncame every Sunday, for he was very much in love with me. I was very fond\\r\\nof him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow, formerly,\\r\\nand in short he married me the next September, and we started in\\r\\nbusiness in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a hard struggle for some years, Monsieur. Business did not\\r\\nprosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and then we\\r\\nhad grown unaccustomed to them. One has other things in one\\'s head, and\\r\\nthinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in\\r\\nbusiness. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like\\r\\nquiet people who do not think much about love. One does not regret\\r\\nanything as long as one does not notice what one has lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And after that, Monsieur, business went better, and we became tranquil\\r\\nas to the future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what passed\\r\\nwithin me, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little\\r\\nboarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers\\r\\nwhich are drawn about the streets, made me cry; the smell of violets\\r\\nsought me out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart\\r\\nbeat! Then I used to get up and go onto the doorstep to look at the\\r\\nblue sky between the roofs. When one looks at the sky from a street, it\\r\\nlooks like a river which descends on Paris, winding as it flows, and the\\r\\nswallows pass to and fro in it like fish. This sort of things is very\\r\\nstupid at my age! But what can one do, Monsieur? when one has worked all\\r\\none\\'s life? A moment comes in which one perceives that one could have\\r\\ndone something else, and then, one regrets, oh! yes, one feels great\\r\\nregret! Just think that for twenty years I might have gone and had\\r\\nkisses in the woods, like other women. I used to think how delightful it\\r\\nwould be to lie under the trees, loving some one! And I thought of it\\r\\neveryday and every night! I dreamt of the moonlight on the water, until\\r\\nI felt inclined to drown myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not venture to speak to Monsieur Beaurain about this at first. I\\r\\nknew that he would make fun of me, and send me back to sell my needles\\r\\nand cotton! And then, to speak the truth, Monsieur Beaurain never said\\r\\nmuch to me, but when I looked in the glass, I also understood quite\\r\\nwell, that I also no longer appealed to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I made up my mind, and I proposed an excursion into the country\\r\\nto him, to the place where we had first become acquainted. He agreed\\r\\nwithout any distrust, and we arrived here this morning, about nine\\r\\no\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt quite young again when I got among the corn, for a woman\\'s heart\\r\\nnever grows old! And really, I no longer saw my husband as he is at\\r\\npresent, but just like he was formerly! That I will swear to you,\\r\\nMonsieur. As true as I am standing here, I was intoxicated. I began to\\r\\nkiss him, and he was more surprised than if I had tried to murder him.\\r\\nHe kept saying to me: \\'Why, you must be mad! You are mad this morning!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with you?...\\' I did not listen to him, I only\\r\\nlistened to my own heart, and I made him come into the woods with me....\\r\\nThere it is.... I have spoken the truth, Monsieur le Maire, the whole\\r\\ntruth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was a sensible man. He rose from his chair, smiled, and said:\\r\\n\"Go in peace, Madame, and sin no more ... under the trees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to see my friend Simon Radevin once more, whom I had not had\\r\\na sight of for fifteen years. Formerly he used to be my most intimate\\r\\nfriend, and I used to spend long, quiet and happy evenings with him; he\\r\\nwas one of those men to whom one tells one\\'s most intimate affairs of\\r\\nthe heart, for whom one finds, when conversing tranquilly, rare, clever,\\r\\ningenious and refined thoughts, which excite the mind and put it at its\\r\\nease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, traveled,\\r\\nthought and dreamt together; had liked the same things with the same\\r\\nliking, had admired the same books, comprehended the same works,\\r\\nshivered with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same\\r\\nindividuals, whom we understood completely, by merely exchanging a\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he married; quite unexpectedly he married a little girl from the\\r\\nprovinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How ever could\\r\\nthat little, thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light,\\r\\nvacant eyes, and her clear silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred\\r\\nthousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever\\r\\nyoung fellow? Can anyone understand these things? No doubt he had hoped\\r\\nfor happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of\\r\\na good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the\\r\\ntransparent looks of that school girl with light hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not dreamt of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man\\r\\ngrows tired as soon as he has comprehended the stupid reality, unless\\r\\nindeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing more\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light\\r\\nhearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor through\\r\\nprovincial life? A man can change a great deal in the course of fifteen\\r\\nyears!\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage,\\r\\na stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to\\r\\nme with open arms, exclaiming: \"George!\" I embraced him, but I had not\\r\\nrecognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \"By Jove! You have not\\r\\ngrown thin!\" And he replied with a laugh: \"What did you expect? Good\\r\\nliving, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my\\r\\nexistence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him closely, trying to find the features I held so dear in\\r\\nthat broad face. His eyes alone had not altered, but I no longer saw the\\r\\nsame looks in them, and I said to myself: \"If the looks be the\\r\\nreflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used\\r\\nto be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of pleasure and friendship, but they had\\r\\nnot that clear, intelligent expression, which expresses as much as words\\r\\ndo, the value of the mind. Suddenly he said to me: \"Here are my two\\r\\neldest children.\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy\\r\\nof thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a _Lycée_, came forward in a\\r\\nhesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \"Are they\\r\\nyours?\" \"Of course they are,\" he replied laughing. \"How many have you?\"\\r\\n\"Five! There are three more indoors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I\\r\\nfelt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt for this\\r\\nvainglorious and simple reproducer of his species, who spent his nights\\r\\nin his country house in making children.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got into a carriage, which he drove himself, and we set off through\\r\\nthe town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town, where nothing was moving in the\\r\\nstreets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there\\r\\na shopkeeper standing at his door took off his hat, and Simon returned\\r\\nhis salute and told me the man\\'s name; no doubt to show me that he knew\\r\\nall the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was\\r\\nthinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream\\r\\nof all who have buried themselves in the provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden,\\r\\nwhich had some pretensions to being a park, and stopped in front of a\\r\\nturretted house, which tried to pass for a château.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is my den,\" Simon said, so that he might be complimented on it,\\r\\nand I replied that it was delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed up for a visitor, her hair done\\r\\nfor a visitor, and with phrases ready prepared for a visitor. She was no\\r\\nlonger the light haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years\\r\\npreviously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies\\r\\nwithout any fixed age, without intellect, without any of those things\\r\\nwhich constitute a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout,\\r\\ncommonplace mother, the human layer and brood mare, that machine of\\r\\nflesh which procreates without any other mental preoccupation, except\\r\\nher children and her housekeeping book.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged\\r\\naccording to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen\\r\\nbefore a mayor, and I said: \"Ah! ah! so these are the others?\" And\\r\\nSimon, who was radiant with pleasure, named them: \"Jean, Sophie and\\r\\nGontran.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in and in the depths of an\\r\\neasy-chair I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man.\\r\\nMadame Radevin came forward and said: \"This is my grandfather,\\r\\nMonsieur; he is eighty-seven.\" And then she shouted into the shaking old\\r\\nman\\'s ears: \"This is a friend of Simon\\'s, papa.\" The old gentleman tried\\r\\nto say \"good day\" to me, and he muttered: \"Oua, oua, oua,\" and waved his\\r\\nhand, and I took a seat, saying: \"You are very kind, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \"So! You have made\\r\\ngrandpapa\\'s acquaintance. He is priceless, is that old man; he is the\\r\\ndelight of the children, and he is so greedy that he almost kills\\r\\nhimself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were\\r\\nallowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He likes\\r\\nall the sweets as if they were so many girls. You have never seen\\r\\nanything funnier; you will see it presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was then shown to my room to change my dress for dinner, and hearing\\r\\na great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all\\r\\nthe children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy windows looked out onto a plain, bare, interminable plain, an ocean\\r\\nof grass, of wheat, and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising\\r\\nground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be\\r\\nleading in that house.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and so I went downstairs. Madame Radevin\\r\\ntook my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we went into the dining-room. A\\r\\nfootman wheeled in the old man\\'s armchair, who gave a greedy and curious\\r\\nlook at the dessert, as he with difficulty turned his shaking head from\\r\\none dish to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \"You will be amused,\" he said; and all the\\r\\nchildren understood that I was going to be indulged with the sight of\\r\\ntheir greedy grandfather, and they began to laugh accordingly, while\\r\\ntheir mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making\\r\\na speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \"This evening\\r\\nthere is sweet rice cream,\" and the wrinkled face of the grandfather\\r\\nbrightened, and he trembled more violently all over, showing that he had\\r\\nunderstood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look!\" Simon whispered. The grandfather did not like the soup, and\\r\\nhe refused to eat it; but he was made to, on account of his health, and\\r\\nthe footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew\\r\\nenergetically, so as not to swallow the soup, which was thus scattered\\r\\nlike a stream of water onto the table and over his neighbors. The\\r\\nchildren shook with delight at the spectacle, while their father, who\\r\\nwas also amused, said: \"Is not the old man funny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole meal, they were all taken up solely with him. He\\r\\ndevoured the dishes which were put on the table, with his eyes, and he\\r\\ntried to seize them and pull them to himself with his trembling hands.\\r\\nThey put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his\\r\\ntrembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of\\r\\nhis eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he\\r\\nslobbered onto his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering\\r\\ninarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this\\r\\nhorrible and grotesque scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they put a tiny morsel onto his plate, which he ate with feverish\\r\\ngluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when\\r\\nthe rice-cream was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with\\r\\ngreediness, and Gontran called out to him: \"You have eaten too much\\r\\nalready; you will have no more.\" And they pretended not to give him any.\\r\\nThen he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever,\\r\\nwhile all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his\\r\\nhelping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful of the\\r\\npudding, he made a comical and greedy noise in his throat, and a\\r\\nmovement with his neck like ducks do when they swallow too large a\\r\\nmorsel, and then, when he had done, he began to stamp his feet, so as to\\r\\nget more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and I\\r\\ninterposed on his behalf: \"Please, will you not give him a little more\\r\\nrice?\" But Simon replied: \"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat\\r\\ntoo much, it might harm him, at his age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI held my tongue, and thought over these words. Oh! ethics! Oh! logic!\\r\\nOh! wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining\\r\\npleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with\\r\\nit, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his\\r\\nlife, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a\\r\\nhundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the\\r\\nspectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He\\r\\nhad one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last\\r\\nsolace constantly, until he died?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I\\r\\nwas low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! I sat at my window, but I heard\\r\\nnothing but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the\\r\\ndistance. No doubt the bird was singing thus in a low voice during the\\r\\nnight, and to lull his mate, who was sleeping on her eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I thought of my poor friend\\'s five children, and pictured him to\\r\\nmyself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJOSEPH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both of them drunk, quite drunk, little Baroness Andrée de la\\r\\nFraisières and little Countess Noemi de Gardens. They had been dining\\r\\nalone together, in the large room which faced the sea. The soft breeze\\r\\nof a summer evening blew in at the open window, soft and fresh at the\\r\\nsame time, a breeze that smelt of the sea. The two young women, extended\\r\\nin their lounging chairs, sipped their Chartreuse from time to time, as\\r\\nthey smoked their cigarettes, and they were talking most confidentially,\\r\\ntelling each other details which nothing but this charming intoxication\\r\\ncould have induced their pretty lips to utter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir husbands had returned to Paris that afternoon, and had left them\\r\\nalone on that little deserted beach, which they had chosen so as to\\r\\navoid those gallant marauders who are constantly met with in fashionable\\r\\nwatering places. As they were absent for five days in the week, they\\r\\nobjected to country excursions, luncheons on the grass, swimming lessons\\r\\nand those sudden familiarities which spring up in the idle life of\\r\\nwatering places. Dieppe, Etratat, Trouville seemed to them to be places\\r\\nto be avoided, and they had rented a house which had been built and\\r\\nabandoned by an eccentric individual in the valley of Roqueville, near\\r\\nFécamp, and there they buried their wives for the whole summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were drunk. Not knowing what to hit upon to amuse themselves, the\\r\\nlittle Baroness had suggested a good dinner and champagne. To begin\\r\\nwith, they had found great amusement in cooking this dinner themselves,\\r\\nand then they had eaten it merrily, and had drunk freely, in order to\\r\\nallay the thirst which the heat of the fire had excited. Now they were\\r\\nchatting and talking nonsense, while gently gargling their throats with\\r\\nChartreuse. In fact they did not in the least know any longer what they\\r\\nwere saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess, with her legs in the air on the back of a chair, was\\r\\nfurther gone than her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To complete an evening like this,\" she said, \"we ought to have a lover\\r\\napiece. If I had foreseen this some time ago, I would have sent for a\\r\\ncouple from Paris, and I would have let you have one....\" \"I can always\\r\\nfind one,\" the other replied; \"I could have one this very evening, if I\\r\\nwished.\" \"What nonsense! At Roqueville, my dear? It would have to be\\r\\nsome peasant, then.\" \"No, not altogether.\" \"Well, tell me all about it.\"\\r\\n\"What do you want me to tell you?\" \"About your lover.\" \"My dear, I do\\r\\nnot want to live without being loved, for I should fancy I was dead if I\\r\\nwere not loved.\" \"So should I.\" \"Is not that so?\" \"Yes. Men cannot\\r\\nunderstand it! And especially our husbands!\" \"No, not in the least. How\\r\\ncan you expect it to be different? The love which we want is made up of\\r\\nbeing spoilt, of gallantries and of pretty words and actions. That is\\r\\nthe nourishment of our hearts; it is indispensable to our life,\\r\\nindispensable, indispensable....\" \"Indispensable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must feel that somebody is thinking of me, always, everywhere. When I\\r\\ngo to sleep and when I wake up, I must know that somebody loves me\\r\\nsomewhere, that I am being dreamt of, longed for. Without that, I should\\r\\nbe wretched, wretched! Oh! yes, unhappy enough to do nothing but cry.\"\\r\\n\"I am just the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember that anything else is impossible. When a husband has\\r\\nbeen nice for six months, or a year, or two years, he necessarily\\r\\nbecomes a brute, yes, a regular brute.... He does not put himself out\\r\\nfor anything, but shows himself just as he is, and makes a scene on the\\r\\nslightest provocation, or without any provocation whatever. One cannot\\r\\nlove a man with whom one lives constantly.\" \"That is quite true.\" \"Isn\\'t\\r\\nit?... What was I saying? I cannot the least remember?\" \"You were saying\\r\\nthat all husbands are brutes!\" \"Yes, brutes ... all of them.\" \"That is\\r\\nquite true.\" \"And then?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What was I saying just\\r\\nthen?\" \"I don\\'t know because you did not say it!\" \"But I had something\\r\\nto tell you.\" \"Oh! yes, that is true; well?...\" \"Oh! I have got it....\"\\r\\n\"Well, I am listening.\" \"I was telling you that I can find lovers\\r\\neverywhere.\" \"How do you manage it?\" \"Like this. Now follow me\\r\\ncarefully. When I get to some fresh place, I take notes and make my\\r\\nchoice.\" \"You make your choice?\" \"Yes, of course I do. First of all, I\\r\\ntake notes. I ask questions. Above all, a man must be discreet, rich and\\r\\ngenerous; is not that so?\" \"It is quite true!\" \"And then he must please\\r\\nme, as a man.\" \"Of course.\" \"Then I bait the hook for him.\" \"You bait\\r\\nthe hook?\" \"Yes, just as one does to catch fish. Have you never fished\\r\\nwith a hook and line?\" \"No, never.\" \"You are wrong; It is very amusing,\\r\\nand besides that, it is instructive. Well then, I bait the hook....\"\\r\\n\"How do you do it?\" \"How stupid you are. Does not one catch the man one\\r\\nwants to catch, without their having any choice? And they really think\\r\\nthat they choose ... the fools ... but it is we who choose ...\\r\\nalways.... Just think, when one is not ugly, nor stupid, as is the case\\r\\nwith us, all men aspire to us, all ... without exception. We look them\\r\\nover from morning till night, and when we have selected one, we fish for\\r\\nhim....\" \"But that does not tell me how you do it?\" \"How I do it?...\\r\\nWhy, I do nothing; I allow myself to be looked at, that is all.\" \"You\\r\\nallow yourself to be looked at?...\" \"Why yes; that is quite enough. When\\r\\none has allowed oneself to be looked at several times following, a man\\r\\nimmediately thinks you the most lovely, most seductive of women, and\\r\\nthen he begins to make love to you. I give him to understand that he is\\r\\nnot so bad looking, without saying anything to him, of course, and he\\r\\nfalls in love, like a dog. I have him fast, and it lasts a longer or a\\r\\nshorter time, according to his qualities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you catch all whom you please, like that?\" \"Nearly all.\" \"Oh! So\\r\\nthere are some who resist?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Why?\" \"Oh! Why? A man is a\\r\\nJoseph for three reasons. Because he is in love with another woman.\\r\\nBecause he is excessively timid, or because he is ... how shall I say\\r\\nit? ... incapable of carrying out the conquest of a woman to the\\r\\nend....\" \"Oh! my dear!... Do you really believe?...\" \"I am sure of\\r\\nit.... There are many of this latter class, many, many ... many more\\r\\nthan people think. Oh! they look just like everybody else ... they strut\\r\\nlike peacocks.... No, when I said peacocks ... I made a mistake, for\\r\\nthey could not display themselves.\" \"Oh! my dear....\" \"As to the timid,\\r\\nthey are sometimes unspeakably stupid. They are the sort of men, who\\r\\nought not to undress themselves, even when they are going to bed alone,\\r\\nwhen there is a looking-glass in their room. With them, one must be\\r\\nenergetic, make use of looks, and squeeze their hands, and even that is\\r\\nuseless sometimes. They never know how or where to begin. When one\\r\\nfaints in their presence ... as a last resource ... they try to bring\\r\\nyou round ... and if you do not recover your senses immediately ... they\\r\\ngo and get assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those whom I prefer myself, are other women\\'s lovers. I carry them by\\r\\nassault ... at ... at ... at the point of the bayonet, my dear!\" \"That\\r\\nis all very well, but when there are no men, like here, for instance?\"\\r\\n\"I find them!\" \"You find them. But where?\" \"Everywhere. But that reminds\\r\\nme of my story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now listen. Just two years ago, my husband made me pass the summer on\\r\\nhis estate at Bougrolles. There was nothing there ... you know what I\\r\\nmean, nothing, nothing, nothing, whatever! In the neighboring country\\r\\nhouses there were a few disgusting boors, who cared for nothing but\\r\\nshooting, and who lived in country houses which had not even a bathroom,\\r\\nmen who perspire, go to bed covered with perspiration, and whom it would\\r\\nbe impossible to improve, because their principles of life are dirty.\\r\\nNow just guess what I did!\" \"I cannot possibly.\" \"Ha! ha! ha! I had\\r\\njust been reading a number of George Sand\\'s novels which exalt the man\\r\\nof the people, novels in which the workmen are sublime, and all the men\\r\\nof the world are criminals. In addition to this I had seen Ruy Blas the\\r\\nwinter before, and it had struck me very much. Well, one of our farmers\\r\\nhad a son, a good-looking young fellow of two and twenty who had studied\\r\\nfor a priest, but had left the seminary in disgust. Well, I took him as\\r\\nfootman!\" \"Oh!... And then?... What afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then ... then, my dear, I treated him very haughtily, and showed him a\\r\\ngood deal of my person. I did not entice this rustic on, I simply\\r\\ninflamed him!...\" \"Oh! Andrée!\" \"Yes, and I enjoyed the fun very much.\\r\\nPeople say that servants count for nothing! Well he did not count for\\r\\nmuch. I used to ring to give him his orders every morning while my maid\\r\\nwas dressing me, and every evening as well, while she was undressing\\r\\nme.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear he caught fire like a thatched roof. Then, at meals, I used\\r\\ncontinually to talk about cleanliness, about taking care of one\\'s\\r\\nperson, about baths and shower baths, until at the end of a fortnight he\\r\\nbathed in the river morning and night, and used to scent himself enough\\r\\nto poison the whole château. I was even obliged to forbid him to use\\r\\nperfumes, telling him, with furious looks, that men ought never to use\\r\\nscent except Eau de Cologne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, I took it into my head to get together a library suitable to the\\r\\ncountry. I sent for a few hundred moral novels, which I lent to all our\\r\\npeasants, and all my servants. A few books ... a few ... poetical books\\r\\n... such as excite the mind of ... schoolboys and schoolgirls ... had\\r\\nfound their way into my collection ... and I gave them to my footman.\\r\\nThat taught him life ... a funny sort of life.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I grew familiar with him, and used to say thou[18] to him. I had\\r\\ngiven him the name of Joseph. And, my dear, he was in a state ... in a\\r\\nterrible state.... He got as thin as ... as a barn-door cock ... and\\r\\nrolled his eyes like an idiot. I was extremely amused; it was one of the\\r\\nmost delightful summers I ever spent....\" \"And then?...\" \"Then?... Oh!\\r\\nyes.... Well, one day when my husband was away from home, I told him to\\r\\norder the basket carriage and to drive me into the woods. It was warm,\\r\\nvery warm.... There!\" \"Oh Andrée, do tell me all about it.... It is so\\r\\namusing....\" \"Here have a glass of Chartreuse, otherwise I shall empty\\r\\nthe decanter myself. Well, I felt ill, on the road.\" \"How?\" \"You are\\r\\nvery stupid. I told him that I was not feeling well, and that he must\\r\\nlay me on the grass, and when I was lying there, I told him I was\\r\\nchoking, and that he must unlace me. And then, when I was unlaced, I\\r\\nfainted.\" \"Did you go right off?\" \"Oh! dear no, not the least.\" \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I was obliged to remain unconscious for nearly an hour, as he\\r\\ncould find no means of bringing me round. But I was very patient, and\\r\\ndid not open my eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!... And what did you say to him?\" \"I? Nothing at all! How\\r\\nwas I to know anything, as I was unconscious? I thanked him, and told\\r\\nhim to help me into the carriage, and he drove me back to the Château;\\r\\nbut he nearly upset us in turning into the gate!\" \"Oh! Andrée! And is\\r\\nthat all?...\" \"That is all....\" \"You did not faint more than that once?\"\\r\\n\"Only once, of course! I did not want to take such a fellow for my\\r\\nlover.\" \"Did you keep him long after that?\" \"Yes, of course. I have him\\r\\nstill. Why should I have sent him away? I had nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée! And is he in love with you still?\" \"Of course he is.\"\\r\\n\"Where is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness put out her hand to the wall and touched the\\r\\nelectric bell, and the door opened almost immediately, and a tall\\r\\nfootman came in who diffused a scent of Eau de Cologne all round him.\\r\\n\"Joseph,\" she said to him, \"I am afraid I am going to faint; send my\\r\\nlady\\'s maid to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood motionless, like a soldier before his officer, and fixed\\r\\nan ardent look on his mistress, who continued: \"Go quickly, you great\\r\\nidiot, we are not in the wood to-day, and Rosalie will attend to me\\r\\nbetter than you would.\" He turned on his heels and went, and the little\\r\\nBaroness asked nervously: \"But what shall you say to your maid?\" \"I\\r\\nshall tell her what we have been doing! No, I shall merely get her to\\r\\nunlace me; it will relieve my chest, for I can scarcely breathe. I am\\r\\ndrunk ... my dear ... so drunk that I should fall, if I were to get up\\r\\nfrom my chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all the wooden inns in the higher Alps, which are situated in the\\r\\nrocky and bare gorges which intersect the white summits of the\\r\\nmountains, the inn of Schwarenbach stands as a refuge for travelers who\\r\\nare crossing the Gemmi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remains open for six months in the year, and is inhabited by the\\r\\nfamily of Jean Hauser; then, as soon as the snow begins to fall, and\\r\\nfills the valley so as to make the road down to Loëche impassable, the\\r\\nfather and his three sons go away, and leave the house in charge of the\\r\\nold guide, Gaspard Hari, with the young guide, Ulrich Kunzi, and Sam,\\r\\nthe great mountain dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men and the dog remained till the spring in their snowy prison,\\r\\nwith nothing before their eyes except the immense, white slopes of the\\r\\nBalmhorn; they were surrounded by light, glistening summits, and shut\\r\\nup, blocked up and buried by the snow which rose around them, and which\\r\\nenveloped, bound and crushed the little house, which lay piled on the\\r\\nroof, reached to the windows and blocked up the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to\\r\\nLoëche, as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming\\r\\ndangerous. Three mules started first, laden with baggage and led by the\\r\\nthree sons. Then the mother, Jean Hauser and her daughter Louise mounted\\r\\na fourth mule, and set off in their turn, and the father followed them,\\r\\naccompanied by the two men in charge, who were to escort the family as\\r\\nfar as the brow of the descent. First of all they passed round the small\\r\\nlake, which was now frozen over, at the bottom of the mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich stretched in front of the inn, and then they followed the valley,\\r\\nwhich was dominated on all sides by the snow covered summits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ray of sunlight fell into that little white, glistening, frozen\\r\\ndesert, and illuminated it with a cold and dazzling flame; no living\\r\\nthing appeared among this ocean of hills; there was nothing more in this\\r\\nimmeasurable solitude, and no noise disturbed the profound silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees the young guide Ulrich Kunzi, a tall, long legged Swiss, left\\r\\ndaddy Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to catch up to the mule,\\r\\nwhich carried the two women. The younger one looked at him as he\\r\\napproached, and appeared to be calling him, with her sad eyes. She was a\\r\\nyoung, light haired peasant girl, whose milk white cheeks and pale hair\\r\\nlooked as if they had lost their color by their long abode amidst the\\r\\nice. When he had got up with the animal which carried them, he put his\\r\\nhand on the crupper, and relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk\\r\\nto him, and enumerated with the minutest details all that he would have\\r\\nto attend to during the winter. It was the first time that he was going\\r\\nto stop up there, while old Hari had already spent fourteen winters\\r\\namidst the snow, at the inn of Schwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened, without appearing to understand, and looked\\r\\nincessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied: \"Yes, Madame\\r\\nHauser;\" but his thoughts seemed far away, and his calm features\\r\\nremained unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface extended to the\\r\\nbottom of the valley. On the right, the Daubenhorn showed its black\\r\\nrocks, rising up in a peak above the enormous moraines of the Lömmeon\\r\\nglacier, which rose above the Wildstrubel. As they approached the neck\\r\\nof the Gemmi, where the descent to Loëche begins, they suddenly beheld\\r\\nthe immense horizon of the Alps of the Valais, from which the broad,\\r\\ndeep valley of the Rhone separated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance, there was a group of white, unequal flat or pointed\\r\\nmountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the Mischabel with its two\\r\\npeaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn, the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty\\r\\nand formidable pyramid of Mont Cervin, that slayer of men, and the\\r\\nDent-Blanche, that terrible coquette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, beneath them, in a tremendous hole, at the bottom of a terrible\\r\\nabyss, they perceived Loëche, where houses looked as grains of sand\\r\\nwhich had been thrown in that enormous crevice, which finishes and\\r\\ncloses the Gemmi, and which opens, down below, onto the Rhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mule stopped at the edge of the path, which goes turning and\\r\\ntwisting continually, and which comes back fantastically and strangely,\\r\\nalong the side of the mountain, as far as the almost invisible little\\r\\nvillage at its feet. The women jumped into the snow, and the two old men\\r\\njoined them. \"Well,\" father Hauser said, \"good-bye, and keep up your\\r\\nspirits till next year, my friends,\" and old Hari replied: \"Till next\\r\\nyear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey embraced each other, and then Madame Hauser in her turn, offered\\r\\nher cheek, and the girl did the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulrich Kunzi\\'s turn came, he whispered in Louise\\'s ear: \"Do not\\r\\nforget those up yonder,\" and she replied: \"no,\" in such a low voice,\\r\\nthat he guessed what she had said, without hearing it. \"Well, adieu,\"\\r\\nJean Hauser repeated, \"and don\\'t fall ill.\" And going before the two\\r\\nwomen, he commenced the descent, and soon all three disappeared at the\\r\\nfirst turn in the road, while the two men returned to the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked slowly, side by side, without speaking. It was over, and\\r\\nthey would be alone together for four or five months. Then Gaspard Bari\\r\\nbegan to relate his life last winter. He had remained with Michael\\r\\nCanol, who was too old now to stand it; for an accident might happen\\r\\nduring that long solitude. They had not been dull, however; the only\\r\\nthing was to make up one\\'s mind to it from the first, and in the end one\\r\\nwould find plenty of distraction, games and other means of whiling away\\r\\nthe time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in his\\r\\nthoughts he was following those who were descending to the village. They\\r\\nsoon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so\\r\\nsmall did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of\\r\\nsnow, and when they opened the door, Sam, the great curly dog, began to\\r\\nromp round them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, my boy,\" old Gaspard said, \"we have no women now, so we must get\\r\\nour own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes.\" And they both sat down\\r\\non wooden stools, and began to put the bread into the soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning seemed very long to Kunzi. Old Hari smoked and spat\\r\\nonto the hearth, while the young man looked out of the window at the\\r\\nsnow-covered mountain opposite the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon he went out, and going over yesterday\\'s ground again,\\r\\nhe looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the two women;\\r\\nthen when he had reached the neck of the Gemmi, he laid himself down on\\r\\nhis stomach and looked at Loëche.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow,\\r\\nalthough it came quite close to it, but it was stopped short by the pine\\r\\nwoods which protected it. Its low houses looked like paving stones in a\\r\\nlarge meadow, from up there. Hauser\\'s little daughter was there now, in\\r\\none of those gray colored houses. In which? Ulrich Kunzi was too far\\r\\naway to be able to make them out separately. How he would have liked to\\r\\ngo down, while he was yet able!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the Wildstrubel,\\r\\nand the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari was smoking, and\\r\\nwhen he saw his mate come in, he proposed a game of cards to him, and\\r\\nthey sat down opposite each other, on either side of the table. They\\r\\nplayed for a long time, a simple game called _brisque_, and then they\\r\\nhad supper and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following days were like the first, bright and cold, without any\\r\\nmore snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the eagles and\\r\\nother rare birds which ventured onto those frozen heights, while Ulrich\\r\\nreturned regularly to the neck of the Gemmi to look at the village. Then\\r\\nthey played at cards, dice or dominoes, and lost and won a trifle, just\\r\\nto create an interest in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A moving deep\\r\\nand light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly, and was\\r\\nby degrees burying them under a thick, dark coverlet of foam, and that\\r\\nlasted four days and four nights. It was necessary to free the door and\\r\\nthe windows, to dig out a passage and to cut steps to get over this\\r\\nfrozen powder, which a twelve hours frost had made as hard as the\\r\\ngranite of the moraines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived like prisoners, and did not venture outside their abode. They\\r\\nhad divided their duties, which they performed regularly. Ulrich Kunzi\\r\\nundertook the scouring, washing, and everything that belonged to\\r\\ncleanliness. He also chopped up the wood, while Gaspard Hari did the\\r\\ncooking and attended to the fire. Their regular and monotonous work was\\r\\ninterrupted by long games at cards or dice, and they never quarreled,\\r\\nbut were always calm and placid. They were never even impatient or\\r\\nill-humored, nor did they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a\\r\\nstock of patience for their wintering on the top of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and\\r\\noccasionally he killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach, and they reveled in fresh meat. One morning he went out as\\r\\nusual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of frost, and as\\r\\nthe sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to surprise the animals at\\r\\nthe approaches to the Wildstrubel, and Ulrich, being alone, remained in\\r\\nbed until ten o\\'clock. He was of a sleepy nature, but he would not have\\r\\ndared to give way like that to his inclination in the presence of the\\r\\nold guide, who was ever an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with\\r\\nSam, who also spent his days and nights in sleeping in front of the\\r\\nfire; then he felt low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and\\r\\nwas seized by a longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the\\r\\ndesire of an invincible habit, and so he went out to meet his companion,\\r\\nwho was to return at four o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow had leveled the whole deep valley, filled up the _crevasses_,\\r\\nobliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the rocks, so that\\r\\nbetween the high summits there was nothing but an immense, white,\\r\\nregular, dazzling and frozen surface. For three weeks, Ulrich had not\\r\\nbeen to the edge of the precipice, from which he had looked down onto\\r\\nthe village, and he wanted to go there before climbing the slopes which\\r\\nled to Wildstrubel. Loëche was now also covered by the snow, and the\\r\\nhouses could scarcely be distinguished, covered as they were by that\\r\\nwhite cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to the right, he reached the Lämmern glacier. He went along\\r\\nwith a mountaineer\\'s long strides, striking the snow, which was as hard\\r\\nas a rock, with his iron-shod stick, and with his piercing eyes, he\\r\\nlooked for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that\\r\\nenormous, white expanse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached the end of the glacier he stopped and asked himself\\r\\nwhether the old man had taken that road, and then he began to walk along\\r\\nthe moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The day was declining; the\\r\\nsnow was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry, frozen wind blew in rough\\r\\ngusts over its crystal surface. Ulrich uttered a long, shrill, vibrating\\r\\ncall; his voice sped through the deathlike silence in which the\\r\\nmountains were sleeping; it reached the distance, over profound and\\r\\nmotionless waves of glacial foam, like the cry of a bird over the waves\\r\\nof the sea; then it died away and nothing answered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set to walk again. The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain tops,\\r\\nwhich were still purple with the reflection from the sky; but the depths\\r\\nof the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt\\r\\nfrightened. It seemed to him as if the silence, the cold, the solitude,\\r\\nthe winter death of these mountains were taking possession of him, were\\r\\ngoing to stop and to freeze his blood, to make his limbs grow stiff, and\\r\\nto turn him into a motionless and frozen object; and he set off running,\\r\\nfleeing towards his dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have\\r\\nreturned during his absence. He had taken another road; he would, no\\r\\ndoubt, be sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe soon came in sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it. Ulrich\\r\\nwalked faster and opened the door; Sam ran up to him to greet him, but\\r\\nGaspard Hari had not returned. Kunzi, in his alarm, turned round\\r\\nsuddenly, as if he had expected to find his comrade hidden in a corner.\\r\\nThen he re-lighted the fire and made the soup; hoping every moment to\\r\\nsee the old man come in. From time to time he went out, to see if he\\r\\nwere not coming in. It was quite night now, that wan night of the\\r\\nmountains, a livid night, with the crescent moon, yellow and dim and\\r\\njust disappearing behind the mountain tops, lit up on the edge of the\\r\\nhorizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and his feet,\\r\\nwhile he pictured to himself every possible accident. Gaspard might have\\r\\nbroken a leg, have fallen into a crevasse, taken a false step and\\r\\ndislocated his ankle. And perhaps he was lying on the snow, overcome and\\r\\nstiff with the cold, in agony of mind, lost and perhaps shouting for\\r\\nhelp, calling with all his might, in the silence of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut where? The mountain was so vast, so rugged, so dangerous in places,\\r\\nespecially at that time of the year, that it would have required ten or\\r\\ntwenty guides to walk for a week in all directions, to find a man in\\r\\nthat immense space. Ulrich Kunzi, however, made up his mind to set out\\r\\nwith Sam, if Gaspard did not return by one in the morning; and he made\\r\\nhis preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel climbing\\r\\nirons, tied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist and looked to see\\r\\nthat his iron-shod stick and his axe, which served to cut steps in the\\r\\nice, were in order. Then he waited. The fire was burning on the hearth\\r\\nand the great dog was snoring in front of it, and the clock was ticking\\r\\nas regularly as a heart beating, in its case of resounding wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waited, with his ears on the alert for distant sounds, and he\\r\\nshivered when the wind blew against the roof and the walls. It struck\\r\\ntwelve, and he trembled. Then, as he felt frightened and shuddering, he\\r\\nput some water on the fire, so that he might have some hot coffee before\\r\\nstarting, and when the clock struck one he got up, woke Sam, opened the\\r\\ndoor and went off in the direction of the Wildstrubel. For five hours he\\r\\nmounted, scaling the rocks by means of his climbing irons, cutting into\\r\\nthe ice, advancing continually and occasionally hauling up the dog, who\\r\\nremained below at the foot of some slope that was too steep for him, by\\r\\nmeans of the rope. It was about six o\\'clock when he reached one of the\\r\\nsummits to which old Gaspard often came after chamois, and he waited\\r\\ntill it should be daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was growing pale over head, and suddenly a strange light,\\r\\nspringing, nobody could tell whence, illuminated the immense ocean of\\r\\npale mountain summits, which stretched for a thousand leagues around\\r\\nhim. One might have said that this vague brightness arose from the snow\\r\\nitself, in order to spread itself into space. By degrees the highest,\\r\\ndistant summits assumed a delicate, fleshlike rose color, and the red\\r\\nsun appeared behind the ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi set off again, walking like a hunter, bent and looking for\\r\\nany traces, and saying to his dog: \"Seek, old fellow, seek!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely, and\\r\\nfrom time to time shouting, uttering a loud, prolonged cry, which soon\\r\\ndied away in that silent vastness. Then, he put his ear to the ground,\\r\\nto listen; he thought he could distinguish a voice, and so he began to\\r\\nrun, and shouted again, but he heard nothing more and sat down, worn out\\r\\nand in despair. Towards midday, he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as\\r\\ntired as himself, something to eat also, and then he recommenced his\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came he was still walking, and he had walked more than\\r\\nthirty miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return home,\\r\\nand too tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a hole in the\\r\\nsnow and crouched in it with his dog, under a blanket which he had\\r\\nbrought with him. And the man and the dog lay side by side, warming\\r\\nthemselves one against the other, but frozen to the marrow,\\r\\nnevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept, his mind haunted by visions and his\\r\\nlimbs shaking with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron bars,\\r\\nand his spirits so low that he was ready to cry with grief, while his\\r\\nheart was beating so that he almost fell with excitement, when he\\r\\nthought he heard a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he imagined that he also was going to die of cold in the midst\\r\\nof this vast solitude, and the terror of such a death roused his\\r\\nenergies and gave him renewed vigor. He was descending towards the inn,\\r\\nfalling down and getting up again, and followed at a distance by Sam,\\r\\nwho was limping on three legs, and they did not reach Schwarenbach until\\r\\nfour o\\'clock in the afternoon. The house was empty, and the young man\\r\\nmade a fire, had something to eat and went to sleep, so worn out that he\\r\\ndid not think of anything more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slept for a long time, for a very long time, an unconquerable sleep.\\r\\nBut suddenly a voice, a cry, a name: \"Ulrich,\" aroused him from his\\r\\nprofound torpor and made him sit up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was it\\r\\none of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds?\\r\\nNo, he heard it still, that reverberating cry,--which had entered at his\\r\\nears and remained in his flesh,--to the tips of his sinewy fingers.\\r\\nCertainly, somebody had cried out, and called: \"Ulrich!\" There was\\r\\nsomebody there, near the house, there could be no doubt of that, and he\\r\\nopened the door and shouted: \"Is it you, Gaspard?\" with all the strength\\r\\nof his lungs. But there was no reply, no murmur, no groan, nothing. It\\r\\nwas quite dark, and the snow looked wan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind had risen, that icy wind that cracks the rocks, and leaves\\r\\nnothing alive on those deserted heights, and it came in sudden gusts,\\r\\nwhich were more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the\\r\\ndesert, and again Ulrich shouted: \"Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard!\" And then\\r\\nhe waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain! Then he shook\\r\\nwith terror and with a bound he was inside the inn, when he shut and\\r\\nbolted the door, and then he fell into a chair, trembling all over, for\\r\\nhe felt certain that his comrade had called him, at the moment he was\\r\\nexpiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sure of that, as sure as one is of being alive, or of eating a\\r\\npiece of bread. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two days and three\\r\\nnights somewhere, in some hole, in one of those deep, untrodden ravines\\r\\nwhose whiteness is more sinister than subterranean darkness. He had been\\r\\ndying for two days and three nights and he had just then died, thinking\\r\\nof his comrade. His soul, almost before it was released, had taken its\\r\\nflight to the inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by\\r\\nthat terrible and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead have,\\r\\nto haunt the living. That voiceless soul had cried to the wornout soul\\r\\nof the sleeper; it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach, or\\r\\nits curse on the man who had not searched carefully enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the wall,\\r\\nbehind the door which he had just fastened. It was wandering about, like\\r\\na night bird, which lightly touches a lighted window with his wings,\\r\\nand the terrified young man was ready to scream with horror. He wanted\\r\\nto run away, but did not dare to go out; he did not dare, and he should\\r\\nnever dare to do it in the future, for that phantom would remain there\\r\\nday and night, round the inn, as long as the old man\\'s body was not\\r\\nrecovered and had not been deposited in the consecrated earth of a\\r\\nchurchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight, Kunzi recovered some of his courage at the return\\r\\nof the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some food, and\\r\\nthen remained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart as he thought of\\r\\nthe old man lying on the snow, and then, as soon as night once more\\r\\ncovered the mountains, new terrors assailed him. He now walked up and\\r\\ndown the dark kitchen, which was scarcely lighted by the flame of one\\r\\ncandle, and he walked from one end of it to the other with great\\r\\nstrides, listening, listening whether the terrible cry of the other\\r\\nnight would again break the dreary silence outside. He felt himself\\r\\nalone, unhappy man, as no man had ever been alone before! He was alone\\r\\nin this immense desert of snow, alone five thousand feet above the\\r\\ninhabited earth, above human habitations, above that stirring, noisy,\\r\\npalpitating life, alone under an icy sky! A mad longing impelled him to\\r\\nrun away, no matter where, to get down to Loëche by flinging himself\\r\\nover the precipice; but he did not even dare to open the door, as he\\r\\nfelt sure that the other, the dead man, would bar his road, so that he\\r\\nmight not be obliged to remain up there alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards midnight, tired with walking, wornout by grief and fear, he at\\r\\nlast fell into a doze in his chair, for he was as afraid of his bed, as\\r\\none is of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the other\\r\\nevening pierced his ears, and it was so shrill that Ulrich stretched\\r\\nout his arms to repulse the ghost, and he fell onto his back with his\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl, like frightened dogs\\r\\ndo howl, and he walked all about the house, trying to find out where the\\r\\ndanger came from; but when he got to the door, he sniffed beneath it,\\r\\nsmelling vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail stiff, while\\r\\nhe growled angrily. Kunzi, who was terrified, jumped up, and holding his\\r\\nchair by one leg, he cried: \"Don\\'t come in, don\\'t come in, or I shall\\r\\nkill you.\" And the dog, excited by this threat, barked angrily at that\\r\\ninvisible enemy who defied his master\\'s voice. By degrees, however, he\\r\\nquieted down and came back and stretched himself in front of the fire,\\r\\nbut he was uneasy, and kept his head up, and growled between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with terror,\\r\\nhe went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard, and he drank\\r\\noff several glasses, one after another, at a gulp. His ideas became\\r\\nvague, his courage revived, and a feverish glow ran through his veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate scarcely anything the next day, and limited himself to alcohol,\\r\\nand so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As soon as he\\r\\nthought of Gaspard Hari, he began to drink again, and went on drinking\\r\\nuntil he fell onto the ground, overcome by intoxication. And there he\\r\\nremained on his face, dead drunk, his limbs benumbed, and snoring, with\\r\\nhis face to the ground. But scarcely had he digested the maddening and\\r\\nburning liquor, than the same cry, \"Ulrich,\" woke him like a bullet\\r\\npiercing his brain, and he got up, still staggering, stretching out his\\r\\nhands to save himself from falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And\\r\\nthe dog, who appeared to be going mad, like his master, rushed to the\\r\\ndoor, scratched it with his claws, and gnawed it with his long white\\r\\nteeth, while the young man, with his neck thrown back, and his head in\\r\\nthe air, drank the brandy in draughts, as if it had been cold water, so\\r\\nthat it might by and by send his thoughts, his frantic terror and his\\r\\nmemory, to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits, but his\\r\\ncontinual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke more furiously\\r\\nthan ever, as soon as it was impossible for him to calm it. His fixed\\r\\nidea then, which had been intensified by a month of drunkenness, and\\r\\nwhich was continually increasing in his absolute solitude, penetrated\\r\\nhim like a gimlet. He now walked about his house like a wild beast in\\r\\nits cage, putting his ear to the door to listen if the other were there,\\r\\nand defying him through the wall. Then, as soon as he dozed, overcome by\\r\\nfatigue, he heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last one night, like cowards do when driven to extremities, he sprang\\r\\nto the door and opened it, to see who was calling him, and to force him\\r\\nto keep quiet, but such a gust of cold wind blew into his face that it\\r\\nchilled him to the bone, and he closed and bolted the door again\\r\\nimmediately, without noticing that Sam had rushed out. Then, as he was\\r\\nshivering with cold, he threw some wood on the fire, and sat down in\\r\\nfront of it to warm himself, but suddenly he started, for somebody was\\r\\nscratching at the wall, and crying. In desperation he called out: \"Go\\r\\naway!\" but was answered by another long, sorrowful wail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, all his remaining senses forsook him, from sheer fright. He\\r\\nrepeated: \"Go away!\" and turned round to try to find some corner in\\r\\nwhich to hide, while the other person went round the house, still crying\\r\\nand rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak sideboard, which\\r\\nwas full of plates and dishes and of provisions, and lifting it up with\\r\\nsuperhuman strength, he dragged it to the door, so as to form a\\r\\nbarricade. Then piling up all the rest of the furniture, the mattresses,\\r\\npalliasses and chairs, he stopped up the windows like one does when\\r\\nassailed by an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful groans, to\\r\\nwhich the young man replied by similar groans, and thus days and nights\\r\\npassed, without their ceasing to howl at each other. The one was\\r\\ncontinually walking round the house, and scraped the walls with his\\r\\nnails so vigorously that it seemed as if he wished to destroy them,\\r\\nwhile the other, inside, followed all his movements, stooping down, and\\r\\nholding his ear to the walls, and replying to all his appeals with\\r\\nterrible cries. One evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he\\r\\nsat down, so overcome by fatigue, that he went to sleep immediately, and\\r\\nawoke in the morning without a thought, without any recollection of what\\r\\nhad happened, just as if his head had been emptied during his heavy\\r\\nsleep, but he felt hungry, and he ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter was over, and the Gemmi pass was practicable again, so the\\r\\nHauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as they had\\r\\nreached the top of the ascent, the women mounted their mule, and spoke\\r\\nabout the two men who they would meet again shortly. They were, indeed,\\r\\nrather surprised that neither of them had come down a few days before,\\r\\nas soon as the road became usable, in order to tell them all about their\\r\\nlong winter sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered\\r\\nwith snow, like a quilt. The door and the window were closed, but a\\r\\nlittle smoke was coming out of the chimney, which reassured old Hauser;\\r\\non going up to the door, however, he saw the skeleton of an animal which\\r\\nhad been torn to pieces by the eagles, a large skeleton lying on its\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all looked closely at it, and the mother said: \"That must be Sam,\"\\r\\nand then she shouted: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" A cry from the interior of the\\r\\nhouse answered her, and a sharp cry, that one might have thought some\\r\\nanimal had uttered it. Old Hauser repeated: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" and they\\r\\nheard another cry, similar to the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open the door,\\r\\nbut it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall they took a beam\\r\\nto serve as a battering-ram, and hurled it against the door with all\\r\\ntheir might. The wood gave way, and the boards flew into splinters; then\\r\\nthe house was shaken by a loud voice, and inside, behind the sideboard,\\r\\nwhich was overturned, they saw a man standing upright, with his hair\\r\\nfalling onto his shoulders, and a beard descending to his breast, with\\r\\nshining eyes and nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize\\r\\nhim, but Louise Hauser exclaimed: \"It is Ulrich, mother.\" And her mother\\r\\ndeclared that it was Ulrich, although his hair was white.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe allowed them to go up to him, and to touch him, but he did not reply\\r\\nto any of their questions, and they were obliged to take him to Loëche,\\r\\nwhere the doctors found that he was mad, and nobody ever knew what had\\r\\nbecome of his companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which the\\r\\nmedical men attributed to the cold air of the mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUGLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, at this blessed epoch of Equality of mediocrity, of\\r\\nrectangular abomination, as Edgar Poe says, at this delightful period,\\r\\nwhen everybody dreams of resembling everybody else, so that it has\\r\\nbecome impossible to tell the President of the Republic from a waiter;\\r\\nin these days, which are the forerunners of that promising, blissful\\r\\nday, when everything in this world will be of a dully, neuter\\r\\nuniformity, certainly at such an epoch, one has the right, or rather it\\r\\nis one\\'s duty, to be ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, assuredly, exercised that right with the most cruel vigor,\\r\\nand he fulfilled that duty with the fiercest heroism, and to make\\r\\nmatters worse, the mysterious irony of fate had caused him to be born\\r\\nwith the name of Lebeau, while an ingenious godfather, the unconscious\\r\\naccomplice of the pranks of destiny, had given him the Christian name of\\r\\nAntinous.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven among our contemporaries, who were already on the high road to the\\r\\ncoming ideal of universal ugliness, Antinous Lebeau was remarkable for\\r\\nhis ugliness, and one might have said that he positively threw zeal, too\\r\\nmuch zeal, into the matter, though he was not hideous like Mirabeau, who\\r\\nmade the people exclaim: \"Oh! the beautiful monster!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! No. He was without any beauty, even without the beauty of\\r\\nugliness. He was ugly, that was all; nothing more nor less; in short, he\\r\\nwas uglily ugly. He was not humpbacked, nor knock-kneed, nor\\r\\npot-bellied; his legs were not like a pair of tongs, and his arms were\\r\\nneither too long nor too short, and yet, there was an utter lack of\\r\\nuniformity about him, not only in painters\\' eyes, but also in\\r\\neverybody\\'s, for nobody could meet him in the street without turning to\\r\\nlook after him, and thinking: \"Good heavens! What an object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hair was of no particular color; a light chestnut, mixed with\\r\\nyellow. There was not much of it, but still, he was not absolutely bald,\\r\\nbut quite bald enough to allow his butter-colored pate to show.\\r\\nButter-colored? Hardly! The color of margarine would be more applicable,\\r\\nand such pale margarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face was also like margarine, but of adulterated margarine,\\r\\ncertainly. By the side of it, his _cranium_, the color of unadulterated\\r\\nmargarine, looked almost like butter, by comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was very little to say about his mouth! Less than little; the sum\\r\\ntotal was--nothing. It was a chimerical mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut take it, that I have said nothing about him, and let us replace this\\r\\nvain description by the useful formula: _Impossible to describe him_.\\r\\nBut you must not forget that Antinous Lebeau was ugly, that the fact\\r\\nimpressed everybody as soon as they saw him, and that nobody remembered\\r\\never having seen an uglier person; and let us add, that as the climax of\\r\\nhis misfortune, he thought so himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this you will see that he was not a fool, but, then, he was not\\r\\nill-natured, either; but, of course, he was unhappy. An unhappy man\\r\\nthinks only of his wretchedness, and people take his night cap for a\\r\\nfool\\'s cap, while, on the other hand, goodness is only esteemed when it\\r\\nis cheerful. Consequently, Antinous Lebeau passed for a fool, and an\\r\\nill-tempered fool, and he was not even pitied because he was so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had only one pleasure in life, and that was to go and roam about the\\r\\ndarkest streets on dark nights, and to hear the street-walkers say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come home with me, you handsome, dark man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, alas! a furtive pleasure, and he knew that it was not true. For,\\r\\noccasionally, when the woman was old or drunk and he profited by the\\r\\ninvitation, as soon as the candle was lighted in the garret, they no\\r\\nlonger murmured the fallacious: _handsome, dark man_; and when they saw\\r\\nhim, the old women grew still older, and the drunken women got sober.\\r\\nAnd more than one, although hardened against disgust, and ready for all\\r\\nrisks, said to him, and in spite of his liberal payment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My little man, you are most confoundedly ugly, I must say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, however, he renounced even that lamentable pleasure, when he\\r\\nheard the still more lamentable words which a wretched woman could not\\r\\nhelp uttering when he went home with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he must have been very hungry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! He was hungry, unhappy man; hungry for love, for something that\\r\\nshould resemble love, were it ever so little; he longed not to live like\\r\\na pariah any more, not to be exiled and proscribed in his ugliness. And\\r\\nthe ugliest, the most repugnant woman would have appeared beautiful to\\r\\nhim, if she would only have not consented to think him ugly, or, at any\\r\\nrate, not to tell him so, and not to let him see that she felt horror\\r\\nat him on that account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequence was, that, when he one day met a poor, blear-eyed\\r\\ncreature, with her face covered with scabs, and bearing evident signs of\\r\\nalcoholism, with a driveling mouth, and ragged and filthy petticoats, to\\r\\nwhom he gave liberal alms, for which she kissed his hand, he took her\\r\\nhome with him, had her clean dressed and taken care of, made her his\\r\\nservant, and then his housekeeper. Next he raised her to the rank of his\\r\\nmistress, and, finally, of course, he married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was almost as ugly as he was! She really was; but only, almost.\\r\\nAlmost, but certainly not quite; for she was hideous, and her\\r\\nhideousness had its charm and its beauty, no doubt; that something by\\r\\nwhich a woman can attract a man. And she had proved that by deceiving\\r\\nhim, and she let him see it better still, by seducing another man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat other was actually uglier than he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was certainly uglier, that collection of every physical and moral\\r\\nugliness, that companion of beggars whom she had picked up among her\\r\\nformer vagrant associates, that jailbird, that dealer in little girls,\\r\\nthat vagabond covered with filth, with legs like a toad\\'s, with a mouth\\r\\nlike a lamprey, and a death\\'s head, in which the nose had been replaced\\r\\nby two holes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have wronged me with a wretch like that,\" the poor cuckold\\r\\nsaid. \"And in my own house! and in such a manner that I might catch you\\r\\nin the very act! And why, why, you wretch? Why, seeing that he is uglier\\r\\nthan I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no,\" she exclaimed. \"You may say what you like, but do not say that\\r\\nhe is uglier than you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the unhappy man stood there, vanquished and overcome by her last\\r\\nwords, which she uttered without understanding all the horror which he\\r\\nwould feel at them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you see, he has his own particular ugliness, while you are\\r\\nmerely ugly like everybody else is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Literally, \"The bird flies\"--a pun on the verb voler, which means\\r\\nboth \"to fly\" and \"to steal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Nickname for Napoleon III.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] _Jevôdre voir vô comment vô faites le painture?

But then things are as our eyes see them and as our minds make\\r\\nthem; and it is thus of primary importance for the critic to distinguish\\r\\nthe precise qualities of the eyes and minds which make the world into\\r\\nimaginative literature. Reality may be so definite and so false, just as\\r\\nit may be so fantastic and so true; and, among work which we can\\r\\napprehend as dealing justly with reality, there may be quite as much\\r\\ndifference in all that constitutes outward form and likeness as there is\\r\\nbetween a Dutch interior by Peter van der Hooch, the portrait of a king\\r\\nby Velasquez, and the image of a woman smiling by Leonardo da Vinci. The\\r\\nsoul, for instance, is at heart as real as the body; but, as we can hear\\r\\nit only through the body speaking, and see it only through bodily eyes,\\r\\nand measure it, often enough, only in the insignificant moment of its\\r\\naction, it may come to seem to us, at all events less realizable; and\\r\\nthus it is that we speak of those who have vividly painted exterior\\r\\nthings as realists. Properly speaking, Maupassant is no more a realist\\r\\nthan Maeterlinck. He paints a kind of reality which it is easier for us\\r\\nto recognize; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery artist has his own vision of the world. Maupassant\\'s vision was of\\r\\nsolid superficies, of texture which his hands could touch, of actions\\r\\nwhich his mind could comprehend from the mere sight of its incidents.\\r\\nHe saw the world as the Dutch painters saw it, and he was as great a\\r\\nmaster of form, of rich and sober color, of the imitation of the outward\\r\\ngestures of life, and of the fashion of external things. He had the same\\r\\nview of humanity, and shows us, with the same indifference, the same\\r\\nviolent ferment of life--the life of full-blooded people who have to\\r\\nelbow their way through the world. His sense of desire, of greed, of all\\r\\nthe baser passions, was profound: he had the terrible logic of\\r\\nanimalism. Love-making, drunkenness, cheating, quarreling, the mere\\r\\nidleness of sitting drowsily in a chair, the gross life of the farmyard\\r\\nand the fields, civic dissensions, the sordid provincial dance of the\\r\\nseven deadly sins, he saw in the same direct, unilluminating way as the\\r\\nDutch painters; finding, indeed, no beauty in any of these things, but\\r\\ngetting his beauty in the deft arrangement of them, in the mere act of\\r\\nplacing them in a picture. The world existed for him as something\\r\\nformless which could be cut up into little pictures. He saw no farther\\r\\nthan the lines of his frame. The interest of the thing began inside that\\r\\nframe, and what remained outside was merely material.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story of Maupassant, more than almost anything in the world, gives you\\r\\nthe impression of manual dexterity. It is adequately thought out, but it\\r\\ndoes not impress you by its thought; it is clearly seen, but it does not\\r\\nimpress you specially by the fidelity of its detail; it has just enough\\r\\nof ordinary human feeling for the limits it has imposed on itself. What\\r\\nimpresses you is the extreme ingenuity of its handling; the way in which\\r\\nthis juggler keeps his billiard-balls harmoniously rising and falling in\\r\\nthe air. Often, indeed, you cannot help noticing the conscious smile\\r\\nwhich precedes the trick, and the confident bow which concludes it. He\\r\\ndoes not let you into the secret of the trick, but he prevents you from\\r\\nignoring that it is after all, only a trick which you have been\\r\\nwatching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a philosophy of one kind or another behind the work of every\\r\\nartist. Maupassant\\'s was a simple one, sufficient for his needs as he\\r\\nunderstood them, though perhaps really consequent upon his artistic\\r\\nmethods, rather than at the root of them. It was the philosophy of\\r\\ncynicism: the most effectual means of limiting one\\'s outlook, of\\r\\nconcentrating all one\\'s energies on the task in hand. Maupassant wrote\\r\\nfor men of the world, and men of the world are content with the wisdom\\r\\nof their counting-houses. The man of the world is perfectly willing to\\r\\nadmit that he is no better than you, because he takes it for granted\\r\\nthat you will admit yourself to be no better than he. It is a way of\\r\\navoiding comparison. To Maupassant this cynical point of view was\\r\\ninvaluable for his purpose. He wanted to tell stories just for the\\r\\npleasure of telling them; he wanted to concern himself with his story\\r\\nsimply as a story; incidents interested him, not ideas, nor even\\r\\ncharacters, and he wanted every incident to be immediately effective.\\r\\nNow cynicism, in France, supplies a sufficient basis for all these\\r\\nrequirements; it is the equivalent, for popular purposes, of that appeal\\r\\nto the average which in England is sentimentality. Compare, for\\r\\ninstance, the admirable story \"Boule de Suif,\" perhaps the best story\\r\\nwhich Maupassant ever wrote, with a story of somewhat similar\\r\\nmotive--Bret Harte\\'s \"Outcasts of Poker Flat.\" Both stories are\\r\\npathetic; but the pathos of the American (who had formed himself upon\\r\\nDickens, and in the English tradition) becomes sentimental, and gets its\\r\\nsuccess by being sentimental; while the pathos of the Frenchman (who has\\r\\nformed himself on Flaubert, and on French lines) gets its success\\r\\nprecisely by being cynical.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the particular variety of Maupassant\\'s cynicism was just that\\r\\nvariation of the artistic idea upon the temperament which puts the best\\r\\nfinish upon work necessarily so limited, obliged to be so clenching, as\\r\\nthe short story. Flaubert\\'s gigantic dissatisfaction with life, his\\r\\nreally philosophic sense of its vanity, would have overweighted a writer\\r\\nso thoroughly equipped for his work as the writer of \"Boule de Suif\" and\\r\\n\"La Maison Tellier.\" Maupassant had no time, he allowed himself no\\r\\nspace, to reason about life; the need was upon him to tell story after\\r\\nstory, each with its crisis, its thrill, its summing up of a single\\r\\nexistence or a single action. The sharp, telling thrust that his\\r\\nconception of art demanded could be given only by a very specious, not\\r\\nvery profound, very forthright, kind of cynicism, like the half kindly,\\r\\nhalf contemptuous laugh of the man who tells a good story at the club.\\r\\nFor him it was the point of the epigram.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaupassant was the man of his period, and his period was that of\\r\\nNaturalism. In \"Les Soirees de Medan,\" the volume in which \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\" appeared, there is another story called \"Sac au Dos,\" in which\\r\\nanother novelist made his appearance among the five who \"publicly\\r\\naffirmed their literary tendencies\" about the central figure of Zola. J.\\r\\nK. Huysmans, then but at the outset of his slow and painful course\\r\\nthrough schools and experiments, was in time to sum up the new\\r\\ntendencies of a new period, as significantly as Maupassant summed up in\\r\\nhis short and brilliant, and almost undeviating career, the tendencies\\r\\nof that period in which Taine and science seemed to have at last found\\r\\nout the physical basis of life. Now it is a new realism which appeals to\\r\\nus: it is the turn of the soul. The battle which the \"Soirees de Medan\"\\r\\nhelped to win has been won; having gained our right to deal with humble\\r\\nand unpleasant and sordidly tragic things in fiction, we are free to\\r\\nconcern ourselves with other things. But though the period has passed,\\r\\nand will not return, the masterpieces of the period remain. Among these\\r\\nmasterpieces are the novels and short stories of Guy de Maupassant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 ARTHUR SYMONS.',\n"," 'BOULE DE SUIF\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days, straggling remnants of the routed army had passed\\r\\nthrough the town. There was no question of organized troops, it was\\r\\nsimply a disjointed rabble, the men unshaven and dirty, their uniforms\\r\\nin tatters, slouching along without regimental colors, without\\r\\norder--worn out, broken down, incapable of thought or resolution,\\r\\nmarching from pure habit and dropping with fatigue the moment they\\r\\nstopped. The majority belonged to the militia, men of peaceful pursuits,\\r\\nretired tradespeople, sinking under the weight of their accouterments;\\r\\nquick-witted little moblets as prone to terror as they were to\\r\\nenthusiasm, as ready to attack as they were to fly; and here and there a\\r\\nfew red trousers, remnants of a company mowed down in one of the big\\r\\nbattles; somber-coated artillerymen, side by side with these various\\r\\nuniforms of the infantry, and now and then the glittering helmet of a\\r\\nheavily booted dragoon who followed with difficulty the march of the\\r\\nlighter-footed soldiers of the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies of franc-tireurs, heroically named \"Avengers of the Defeat,\"\\r\\n\"Citizens of the Tomb,\" \"Companies in Death,\" passed in their turn,\\r\\nlooking like a horde of bandits.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir chiefs--formerly drapers or corn-dealers, retired soap-boilers or\\r\\nsuet-refiners, warriors of circumstance created officers for their money\\r\\nor the length of their moustaches, heaped with arms, flannels, and gold\\r\\nlace--talked loudly, discussed plans of campaign, and gave you to\\r\\nunderstand that they were the sole support of France in her death-agony;\\r\\nbut they were generally in terror of their own soldiers, men \"of the\\r\\nsack and cord,\" most of them brave to foolhardiness, all of them given\\r\\nto pillage and debauchery.\\r\\n\\r\\nReport said that the Prussians were about to enter Rouen. The National\\r\\nGuard, which for two months past had made the most careful\\r\\nreconnoiterings in the neighboring wood, even to the extent of\\r\\noccasionally shooting their own sentries and putting themselves in\\r\\nbattle array if a rabbit stirred in the brushwood, had now retired to\\r\\ntheir domestic hearths; their arms, their uniforms, all the murderous\\r\\napparatus with which they had been wont to strike terror to the hearts\\r\\nof all beholders for three leagues round, had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the last of the French soldiery crossed the Seine on their way\\r\\nto Pont-Audemer by Saint Sever and Bourg-Achard; and then, last of all,\\r\\ncame their despairing general tramping on foot between two orderlies,\\r\\npowerless to attempt any action with these disjointed fragments of his\\r\\nforces, himself utterly dazed and bewildered by the downfall of a people\\r\\naccustomed to victory and now so disastrously beaten in spite of its\\r\\ntraditional bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that a profound calm, the silence of terrified suspense, fell over\\r\\nthe city. Many a rotund bourgeois, emasculated by a purely commercial\\r\\nlife, awaited the arrival of the victors with anxiety, trembling lest\\r\\ntheir meat-skewers and kitchen carving-knives should come under the\\r\\ncategory of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife seemed to have come to a standstill, the shops were closed, the\\r\\nstreets silent. From time to time an inhabitant, intimidated by their\\r\\nsilence, would flit rapidly along the pavement, keeping close to the\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this anguish of suspense, men longed for the coming of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter part of the day following the departure of the French\\r\\ntroops, some Uhlans, appearing from goodness knows where, traversed the\\r\\ncity hastily. A little later, a black mass descended from the direction\\r\\nof Sainte-Catherine, while two more invading torrents poured in from the\\r\\nroads from Darnetal and Bois-guillaume. The advance guards of the three\\r\\ncorps converged at the same moment into the square of the Hotel de\\r\\nVille, while battalion after battalion of the German army wound in\\r\\nthrough the adjacent streets, making the pavement ring under their heavy\\r\\nrhythmic tramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders shouted in strange and guttural tones were echoed back by the\\r\\napparently dead and deserted houses, while from behind the closed\\r\\nshutters eyes peered furtively at the conquerors, masters by right of\\r\\nmight, of the city and the lives and fortunes of its inhabitants. The\\r\\npeople in their darkened dwellings fell a prey to the helpless\\r\\nbewilderment which comes over men before the floods, the devastating\\r\\nupheavals of the earth, against which all wisdom and all force are\\r\\nunavailing. The same phenomenon occurs each time that the established\\r\\norder of things is overthrown, when public security is at an end, and\\r\\nwhen all that the laws of man or of nature protect is at the mercy of\\r\\nsome blind elemental force. The earthquake burying an entire population\\r\\nunder its falling houses; the flood that carries away the drowned body\\r\\nof the peasant with the carcasses of his cattle and the beams torn from\\r\\nhis roof-tree; or the victorious army massacring those who defend their\\r\\nlives, and making prisoners of the rest--pillaging in the name of the\\r\\nsword, and thanking God to the roar of cannon--are so many appalling\\r\\nscourges which overthrow all faith in eternal justice, all the\\r\\nconfidence we are taught to place in the protection of Providence and\\r\\nthe reason of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall detachments now began knocking at the doors and then disappearing\\r\\ninto the houses. It was the occupation after the invasion. It now\\r\\nbehooved the vanquished to make themselves agreeable to the victors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, the first alarms having subsided, a new sense of\\r\\ntranquillity began to establish itself. In many families the Prussian\\r\\nofficer shared the family meals. Not infrequently he was a gentleman,\\r\\nand out of politeness expressed his commiseration with France and his\\r\\nrepugnance at having to take part in such a war. They were grateful\\r\\nenough to him for this sentiment--besides, who knew when they might not\\r\\nbe glad of his protection? By gaining his good offices one might have\\r\\nfewer men to feed. And why offend a person on whom one was utterly\\r\\ndependent? That would not be bravery but temerity, a quality of which\\r\\nthe citizens of Rouen could no longer be accused as in the days of those\\r\\nheroic defenses by which the city had made itself famous. Above all,\\r\\nthey said, with the unassailable urbanity of the Frenchman, it was\\r\\nsurely permissible to be on politely familiar terms in private, provided\\r\\none held aloof from the foreign soldier in public. In the street,\\r\\ntherefore, they ignored one another\\'s existence, but once indoors they\\r\\nwere perfectly ready to be friendly, and each evening found the German\\r\\nstaying longer at the family fireside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town itself gradually regained its wonted aspect. The French\\r\\ninhabitants did not come out much, but the Prussian soldiers swarmed in\\r\\nthe streets. For the rest, the blue hussar officers who trailed their\\r\\nmighty implements of death so arrogantly over the pavement did not\\r\\nappear to entertain a vastly deeper grade of contempt for the simple\\r\\ntownsfolk than did the officers of the Chasseurs who had drunk in the\\r\\nsame cafés the year before. Nevertheless there was a something in the\\r\\nair; something subtle and indefinable, an intolerably unfamiliar\\r\\natmosphere like a widely diffused odor--the odor of invasion. It filled\\r\\nthe private dwellings and the public places, it affected the taste of\\r\\nfood, and gave one the impression of being on a journey, far away from\\r\\nhome, among barbarous and dangerous tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conquerors demanded money--a great deal of money. The inhabitants\\r\\npaid and went on paying; for the matter of that, they were rich. But the\\r\\nwealthier a Normandy tradesman becomes, the more keenly he suffers at\\r\\neach sacrifice each time he sees the smallest particle of his fortune\\r\\npass into the hands of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo or three leagues beyond the town, however, following the course of\\r\\nthe river about Croisset Dieppedalle or Biessard, the sailors and the\\r\\nfishermen would often drag up the swollen corpse of some uniformed\\r\\nGerman, killed by a knife-thrust or a kick, his head smashed in by a\\r\\nstone, or thrown into the water from some bridge. The slime of the river\\r\\nbed swallowed up many a deed of vengeance, obscure, savage, and\\r\\nlegitimate; unknown acts of heroism, silent onslaughts more perilous to\\r\\nthe doer than battles in the light of day and without the trumpet\\r\\nblasts of glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor hatred of the Alien is always strong enough to arm some intrepid\\r\\nbeings who are ready to die for an Idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, seeing that though the invaders had subjected the city to their\\r\\ninflexible discipline they had not committed any of the horrors with\\r\\nwhich rumor had accredited them throughout the length of their triumphal\\r\\nprogress, the worthy tradespeople took heart of grace and the commercial\\r\\nspirit began once more to stir within them. Some of them who had grave\\r\\ninterests at stake at Havre, then occupied by the French army, purposed\\r\\ntrying to reach that port by going overland to Dieppe and there taking\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took advantage of the influence of German officers whose\\r\\nacquaintance they had made, and a passport was obtained from the general\\r\\nin command.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving therefore engaged a large diligence with four horses for the\\r\\njourney, and ten persons having entered their names at the livery stable\\r\\noffice, they resolved to start on the Tuesday morning before daybreak,\\r\\nto avoid all public remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some days already the ground had been hard with frost, and on the\\r\\nMonday, about three o\\'clock in the afternoon, thick dark clouds coming\\r\\nup from the north brought the snow, which fell without intermission all\\r\\nthe evening and during the whole night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half past four the travelers were assembled in the courtyard of the\\r\\nHotel de Normandie, from whence they were to start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all still half asleep, their teeth chattering with cold in\\r\\nspite of their thick wraps. It was difficult to distinguish one from\\r\\nanother in the darkness, their heaped-up winter clothing making them\\r\\nlook like fat priests in long cassocks. Two of the men, however,\\r\\nrecognized each other; they were joined by a third, and they began to\\r\\ntalk. \"I am taking my wife with me,\" said one. \"So am I.\" \"And I too.\"\\r\\nThe first one added: \"We shall not return to Rouen, and if the Prussians\\r\\ncome to Havre we shall slip over to England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all like-minded and all had the same project.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile there was no sign of the horses being put in. A small lantern\\r\\ncarried by a hostler appeared from time to time out of one dark doorway\\r\\nonly to vanish instantly into another. There was a stamping of horses\\'\\r\\nhoofs deadened by the straw of the litter, and the voice of a man\\r\\nspeaking to the animals and cursing sounded from the depths of the\\r\\nstables. A faint sound of bells gave evidence of harnessing, and became\\r\\npresently a clear and continuous jingle timed by the movement of the\\r\\nbeast, now stopping, now going on again with a brisk shake, and\\r\\naccompanied by the dull tramp of hob-nailed sabots.\\r\\n\\r\\nA door closed sharply. All sound ceased. The frozen travelers were\\r\\nsilent, standing stiff and motionless. A veil of white snow-flakes\\r\\nglistened incessantly as it fell to the ground, blotting out the shape\\r\\nof things, powdering everything with an icy froth; and in the utter\\r\\nstillness of the town, quiet and buried under its winter pall, nothing\\r\\nwas audible but this faint, fluttering, and indefinable rustle of\\r\\nfalling snow--more a sensation than a sound--the intermingling of\\r\\nethereal atoms seeming to fill space, to cover the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man reappeared with his lantern, dragging after him by a rope a\\r\\ndejected and unwilling horse. He pushed it against the pole, fixed the\\r\\ntraces, and was occupied for a long time in buckling the harness, having\\r\\nonly the use of one hand as he carried the lantern in the other. As he\\r\\nturned away to fetch the other horse he caught sight of the motionless\\r\\ngroup of travelers, by this time white with snow. \"Why don\\'t you get\\r\\ninside the carriage?\" he said, \"you would at least be under cover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had never occurred to them, and they made a rush for it. The three\\r\\nmen packed their wives into the upper end and then got in themselves,\\r\\nafter which other distinct and veiled forms took the remaining seats\\r\\nwithout exchanging a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor of the vehicle was covered with straw into which the feet\\r\\nsank. The ladies at the end, who had brought little copper charcoal\\r\\nfoot-warmers, proceeded to light them, and for some time discussed their\\r\\nmerits in subdued tones, repeating to one another things which they had\\r\\nknown all their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the diligence having been furnished with six horses instead of\\r\\nfour on account of the difficulties of the road, a voice outside asked,\\r\\n\"Is everybody here?\" A voice from within answered \"Yes,\" and they\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conveyance advanced slowly--slowly--the wheels sinking in the snow;\\r\\nthe whole vehicle groaned and creaked, the horses slipped, wheezed, and\\r\\nsmoked, and the driver\\'s gigantic whip cracked incessantly, flying from\\r\\nside to side, twining and untwining like a slender snake, and cutting\\r\\nsharply across one or other of the six humping backs, which would\\r\\nthereupon straighten up with a more violent effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperceptibly the day grew. The airy flakes which a traveler--a\\r\\nRouennais \"pur sang\"--once likened to a shower of cotton, had ceased to\\r\\nfall; a dirty gray light filtered through the heavy thick clouds which\\r\\nserved to heighten the dazzling whiteness of the landscape, where now a\\r\\nlong line of trees crusted with icicles would appear, now a cottage with\\r\\na hood of snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of this melancholy dawn the occupants of the diligence\\r\\nbegan to examine one another curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight at the end, in the best seats, opposite to one another, dozed\\r\\nMadame and Monsieur Loiseau, whole-sale wine merchant of the Rue Grand\\r\\nPont.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former salesman of a master who had become bankrupt, Loiseau had\\r\\nbought up the stock and made his fortune. He sold very bad wine at very\\r\\nlow prices to the small country retail dealers, and enjoyed the\\r\\nreputation among his friends and acquaintances of being an unmitigated\\r\\nrogue, a thorough Norman full of trickery and jovial humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis character for knavery was so well established that one evening at\\r\\nthe Prefecture, Monsieur Tournel, a man of keen and trenchant wit,\\r\\nauthor of certain fables and songs--a local glory--seeing the ladies\\r\\ngrowing drowsy, proposed a game of \"L\\'oiseau vole.\"[1] The pun itself\\r\\nflew through the prefect\\'s reception rooms and afterwards through the\\r\\ntown, and for a whole month called up a grin on every face in the\\r\\nprovince.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau was himself a noted wag and famous for his jokes both good and\\r\\nbad, and nobody ever mentioned him without adding immediately, \"That\\r\\nLoiseau is simply priceless!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was of medium height with a balloon-like stomach and a rubicund face\\r\\nframed in grizzled whiskers. His wife--tall, strong, resolute, loud in\\r\\nvoice and rapid of decision--represented order and arithmetic in the\\r\\nbusiness, which he enlivened by his jollity and bustling activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside them, in a more dignified attitude as befitted his superior\\r\\nstation, sat Monsieur Carré-Lamadon, a man of weight; an authority on\\r\\ncotton, proprietor of three branch businesses, officer of the Legion of\\r\\nHonor and member of the General Council. All the time of the Empire he\\r\\nhad remained leader of a friendly opposition, for the sole purpose of\\r\\nmaking a better thing out of it when he came round to the cause which he\\r\\nhad fought with polite weapons, to use his own expression. Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon, who was much younger than her husband, was the\\r\\nconsolation of all officers of good family who might be quartered at the\\r\\nRouen garrison. She sat there opposite to her husband, very small, very\\r\\ndainty, very pretty, wrapped in her furs, and regarding the lamentable\\r\\ninterior of the vehicle with despairing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir neighbors, the Count and Countess Hubert de Breville, bore one of\\r\\nthe most ancient and noble names in Normandy. The Count, an elderly\\r\\ngentleman of dignified appearance, did all in his power to accentuate by\\r\\nevery artifice of the toilet his natural resemblance to Henri Quatre,\\r\\nwho, according to a legend of the utmost glory to the family, had\\r\\nhonored with his royal embraces a Dame de Breville, whose husband had,\\r\\nin consequence, been made Count and Governor of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nA colleague of Monsieur Carré-Lamadon in the General Council, Count\\r\\nHubert represented the Orleanist faction in the department. The history\\r\\nof his marriage with the daughter of a small tradesman of Nantes had\\r\\nalways remained a mystery. But as the Countess had an air of grandeur,\\r\\nunderstood better than any one else the art of receiving, passed even\\r\\nfor having been beloved by one of the sons of Louis Philippe, the\\r\\nneighboring nobility bowed down to her, and her salon held the first\\r\\nplace in the county, the only one which preserved the traditions of the\\r\\nviel le galanterie and to which the entreé was difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fortune of the Brevilles--all in Government Funds--was reported to\\r\\nyield them an income of five hundred thousand francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six passengers occupied the upper end of the conveyance, the\\r\\nrepresentatives of revenued society, serene in the consciousness of its\\r\\nstrength--honest well-to-do people possessed of Religion and Principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some strange chance all the women were seated on the same side, the\\r\\nCountess having two sisters of Mercy for neighbors, wholly occupied in\\r\\nfingering their long rosaries and mumbling Paters and Aves. One of them\\r\\nwas old and so deeply pitted with the small-pox that she looked as if\\r\\nshe had received a charge of grape shot full in the face; the other was\\r\\nvery shadowy and frail, with a pretty unhealthy little face, a narrow\\r\\nphthisical chest, consumed by that devouring faith which creates martyrs\\r\\nand ecstatics.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated opposite to the two nuns were a man and woman who excited a good\\r\\ndeal of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, who was well known, was Cornudet, \"the demon,\" the terror of\\r\\nall respectable, law-abiding people. For twenty years he had dipped his\\r\\ngreat red beard into the beer mugs of all the democratic café\\'s. In the\\r\\ncompany of kindred spirits he had managed to run through a comfortable\\r\\nlittle fortune inherited from his father, a confectioner, and he looked\\r\\nforward with impatience to the Republic, when he should obtain the\\r\\nwell-merited reward for so many revolutionary draughts. On the Fourth of\\r\\nSeptember--probably through some practical joke--he understood that he\\r\\nhad been appointed prefect, but on attempting to enter upon his duties\\r\\nthe clerks, who had remained sole masters of the offices, refused to\\r\\nrecognize him, and he was constrained to retire. For the rest, he was a\\r\\ngood fellow, inoffensive and serviceable, and had busied himself with\\r\\nincomparable industry in organizing the defense of the town; had had\\r\\nholes dug all over the plain, cut down all the young trees in the\\r\\nneighboring woods, scattered pitfalls up and down all the high roads,\\r\\nand at the threatened approach of the enemy--satisfied with his\\r\\npreparations--had fallen back with all haste on the town. He now\\r\\nconsidered that he would be more useful in Havre, where fresh\\r\\nentrenchments would soon become necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, one of the so-called \"gay\" sisterhood, was noted for her\\r\\nprecocious stoutness, which had gained her the nickname of \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\"--\"ball of fat.\" She was a little roly-poly creature, cushioned\\r\\nwith fat, with podgy fingers squeezed in at the joints like rows of\\r\\nthick, short sausages; her skin tightly stretched and shiny, her bust\\r\\nenormous, and yet with it all so wholesomely, temptingly fresh and\\r\\nappetizing that it was a pleasure to look at her. Her face was like a\\r\\nruddy apple--a peony rose just burst into bloom--and out of it gazed a\\r\\npair of magnificent dark eyes overshadowed by long thick lashes that\\r\\ndeepened their blackness; and lower down, a charming little mouth, dewy\\r\\nto the kiss, and furnished with a row of tiny milk-white teeth. Over and\\r\\nabove all this she was, they said, full of inestimable qualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was her identity recognized than a whisper ran through the\\r\\nladies in which the words \"prostitute\" and \"public scandal,\" were so\\r\\nconspicuously distinct that she raised her head and retaliated by\\r\\nsweeping her companions with such a bold and defiant look that deep\\r\\nsilence instantly fell upon them, and they all cast down their eyes with\\r\\nthe exception of Loiseau, who watched her with a kindling eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, conversation was soon resumed between the three ladies, whom\\r\\nthe presence of this \"person\" had suddenly rendered friendly--almost\\r\\nintimate. It seemed to them that they must, as it were, raise a rampart\\r\\nof their dignity as spouses between them and this shameless creature who\\r\\nmade a traffic of herself; for legalized love always takes a high hand\\r\\nwith her unlicensed sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men too, drawn to one another by a conservative instinct at\\r\\nsight of Cornudet, talked money in a certain tone of contempt for the\\r\\nimpecunious. Count Hubert spoke of the damage inflicted on him by the\\r\\nPrussians, of the losses which would result to him from the seizing of\\r\\ncattle and from ruined crops, but with all the assurance of a great\\r\\nlanded proprietor, ten times millionaire, whom these ravages might\\r\\ninconvenience for the space of a year at most. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon,\\r\\nof great experience in the cotton industry, had taken the precaution to\\r\\nsend six hundred thousand francs across to England as provision against\\r\\na rainy day. As for Loiseau, he made arrangements to sell all the wine\\r\\nin his cellars to the French commission of supplies, consequently the\\r\\nGovernment owed him a formidable sum, which he counted upon receiving at\\r\\nHavre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three exchanged rapid and amicable glances. Although differing in\\r\\nposition they felt themselves brothers in money, and of the great\\r\\nfreemasonry of those who possess, of those who can make the gold jingle\\r\\nwhen they put their hands in the breeches-pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diligence went so slowly that by ten o\\'clock in the morning they had\\r\\nnot made four leagues. The men got out three times and climbed the hill\\r\\non foot. They began to grow anxious, for they were to have lunched at\\r\\nTotes, and now they despaired of reaching that place before night.\\r\\nEverybody was on the look-out for some inn by the way, when the vehicle\\r\\nstuck fast in a snowdrift, and it took two hours to get it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the pangs of hunger began to affect them severely both in mind\\r\\nand body, and yet not an inn, not a tavern even, was to be seen; the\\r\\napproach of the Prussians and the passage of the famished French troops\\r\\nhad frightened away all trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen foraged diligently for the provisions in the farms by the\\r\\nroadside; but they failed to obtain so much as a piece of bread, for the\\r\\nmistrustful peasant hid all reserve stores for fear of being pillaged by\\r\\nthe soldiers, who, having no food supplied to them, took by force\\r\\neverything they could lay their hands on.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards one o\\'clock Loiseau announced that he felt a very decided void\\r\\nin his stomach. Everybody had been suffering in the same manner for a\\r\\nlong time, and the violent longing for food had extinguished\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time to time some one would yawn, to be almost immediately imitated\\r\\nby another and then each of the rest in turn, and according to their\\r\\ndisposition, manners, or social standing, would open their mouth\\r\\nnoisily, or modestly cover with the hand the gaping cavity from which\\r\\nthe breath issued in a vapor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif had several times stooped down as if feeling for something\\r\\nunder her skirts. She hesitated a moment, looked at her companions, and\\r\\nthen composedly resumed her former position. The faces were pale and\\r\\ndrawn. Loiseau declared he would give a thousand francs for a ham. His\\r\\nwife made a faint movement as to protest, but restrained herself. It\\r\\nalways affected her painfully to hear of money being thrown away, nor\\r\\ncould she even understand a joke upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To tell the truth,\" said the Count, \"I do not feel quite myself\\r\\neither--how could I have omitted to think of bringing provisions?\" And\\r\\neverybody reproached themselves with the same neglectfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, however, had a flask of rum which he offered round. It was\\r\\ncoldly refused. Loiseau alone accepted a mouthful, and handed back the\\r\\nflask with thanks saying, \"That\\'s good! that warms you up and keeps the\\r\\nhunger off a bit.\" The alcohol raised his spirits somewhat, and he\\r\\nproposed that they should do the same as on the little ship in the\\r\\nsong--eat the fattest of the passengers. This indirect but obvious\\r\\nallusion to Boule De Suif shocked the gentle people. Nobody responded\\r\\nand only Cornudet smiled. The two Sisters of Mercy had ceased to tell\\r\\ntheir beads and sat motionless, their hands buried in their wide\\r\\nsleeves, their eyes obstinately lowered, doubtless engaged in offering\\r\\nback to Heaven the sacrifice of suffering which it sent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, at three o\\'clock, when they were in the middle of an\\r\\ninterminable stretch of bare country without a single village in sight,\\r\\nBoule de Suif, stooping hurriedly, drew from under the seat a large\\r\\nbasket covered with a white napkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of it she took, first of all, a little china plate and a delicate\\r\\nsilver drinking-cup, and then an immense dish, in which two whole fowls\\r\\nready carved lay stiffened in their jelly. Other good things were\\r\\nvisible in the basket: patties, fruits, pastry--in fact provisions for a\\r\\nthree days\\' journey in order to be independent of inn cookery. The necks\\r\\nof four bottles protruded from between the parcels of food. She took the\\r\\nwing of a fowl and began to eat it daintily with one of those little\\r\\nrolls which they call \"Regence\" in Normandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery eye was fixed upon her. As the odor of the food spread through the\\r\\ncarriage nostrils began to quiver and mouths to fill with water, while\\r\\nthe jaws, just below the ears contracted painfully. The dislike\\r\\nentertained by the ladies for this abandoned young woman grew savage,\\r\\nalmost to the point of longing to murder her or at least to turn her out\\r\\ninto the snow, her and her drinking-cup and her basket and her\\r\\nprovisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, was devouring the dish of chicken with his eyes.\\r\\n\"Madame has been more prudent than we,\" he said. \"Some people always\\r\\nthink of everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head in his direction. \"If you would care for any,\\r\\nMonsieur--? It is not comfortable to fast for so long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed. \"Ma foi!--frankly, I won\\'t refuse. I can\\'t stand this any\\r\\nlonger--the fortune of war, is it not, madame?\" And with a comprehensive\\r\\nlook he added: \"In moments such as this we are only too glad to find any\\r\\none who will oblige us.\" He had a newspaper which he spread on his knee\\r\\nto save his trousers, and with the point of a knife which he always\\r\\ncarried in his pocket he captured a drumstick all glazed with jelly,\\r\\ntore it with his teeth, and then proceeded to chew it with satisfaction\\r\\nso evident that a deep groan of distress went up from the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this Boule de Suif in a gentle and humble tone invited the two\\r\\nSisters to share the collation. They both accepted on the spot, and\\r\\nwithout raising their eyes began to eat very hurriedly, after stammering\\r\\na few words of thanks. Nor did Cornudet refuse his neighbor\\'s offer, and\\r\\nwith the Sisters they formed a kind of table by spreading out newspapers\\r\\non their knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jaws opened and shut without a pause, biting, chewing, gulping\\r\\nferociously. Loiseau, hard at work in his corner, urged his wife in a\\r\\nlow voice to follow his example. She resisted for some time, then, after\\r\\na pang which gripped her very vitals, she gave in. Whereupon her\\r\\nhusband, rounding off his phrases, asked if their \"charming\\r\\nfellow-traveler\" would permit him to offer a little something to Madame\\r\\nLoiseau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes, certainly, Monsieur,\" she answered with a pleasant smile, and\\r\\nhanded him the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment of embarrassment when the first bottle of claret was\\r\\nuncorked--there was but the one drinking-cup. Each one wiped it before\\r\\npassing it to the rest. Cornudet alone, from an impulse of gallantry no\\r\\ndoubt, placed his lips on the spot still wet from the lips of his\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was that, surrounded by people who were eating, suffocated by\\r\\nthe fragrant odor of the viands, the Count and Countess de Breville and\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Carré-Lamadon suffered the agonies of that torture\\r\\nwhich has ever been associated with the name of Tantalus. Suddenly the\\r\\nyoung wife of the cotton manufacturer gave a deep sigh. Every head\\r\\nturned towards her; she was as white as the snow outside, her eyes\\r\\nclosed, her head fell forward--she had fainted. Her husband, distraught\\r\\nwith fear, implored assistance of the whole company. All lost their\\r\\nheads till the elder of the two Sisters, who supported the unconscious\\r\\nlady, forced Boule de Suif\\'s drinking-cup between her lips and made her\\r\\nswallow a few drops of wine. The pretty creature stirred, opened her\\r\\neyes, smiled and then declared in an expiring voice that she felt quite\\r\\nwell now. But to prevent her being overcome again in the same manner,\\r\\nthe Sister induced her to drink a full cup of wine, adding, \"It is\\r\\nsimply hunger--nothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Boule de Suif, blushing violently, looked at the four starving\\r\\npassengers and faltered shyly, \"Mon Dieu! If I might make so bold as to\\r\\noffer the ladies and gentlemen--\" She stopped short, fearing a rude\\r\\nrebuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, at once threw himself into the breach. \"Parbleu! under\\r\\nsuch circumstances we are all companions in misfortune and bound to help\\r\\neach other. Come, ladies, don\\'t stand on ceremony--take what you can get\\r\\nand be thankful: who knows whether we shall be able to find so much as\\r\\na house where we can spend the night? At this rate we shall not reach\\r\\nTotes till to-morrow afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey still hesitated, nobody having the courage to take upon themselves\\r\\nthe responsibility of the decisive \"Yes.\" Finally the Count seized the\\r\\nbull by the horns. Adopting his most grandiose air, he turned with a bow\\r\\nto the embarrassed young woman and said, \"We accept your offer with\\r\\nthanks, madame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first step only was difficult. The Rubicon once crossed, they fell\\r\\nto with a will. They emptied the basket, which contained, besides the\\r\\nprovisions already mentioned; a pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece\\r\\nof smoked tongue, some pears, a slab of gingerbread, mixed biscuits, and\\r\\na cup of pickled onions and gherkins in vinegar--for, like all women,\\r\\nBoule de Suif adored crudities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not well eat the young woman\\'s provisions and not speak to\\r\\nher, so they conversed--stiffly at first, and then, seeing that she\\r\\nshowed no signs of presuming, with less reserve. Mesdames de Breville\\r\\nand Carré-Lamadon, having a great deal of \"savoir vivre,\" knew how to\\r\\nmake themselves agreeable with tact and delicacy. The Countess, in\\r\\nparticular, exhibited the amiable condescension of the extremely\\r\\nhigh-born lady whom no contact can sully, and was charming. But big\\r\\nMadame Loiseau, who had the soul of a gendarme, remained unmoved,\\r\\nspeaking little and eating much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation naturally turned upon the war. They related horrible\\r\\ndeeds committed by the Prussians and examples of the bravery of the\\r\\nFrench; all these people who were flying rendering full homage to the\\r\\ncourage of those who remained behind. Incidents of personal experience\\r\\nsoon followed, and Boule de Suif told, with that warmth of coloring\\r\\nwhich women of her type often employ in expressing their natural\\r\\nfeelings, how she had come to leave Rouen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought at first I should be able to hold out,\" she said, \"for I had\\r\\nplenty of provisions in my house, and would much rather feed a few\\r\\nsoldiers than turn out of my home and go goodness knows where. But when\\r\\nI saw them--these Prussians--it was too much for me. They made my blood\\r\\nboil with rage, and I cried the whole day for shame. Oh, if I had only\\r\\nbeen a man!--well, there! I watched them from my window--fat pigs that\\r\\nthey were with their spiked helmets--and my servant had to hold my hands\\r\\nto prevent me throwing the furniture down on the top of them. Then some\\r\\nof them came to be quartered on me, and I flew at the throat of the\\r\\nfirst one--they are not harder to strangle than any one else--and would\\r\\nhave finished him too if they had not dragged me off by the hair. Of\\r\\ncourse I had to lie low after that. So as soon as I found an opportunity\\r\\nI left--and here I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody congratulated her. She rose considerably in the estimation of\\r\\nher companions, who had not shown themselves of such valiant mettle, and\\r\\nlistening to her tale, Cornudet smiled the benignant and approving smile\\r\\nof an apostle--as a priest might on hearing a devout person praise the\\r\\nAlmighty; democrats with long beards having the monopoly of patriotism\\r\\nas the men of the cassock possess that of religion. He then took up the\\r\\nparable in a didactic tone with the phraseology culled from the notices\\r\\nposted each day on the walls, and finished up with a flourish of\\r\\neloquence in which he scathingly alluded to \"that blackguard of a\\r\\nBadinguet.\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Boule de Suif fired up at this for she was a Bonapartist. She turned\\r\\nupon him with scarlet cheeks and stammering with indignation, \"Ah! I\\r\\nshould just like to have seen any of you in his place! A nice mess you\\r\\nwould have made of it! It is men of your sort that ruined him, poor man.\\r\\nThere would be nothing for it but to leave France for good if we were\\r\\ngoverned by cowards like you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, nothing daunted, preserved a disdainful and superior smile,\\r\\nbut there was a feeling in the air that high words would soon follow,\\r\\nwhereupon the Count interposed, and managed, not without difficulty, to\\r\\nquiet the infuriated young woman by asserting authoritatively that every\\r\\nsincere opinion was to be respected. Nevertheless the Countess and the\\r\\nmanufacturer\\'s wife, who nourished in their hearts the unreasoning\\r\\nhatred of all well-bred people for the Republic and at the same time\\r\\nthat instinctive weakness of all women for uniformed and despotic\\r\\ngovernments, felt drawn, in spite of themselves, to this woman of the\\r\\nstreet who had so much sense of the fitness of things and whose opinions\\r\\nso closely resembled their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basket was empty--this had not been difficult among ten of\\r\\nthem--they only regretted it was not larger. The conversation was kept\\r\\nup for some little time longer, although somewhat more coldly after they\\r\\nhad finished eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night fell, the darkness grew gradually more profound, and the cold,\\r\\nto which digestion rendered them more sensitive, made even Boule de Suif\\r\\nshiver in spite of her fat. Madame de Breville thereupon offered her\\r\\nher charcoal foot-warmer, which had been replenished several times since\\r\\nthe morning; she accepted with alacrity, for her feet were like ice.\\r\\nMesdames Carré-Lamadon and Loiseau lent theirs to the two Sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver had lit his lanterns, which shed a vivid light over the cloud\\r\\nof vapor that hung over the steaming back of the horses and over the\\r\\nsnow at each side of the road, which seemed to open out under the\\r\\nshifting reflection of the lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the conveyance nothing could be distinguished any longer, but\\r\\nthere was a sudden movement between Boule de Suif and Cornudet, and\\r\\nLoiseau, peering through the gloom, fancied he saw the man with the\\r\\nbeard start back quickly as if he had received a well-directed but\\r\\nnoiseless blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny points of fire appeared upon the road in front. It was Totes. The\\r\\ntravelers had been driving for eleven hours, which, with the four\\r\\nhalf-hours for food and rest to the horses, made thirteen. They entered\\r\\nthe town and stopped in front of the Hotel de la Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened. A familiar sound caused every passenger to tremble--it\\r\\nwas the clink of a scabbard on the stones. At the same moment a German\\r\\nvoice called out something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the diligence had stopped, nobody attempted to get out, as\\r\\nthough they expected to be massacred on setting foot to the ground. The\\r\\ndriver then appeared holding up one of the lanterns, which suddenly\\r\\nillumined the vehicle to its farthest corner and revealed the two rows\\r\\nof bewildered faces with their open mouths and startled eyes wide with\\r\\nalarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside the driver in the full glare of the light stood a German\\r\\nofficer, a tall young man excessively slender and blonde, compressed\\r\\ninto his uniform like a girl in her stays, and wearing, well over one\\r\\near, a flat black wax-cloth cap like the \"Boots\" of an English hotel.\\r\\nHis preposterously long moustache, which was drawn out stiff and\\r\\nstraight, and tapered away indefinitely to each side till it finished\\r\\noff in a single thread so thin that it was impossible to say where it\\r\\nended, seemed to weigh upon the corners of his mouth and form a deep\\r\\nfurrow in either cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Alsatian-French and stern accents he invited the passengers to\\r\\ndescend: \"Vill you get out, chentlemen and laties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters were the first to obey with the docility of holy women\\r\\naccustomed to unfaltering submission. The Count and Countess appeared\\r\\nnext, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, and after them Loiseau\\r\\npushing his better half in front of him. As he set foot to the ground he\\r\\nremarked to the officer, more from motives of prudence than politeness,\\r\\n\"Good evening, Monsieur,\" to which the other with the insolence of the\\r\\nman in possession, vouchsafed no reply but a stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif and Cornudet, though the nearest the door, were the last\\r\\nto emerge--grave and haughty in face of the enemy. The buxom young woman\\r\\nstruggled hard to command herself and be calm; the democrat tugged at\\r\\nhis long rusty beard with a tragic and slightly trembling hand. They\\r\\nsought to preserve their dignity, realizing that in such encounters each\\r\\none, to a certain extent, represents his country; and the two being\\r\\nsimilarly disgusted at the servile readiness of their companions, she\\r\\nendeavored to show herself prouder than her fellow travelers who were\\r\\nhonest women, while he, feeling that he must set an example, continued\\r\\nin his attitude his mission of resistance begun by digging pitfalls in\\r\\nthe high roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all entered the huge kitchen of the inn, and the German, having\\r\\nbeen presented with the passport signed by the general in command--where\\r\\neach traveler\\'s name was accompanied by a personal description and a\\r\\nstatement as to his or her profession--he proceeded to scrutinize the\\r\\nparty for a long time, comparing the persons with the written notices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he exclaimed unceremoniously, \"C\\'est pien--that\\'s all right,\"\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey breathed again more freely. Hunger having reasserted itself, supper\\r\\nwas ordered. It would take half an hour to prepare, so while two\\r\\nservants were apparently busied about it the travelers dispersed to look\\r\\nat their rooms. These were all together down each side of a long passage\\r\\nending in a door with ground glass panels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, just as they were sitting down to table, the innkeeper himself\\r\\nappeared. He was a former horse-dealer, a stout asthmatic man with\\r\\nperpetual wheezings and blowings and rattlings of phlegm in his throat.\\r\\nHis father had transmitted to him the name of Follenvie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif started and turned round. \"That is my name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle, the Prussian officer wants to speak to you at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if you really are Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated, thought for a moment, and then declared roundly: \"That\\r\\nmay be, but I\\'m not going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement round about her--everybody was much exercised as to\\r\\nthe reason of this summons. The Count came over to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may do wrong to refuse, madame, for it may entail considerable\\r\\nannoyance not only to yourself but on the rest of your companions. It is\\r\\na fatal mistake ever to offer resistance to people who are stronger than\\r\\nourselves. The step can have no possible danger for you--it is probably\\r\\nabout some little formality that has been omitted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne and all concurred with him, implored and urged and scolded, till\\r\\nthey ended by convincing her; for they were all apprehensive of the\\r\\nresults of her contumacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I do it for you sure enough!\" she said at last. The Countess\\r\\npressed her hand. \"And we are most grateful to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the room, and the others agreed to wait for her before\\r\\nbeginning the meal. Each one lamented at not having been asked for\\r\\ninstead of this hot-headed, violent young woman, and mentally prepared\\r\\nany number of platitudes for the event of being called in their turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of ten minutes she returned, crimson with rage, choking,\\r\\nsnorting,--\"Oh, the blackguard; the low blackguard!\" she stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all crowded round her to know what had happened, but she would not\\r\\nsay, and the Count becoming insistent, she answered with much dignity,\\r\\n\"No, it does not concern anybody! I can\\'t speak of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then seated themselves round a great soup tureen from which steamed\\r\\na smell of cabbage. In spite of this little contretemps the supper was\\r\\na gay one. The cider, of which the Loiseaus and the two nuns partook\\r\\nfrom motives of economy, was good. The rest ordered wine and Cornudet\\r\\ncalled for beer. He had a particular way with him of uncorking the\\r\\nbottle, of making the liquid froth, of gazing at it while he tilted the\\r\\nglass, which he then held up between his eye and the light to criticise\\r\\nthe color; while he drank, his great beard, which had the tints of his\\r\\nfavorite beverage, seemed to quiver fondly, his eyes squinting that he\\r\\nmight not lose sight of his tankard for a moment, and altogether he had\\r\\nthe appearance of fulfilling the sole function for which he had been\\r\\nborn. You would have said that he established in his own mind some\\r\\nconnection or affinity between the two great passions that monopolized\\r\\nhis life--Ale and Revolution--and most assuredly he never dipped into\\r\\nthe one without thinking of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Follenvie supped at the farther end of the table.\\r\\nThe husband--puffing and blowing like a bursting locomotive--had too\\r\\nmuch cold on the chest to be able to speak and eat at the same time, but\\r\\nhis wife never ceased talking. She described her every impression at the\\r\\narrival of the Prussians and all they did and all they said, execrating\\r\\nthem in the first place because they cost so much, and secondly because\\r\\nshe had two sons in the army. She addressed herself chiefly to the\\r\\nCountess, as it flattered her to be able to say she had conversed with a\\r\\nlady of quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe presently lowered her voice and proceeded to recount some rather\\r\\ndelicate matters, her husband breaking in from time to time with--\"You\\r\\nhad much better hold your tongue, Madame Follenvie,\"--to which she paid\\r\\nnot the slightest attention, but went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, madame, as I was saying--these men, they do nothing but eat\\r\\npotatoes and pork and pork and potatoes from morning till night. And as\\r\\nfor their habits--! And you should see them exercising for hours and\\r\\ndays together out there in the fields--It\\'s forward march and backward\\r\\nmarch, and turn this way and turn that. If they even worked in the\\r\\nfields or mended the roads in their own country! But, no, madame, these\\r\\nsoldiers are no good to anybody, and the poor people have to keep them\\r\\nand feed them simply that they may learn how to massacre. I know I am\\r\\nonly a poor ignorant old woman, but when I see these men wearing\\r\\nthemselves out by tramping up and down from morning till night, I cannot\\r\\nhelp saying to myself, if there are some people who make a lot of useful\\r\\ndiscoveries, why should others give themselves so much trouble to do\\r\\nharm? After all, isn\\'t it an abomination to kill anybody, no matter\\r\\nwhether they are Prussians, or English, or Poles, or French? If you\\r\\nrevenge yourself on some one who has harmed you that is wicked, and you\\r\\nare taken up and punished; but let them shoot down our sons as if they\\r\\nwere game, and it is all right, and they give medals to the man who\\r\\nkills the most. No, no, look you, I shall never be able to see any rhyme\\r\\nor reason in that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"War is barbarous if one attacks an unoffending neighbor--it is a sacred\\r\\nduty if one defends one\\'s country,\" remarked Cornudet in a declamatory\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman nodded assent. \"Yes--defending oneself, of course, that\\r\\nis quite another thing; but wouldn\\'t it be better to kill all these\\r\\nkings who do this for their pleasure?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet\\'s eyes flashed. \"Bravo, citizeness!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon was lost in thought. Although he was an ardent\\r\\nadmirer of famous military men, the sound common sense of this peasant\\r\\nwoman\\'s observations made him reflect upon the wealth which would\\r\\nnecessarily accrue to the country if all these unemployed and\\r\\nconsequently ruinous hands--so much unproductive force--were available\\r\\nfor the great industrial works that would take centuries to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau meanwhile had left his seat and gone over beside the innkeeper,\\r\\nto whom he began talking in a low voice. The fat man laughed, coughed,\\r\\nand spat, his unwieldy stomach shaking with mirth at his neighbor\\'s\\r\\njokes, and he bought six hogsheads of claret from him for the spring\\r\\nwhen the Prussians would have cleared out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper was scarcely over when, dropping with fatigue, everybody went off\\r\\nto bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, who had made certain observations, let his wife go to\\r\\nbed and proceeded to glue first his ear and then his eye to the keyhole,\\r\\nendeavoring to penetrate what he called \"the mysteries of the corridor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about half an hour he heard a rustling, and hurrying to the\\r\\nkeyhole, he perceived Boule de Suif looking ampler than ever in a\\r\\ndressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She had a candle\\r\\nin her hand and was going towards the end of the corridor. Then a door\\r\\nat one side opened cautiously, and when she returned after a few\\r\\nminutes, Cornudet in his shirt sleeves was following her. They were\\r\\ntalking in a low voice and presently stood still; Boule de Suif\\r\\napparently defending the entrance of her room with much energy.\\r\\nUnfortunately Loiseau was unable to hear what they said till, at the\\r\\nlast, as they raised their voices somewhat, he caught a word or two.\\r\\nCornudet was insisting eagerly. \"Look here,\" he said, \"you are really\\r\\nvery ridiculous--what difference can it make to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she with an offended air retorted, \"No!--let me tell you there are\\r\\nmoments when that sort of thing won\\'t do; and besides--here--it would be\\r\\na crying shame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe obviously did not understand. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this she grew angry. \"Why?\" and she raised her voice still more, \"you\\r\\ndon\\'t see why? and there are Prussians in the house--in the next room\\r\\nfor all you know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply. This display of patriotic prudery evidently aroused\\r\\nhis failing dignity, for with a brief salute he made for his own door on\\r\\ntiptoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau deeply thrilled and amused, executed a double shuffle in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, donned his nightcap, and slipped into the blankets\\r\\nwhere the bony figure of his spouse already reposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole house sank to silence. But anon there arose from somewhere--it\\r\\nmight have been the cellar, it might have been the attics--impossible to\\r\\ndetermine the direction--a rumbling--sonorous, even, regular, dull,\\r\\nprolonged roar as of a boiler under high steam pressure: Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been decided that they should start at eight o\\'clock the next\\r\\nmorning, so they were all assembled in the kitchen by that hour; but the\\r\\ndiligence, roofed with snow, stood solitary in the middle of the\\r\\ncourtyard without horses or driver. The latter was sought for in vain\\r\\neither in the stables or the coachhouse. The men of the party then\\r\\nresolved to beat the country round for him, and went out accordingly.\\r\\nThey found themselves in the public square with the church at one end,\\r\\nand low-roofed houses down each side in which they caught sight of\\r\\nPrussian soldiers. The first one they came upon was peeling potatoes;\\r\\nfarther on another was washing out a barber\\'s shop; while a third,\\r\\nbearded to the eyes, was soothing a crying child and rocking it to and\\r\\nfro on his knee to quiet it. The big peasant woman whose men were all\\r\\n\"with the army in the war\" were ordering about their docile conquerors\\r\\nand showing them by signs what work they wanted done--chopping wood,\\r\\ngrinding coffee, fetching water; one of them was even doing the washing\\r\\nfor his hostess, a helpless old crone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count, much astonished, stopped the beadle, who happened to come out\\r\\nof the vestry at that moment, and asked the meaning of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" replied the old church rat, \"these are not at all bad. From what I\\r\\nhear they are not Prussians, either; they come from farther off, but\\r\\nwhere I can\\'t say; and they have all left a wife and children at home. I\\r\\nam very sure the women down there are crying for their men, too, and it\\r\\nwill all make a nice lot of misery for them as well as for us. We are\\r\\nnot so badly off here for the moment, because they do not harm and are\\r\\nworking just as if they were in their own homes. You see, Monsieur, the\\r\\npoor always help one another; it is the great people who make the\\r\\nwars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, indignant at the friendly understanding established between\\r\\nthe victors and the vanquished, retired from the scene, preferring to\\r\\nshut himself up in the inn. Loiseau of course must have his joke. \"They\\r\\nare re-populating,\" he said. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon found a more fitting\\r\\nexpression. \"They are repairing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the driver was nowhere to be found. At last he was unearthed in the\\r\\nvillage café hobnobbing fraternally with the officer\\'s orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not have orders to have the diligence ready by eight o\\'clock?\"\\r\\nthe Count asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, but I got another order later on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not to put the horses in at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who gave you that order?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma foi--the Prussian commandant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know--you had better ask him. I am told not to harness the\\r\\nhorses, and so I don\\'t harness them--there you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he tell you so himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur, the innkeeper brought me the message from him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last night, just as I was going to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men returned much disconcerted. They asked for Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, but were informed by the servant that on account of his\\r\\nasthma he never got up before ten o\\'clock--he had even positively\\r\\nforbidden them to awaken him before then except in case of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they asked to see the officer, but that was absolutely impossible,\\r\\nalthough he lodged at the inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to approach him on non-military\\r\\nmatters. So they had to wait. The women returned to their rooms and\\r\\noccupied themselves as best they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet installed himself in the high chimney-corner of the kitchen,\\r\\nwhere a great fire was burning. He had one of the little coffee-room\\r\\ntables brought to him and a can of beer, and puffed away placidly at his\\r\\npipe, which enjoyed among the democrats almost equal consideration with\\r\\nhimself, as if in serving Cornudet it served the country also. The pipe\\r\\nwas a superb meerschaum, admirably colored, black as the teeth of its\\r\\nowner, but fragrant, curved, shining familiar to his hand, and the\\r\\nnatural complement to his physiognomy. He sat there motionless, his eyes\\r\\nfixed alternately on the flame of the hearth and the foam on the top of\\r\\nhis tankard, and each time after drinking he passed his bony fingers\\r\\nwith a self-satisfied gesture through his long greasy hair, while he\\r\\nwiped the fringe of froth from his moustache.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the pretext of stretching his legs, Loiseau went out and palmed\\r\\noff his wines on the country retail dealers. The Count and the\\r\\nmanufacturer talked politics. They forecast the future of France, the\\r\\none putting his faith in the Orleans, the other in an unknown savior, a\\r\\nhero who would come to the fore when things were at their very worst--a\\r\\nDu Guesclin, a Joan of Arc perhaps, or even another Napoleon I. Ah, if\\r\\nonly the Prince Imperial were not so young! Cornudet listened to them\\r\\nwith the smile of a man who could solve the riddle of Fate if he would.\\r\\nHis pipe perfumed the whole kitchen with its balmy fragrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stroke of ten Monsieur Follenvie made his appearance. They\\r\\ninstantly attacked him with questions, but he had but one answer which\\r\\nhe repeated two or three times without variation. \"The officer said to\\r\\nme, \\'Monsieur Follenvie, you will forbid them to harness the horses for\\r\\nthese travelers to-morrow morning. They are not to leave till I give my\\r\\npermission. You understand?\\' That is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey demanded to see the officer; the Count sent up his card, on which\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon added his name and all his titles. The Prussian\\r\\nsent word that he would admit the two men to his presence after he had\\r\\nlunched, that is to say, about one o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies came down and they all managed to eat a little in spite of\\r\\ntheir anxiety. Boule de Suif looked quite ill and very much agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were just finishing coffee when the orderly arrived to fetch the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau joined them, but when they proposed to bring Cornudet along to\\r\\ngive more solemnity to their proceedings, he declared haughtily that\\r\\nnothing would induce him to enter into any communication whatsoever with\\r\\nthe Germans, and he returned to his chimney-corner and ordered another\\r\\nbottle of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men therefore went upstairs without him, and were shown into\\r\\nthe best room of the inn, where they were received by the officer\\r\\nlolling in an armchair, his heels on the chimney-piece, smoking a long\\r\\nporcelain pipe, and arrayed in a flamboyant dressing-gown, taken, no\\r\\ndoubt, from the abandoned dwelling-house of some bourgeois of inferior\\r\\ntaste. He did not rise, he vouchsafed them no greeting of any\\r\\ndescription, he did not even look at them--a brilliant sample of the\\r\\nvictorious military cad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last after some moments waiting he said: \"Vat do you vant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count acted as spokesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We wish to leave, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking the reason for this refusal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pecause I do not shoose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all due respect, Monsieur, I would draw your attention to the fact\\r\\nthat your general gave us a permit for Dieppe, and I cannot see that we\\r\\nhave done anything to justify your hard measures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not shoose--dat\\'s all--you can co town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was miserable. They could make nothing of this caprice of\\r\\nthe German\\'s, and the most far-fetched ideas tortured their minds. The\\r\\nwhole party remained in the kitchen engaging in endless discussions,\\r\\nimagining the most improbable things. Were they to be kept as\\r\\nhostages?--but if so, to what end?--or taken prisoners--or asked a large\\r\\nransom? This last suggestion threw them into a cold perspiration of\\r\\nfear. The wealthiest were seized with the worst panic and saw themselves\\r\\nforced, if they valued their lives, to empty bags of gold into the\\r\\nrapacious hands of this soldier. They racked their brains for plausible\\r\\nlies to dissemble their riches, to pass themselves off as poor--very\\r\\npoor. Loiseau pulled off his watch-chain and hid it in his pocket. As\\r\\nnight fell their apprehensions increased. The lamp was lighted, and as\\r\\nthere were still two hours till supper Madame Loiseau proposed a game\\r\\nof \"trente et un.\" It would be some little distraction, at any rate. The\\r\\nplan was accepted; even Cornudet, who had put out his pipe from motives\\r\\nof politeness, taking a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count shuffled the cards, dealt, Boule de Suif had \"trente et un\" at\\r\\nthe first deal; and very soon the interest in the game allayed the fears\\r\\nwhich beset their minds. Cornudet, however, observed that the two\\r\\nLoiseaus were in league to cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were sitting down to the evening meal Monsieur appeared and\\r\\nsaid in his husky voice: \"The Prussian officer wishes to know if\\r\\nMademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset has not changed her mind yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif remained standing and turned very pale, then suddenly her\\r\\nface flamed and she fell into such a paroxysm of rage that she could not\\r\\nspeak. At last she burst out: \"You can tell that scoundrel--that low\\r\\nscum of a Prussian--that I won\\'t--and I never will--do you hear?--never!\\r\\nnever! never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fat innkeeper retired. They instantly surrounded Boule de Suif,\\r\\nquestioning, entreating her to disclose the mystery of her visit. At\\r\\nfirst she refused, but presently, carried away by her indignation, she\\r\\ntold them in plain terms what he demanded of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general indignation was so violent that nobody was shocked. Cornudet\\r\\nbrought his beer glass down on the table with such a bang that it broke.\\r\\nThere was a perfect babel of invective against the base wretch, a\\r\\nhurricane of wrath, a union of all for resistance, as if each had been\\r\\nrequired to contribute a portion of the sacrifice demanded of the one.\\r\\nThe Count protested with disgust that these people behaved really as if\\r\\nthey were early barbarians. The women, in particular, accorded her the\\r\\nmost lively and affectionate sympathy. The nuns, who only appeared at\\r\\nmeals, dropped their eyes and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fury of the storm having abated, they sat down to supper, but\\r\\nthere was little conversation and a good deal of thoughtful abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies retired early; the men, while they smoked, got up a game of\\r\\necarté, which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to join, as they intended\\r\\npumping him skillfully as to the means that could be employed for\\r\\novercoming the officer\\'s opposition to their departure. Unfortunately,\\r\\nhe would absorb himself wholly in his cards, and neither listened to\\r\\nwhat they said nor gave any answer to their questions, but repeated\\r\\nincessantly, \"Play, gentlemen, play!\" His attention was so deeply\\r\\nengaged that he forgot to cough, with the result of eliciting organ\\r\\ntones from his chest; his wheezing lungs running through the whole gamut\\r\\nof asthma from notes of the profoundest bass to the shrill, hoarse crow\\r\\nof the young cock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe refused to go to bed when his wife, who was dropping with sleep, came\\r\\nto fetch him. She therefore departed alone, for on her devolved the \"day\\r\\nduty,\" and she always rose with the sun, while her husband took the\\r\\n\"night day,\" and was always ready to sit up all night with friends. He\\r\\nmerely called out, \"Mind you put my chicken broth in front of the fire!\"\\r\\nand returned to his cards. When they were convinced that there was\\r\\nnothing to be got out of him, they declared that it was high time to go\\r\\nto bed, and left him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were up again pretty early the next day, filled with an indefinite\\r\\nhope, a still keener desire to be gone, and a horror of another day to\\r\\nbe got through in this odious tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! the horses were still in the stable and the coachman remained\\r\\ninvisible. For lack of something better to do, they sadly wandered round\\r\\nthe diligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLunch was very depressing, and a certain chilliness had sprung up with\\r\\nregard to Boule de Suif, for the night--which brings counsel--had\\r\\nsomewhat modified the heat of their opinions. They were almost vexed\\r\\nwith the girl now for not having gone to the Prussian secretly, and thus\\r\\nprepared a pleasant surprise for her companions in the morning. What\\r\\ncould be simpler, and, after all, who would have been any the wiser? She\\r\\nmight have saved appearances by telling the officer that she could not\\r\\nbear to see their distress any longer. It could make so very little\\r\\ndifference to her one way or another!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as yet, nobody confessed to these thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, as they were feeling bored to extinction, the Count\\r\\nproposed a walk round the village. Everybody wrapped up carefully and\\r\\nthe little party started, with the exception of Cornudet, who preferred\\r\\nsitting by the fire, and the two Sisters, who passed their days in the\\r\\nchurch or with the curé.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold--grown more intense each day--nipped their noses and ears\\r\\nviciously, and the feet became so painful that every step was anguish;\\r\\nbut when they caught sight of the open stretch of country it appeared to\\r\\nthem so appallingly lugubrious under its illimitable white covering that\\r\\nthey turned back with one accord, their hearts constricted, their\\r\\nspirits below zero. The four ladies walked in front, the three men\\r\\nfollowing a little behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, who thoroughly took in the situation, suddenly broke out, \"How\\r\\nlong was this fool of a girl going to keep them hanging on in this\\r\\nhole?\" The Count, courteous as ever, observed that one could not demand\\r\\nso painful a sacrifice of any woman--the offer must come from her.\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon remarked that if--as there was every reason to\\r\\nbelieve--the French made an offensive counter-march by way of Dieppe,\\r\\nthe collision could only take place at Totes. This reflection greatly\\r\\nalarmed the other two. \"Why not escape on foot?\" suggested Loiseau. The\\r\\nCount shrugged his shoulders. \"How can you think of such a thing in this\\r\\nsnow--and with our wives? Besides which, we should instantly be pursued,\\r\\ncaught in ten minutes, and brought back prisoners at the mercy of these\\r\\nsoldiers.\" This was incontestable--there was nothing more to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies talked dress, but a certain constraint seemed to have risen\\r\\nup between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once, at the end of the street, the officer came in sight, his\\r\\ntall figure, like a wasp in uniform, silhouetted against the dazzling\\r\\nbackground of snow, and walking with his knees well apart, with that\\r\\nmovement peculiar to the military when endeavoring to save their\\r\\ncarefully polished boots from the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn passing the ladies he bowed, but only stared contemptuously at the\\r\\nmen, who, be it said, had the dignity not to lift their hats, though\\r\\nLoiseau made a faint gesture in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif blushed up to her eyes, and the three married women felt\\r\\nit a deep humiliation to have encountered this soldier while they were\\r\\nin the company of the young woman he had treated so cavalierly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation then turned upon him, his general appearance, his face.\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon, who had known a great many officers and was\\r\\ncompetent to judge of them \"en connoisseur,\" considered this one really\\r\\nnot half bad--she even regretted that he was not French, he would have\\r\\nmade such a fascinating hussar, and would certainly have been much run\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce indoors again, they did not know what to do with themselves. Sharp\\r\\nwords were exchanged on the most insignificant pretexts. The silent\\r\\ndinner did not last long, and they shortly afterwards went to bed,\\r\\nhoping to kill time by sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came down next morning with jaded faces and tempers on the thin\\r\\nedge. The women scarcely addressed a word to Boule de Suif.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the church bell began to ring; it was for a christening. Boule\\r\\nde Suif had a child out at nurse with some peasants near Yvetot. She did\\r\\nnot see it once in a year and never gave it a thought, but the idea of\\r\\nthis baby which was going to be baptized filled her heart with sudden\\r\\nand violent tenderness for her own, and nothing would satisfy her but\\r\\nthat she should assist at the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was she gone than they all looked at one another and proceeded\\r\\nto draw up their chairs; for everybody felt that things had come to that\\r\\npoint that something must be decided upon. Loiseau had an inspiration:\\r\\nthat they should propose to the officer to keep Boule de Suif and let\\r\\nthe rest go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie undertook the mission, but returned almost\\r\\nimmediately. The German, who had some knowledge of human nature, had\\r\\nsimply turned him out of the room. He meant to retain the whole party\\r\\nso long as his desire was unsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Madame Loiseau\\'s plebeian tendencies got the better of her. \"But\\r\\nsurely we are not going to sit down calmly here and die of old age! As\\r\\nthat is her trade, I don\\'t see that she has any right to refuse one man\\r\\nmore than another. Why, she took anybody she could get in Rouen, down to\\r\\nthe very cab drivers. Oh, yes, I know it positively from the coachman of\\r\\nthe Prefecture, who bought his wine at our shop. And now, when it lies\\r\\nwith her to get us out of this scrape, she pretends to be\\r\\nparticular--the brazen hussy! For my part, I consider the officer has\\r\\nbehaved very well! He has probably not had a chance for some time, and\\r\\nthere were three here whom, no doubt, he would have preferred; but\\r\\nno--he is content to take the one who is public property. He respects\\r\\nmarried women. Remember, he is master here. He had only to say \\'I will,\\'\\r\\nand he could have taken us by force with his soldiers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little shudder ran through the other two women. Pretty little Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon\\'s eyes shone and she turned rather pale as though she\\r\\nalready felt herself forcibly seized by the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men, who had been arguing the matter in a corner, now joined them.\\r\\nLoiseau, foaming with rage, was for delivering up \"the hussy\" bound hand\\r\\nand foot to the enemy. But the Count, coming of three generations of\\r\\nambassadors, and gifted with the physique of the diplomatist, was on the\\r\\nside of skill as opposed to brute force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She must be persuaded,\" he said. Whereupon they conspired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women drew up closer together, voices were lowered, and the\\r\\ndiscussion became general, each one offering his or her advice. Nothing\\r\\nwas said to shock the proprieties. The ladies, in particular, were most\\r\\nexpert in felicitous turns of phrase, charming subtleties of speech for\\r\\nexpressing the most ticklish things. A foreigner would have understood\\r\\nnothing, the language was so carefully veiled. But as the slight coating\\r\\nof modesty with which every woman of the world is enveloped is hardly\\r\\nmore than skin deep, they expanded under the influence of this equivocal\\r\\nadventure, enjoying themselves wildly at bottom, thoroughly in their\\r\\nelement, dabbling in sensuality with the gusto of an epicurean cook\\r\\npreparing a toothsome delicacy for somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story finally appeared to them so funny that they quite recovered\\r\\ntheir spirits. The Count indulged in some rather risky pleasantries, but\\r\\nso well put that they raised a responsive smile; Loiseau, in his turn,\\r\\nrapped out some decidedly strong jokes which nobody took in bad part,\\r\\nand the brutal proposition expressed by his wife swayed all their minds:\\r\\n\"As that is her trade, why refuse one man more than another?\" Little\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon seemed even to think that in her place she would\\r\\nrefuse this one less readily than another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were long in preparing the blockade, as if against an invested\\r\\nfortress. Each one agreed upon the part they would play, the arguments\\r\\nthey would bring forward, the maneuvers they would execute. They\\r\\narranged the plan of attack, the stratagems to be employed, and the\\r\\nsurprises of the assault for forcing this living citadel to receive the\\r\\nenemy within its gates. Cornudet alone held aloof, completely outside\\r\\nthe affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were so profoundly occupied with the matter in hand that they never\\r\\nheard Boule de Suif enter the room. But the Count breathed a low warning\\r\\n\"Hush!\" and they lifted their heads. She was there. The talking ceased\\r\\nabruptly, and a certain feeling of embarrassment prevented them from\\r\\naddressing her at first, till the Countess, more versed than the others\\r\\nin the duplicities of the drawing-room, asked how she had enjoyed the\\r\\nchristening.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill full of emotion at what she had witnessed, Boule de Suif described\\r\\nevery detail--the people\\'s faces, their attitudes, even the appearance\\r\\nof the church. It was so nice to pray now and then, she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill luncheon, however, the ladies confined themselves merely to being\\r\\nagreeable to her in order to increase her confidence in them and her\\r\\ndocility to their counsels. But once seated at the table, the attack\\r\\nbegan. It first took the form of a desultory conversation on devotion to\\r\\na cause. Examples from ancient history were cited: Judith and\\r\\nHolofernes, and then, without any apparent connection, Lucretia and\\r\\nSextus, Cleopatra admitting to her couch all the hostile generals, and\\r\\nreducing them to the servility of slaves. Then began a fantastic\\r\\nhistory, which had sprung up in the minds of these ignorant\\r\\nmillionaires, in which the women of Rome were seen on their way to\\r\\nCapua, to rock Hannibal to sleep in their arms, and his officers along\\r\\nwith him, and the phalanxes of the mercenaries. The women were mentioned\\r\\nwho had arrested the course of conquerors, made of their bodies a\\r\\nrampart, a means of dominating, a weapon; who had vanquished by their\\r\\nheroic embraces beings hideous or repulsive, and sacrificed their\\r\\nchastity to vengeance or patriotism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this in so discreet and moderate a manner, with now and then a\\r\\nlittle burst of warm enthusiasm, admirably calculated to excite\\r\\nemulation. To hear them you would have finally come to the conclusion\\r\\nthat woman\\'s sole mission here below was to perpetually sacrifice her\\r\\nperson, to abandon herself continually to the caprices of the warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters appeared to be deaf to it all, sunk in profound thought.\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey allowed her all the afternoon for reflection, but instead of\\r\\ncalling her \"Madame,\" as they had done up till now, they addressed her\\r\\nsimply as \"Mademoiselle\"--nobody could have said exactly why--as if to\\r\\nsend her down a step in the esteem she had gained, and force her to feel\\r\\nthe shame of her position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening just as the soup was being brought to the table Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie made his appearance again with the same message as before:\\r\\n\"The Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset if she\\r\\nhad not changed her mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur,\" Boule de Suif replied curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt supper the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three jokes that hung\\r\\nfire; everybody beat their brains for fresh instances to the point; and\\r\\nfound none, when the Countess, possibly without premeditation and only\\r\\nfrom a vague desire to render homage to religion, interrogated the older\\r\\nof the two Sisters on the main incidents in the lives of the saints.\\r\\nNow, several of them had committed acts which would be counted crimes in\\r\\nour eyes, but the Church readily pardons such misdeeds when they are\\r\\naccomplished for the glory of God or the benefit of our neighbors. Then\\r\\nby one of those tacit agreements, those veiled complaisances in which\\r\\nevery one who wears ecclesiastical habit excels, or perhaps simply from\\r\\na happy want of intelligence, a helpful stupidity, the old nun brought\\r\\nformidable support to the conspiracy. They had imagined her timid; she\\r\\nproved herself bold, verbose, violent. She was not troubled by any of\\r\\nthe shilly-shallyings of casuistry, her doctrine was like a bar of iron,\\r\\nher faith never wavered, her conscience knew no scruples. She considered\\r\\nAbraham\\'s sacrifice a very simple affair, for she herself would have\\r\\ninstantly killed father or mother at an order from above, and nothing,\\r\\nshe averred, could displease the Lord if the intention were commendable.\\r\\nThe Countess, taking advantage of the sacred authority of her unexpected\\r\\nally, drew her on to make an edifying paraphrase, as it were, on the\\r\\nwell-known moral maxim: \"The end justifies the means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, Sister,\" she inquired, \"you think God approves of every pathway\\r\\nthat leads to Him, and pardons the deed if the motive be a pure one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who can doubt it, Madame? An action blamable in itself is often\\r\\nrendered meritorious by the impulse which inspires it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she continued in the same strain, unraveling the intricacies of the\\r\\nwill of the Almighty, predicting His decisions, making Him interest\\r\\nHimself in matters which, of a truth, did not concern Him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was skillfully and discreetly wrapped up, but each word of the\\r\\npious woman in the big white cap made a breach in the indignant\\r\\nresistance of the courtesan. The conversation then glancing off\\r\\nslightly, the woman of the pendent rosaries went on to speak of the\\r\\nreligious houses of her Order, of her superior, of herself and her\\r\\nfragile little companion, her dear little Sister St. Nicephora. They\\r\\nhad been sent for to Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers there down\\r\\nwith small-pox. She described the condition of these poor wretches, gave\\r\\ndetails of their disorder; and while they were thus stopped upon the\\r\\nroad by the whim of this Prussian, many French soldiers might die whom\\r\\nperhaps they could have saved. That was her specialty--nursing soldiers.\\r\\nShe had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and relating her\\r\\ncampaigns, she suddenly revealed herself as one of those Sisters of the\\r\\nfife and drum who seem made for following the camp, picking up the\\r\\nwounded in the thick of battle, and better than any officer for quelling\\r\\nwith a word the great hulking undisciplined recruits--a regular Sister\\r\\nRataplan, her ravaged face all riddled with pits, calling up an image of\\r\\nthe devastations of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke after her for fear of spoiling the excellent effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after dinner they hurried to their rooms, not to reappear\\r\\ntill pretty late the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuncheon passed off quietly. They allowed the seed sown yesterday time\\r\\nto grow and bear fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the Countess proposed a walk, whereupon the Count,\\r\\nfollowing the preconcerted arrangement, took Boule de Suif\\'s arm and\\r\\nfell behind with her a little. He adopted that familiar, paternal,\\r\\nsomewhat contemptuous tone which elderly men affect towards such girls,\\r\\ncalling her \"my dear child,\" treating her from the height of his social\\r\\nposition and indisputable respectability.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came to the point without further preamble. \"So you prefer to keep us\\r\\nhere exposed like yourself to all the violence which must inevitably\\r\\nfollow a check to the Prussian arms, rather than consent to accord one\\r\\nof those favors you have so often dispensed in your time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif did not reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then appealed to her kindness of heart, her reason, her sentiment. He\\r\\nknew how to remain \"Monsieur le Comte,\" yet showing himself at the same\\r\\ntime chivalrous, flattering--in a word, altogether amiable. He exalted\\r\\nthe sacrifice she would be making for them, touched upon their\\r\\ngratitude, and with a final flash of roguishness, \"Besides, my dear, he\\r\\nmay think himself lucky--he will not find many such pretty girls as you\\r\\nin his own country!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing and rejoined the rest of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned, she went straight to her room and did not come down\\r\\nagain. The anxiety was terrible. What was she going to do? How\\r\\nunspeakably mortifying if she still persisted in her refusal!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, they waited for her in vain. Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, entering presently, announced that Mademoiselle Rousset was\\r\\nindisposed, and that there was consequently no need to delay supper any\\r\\nlonger. They all pricked up their ears. The Countess approached the\\r\\ninnkeeper with a whispered \"All right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor propriety\\'s sake he said nothing to his companions, but he made them\\r\\na slight sign of the head. A great sigh of relief went up from every\\r\\nheart, every face lit up with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Saperlipopette!\" cried Loiseau, \"I will stand champagne if there is\\r\\nsuch a thing in this establishment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Loiseau suffered a pang of anguish when the innkeeper returned\\r\\nwith four bottles in his hands. Everybody suddenly turned communicative\\r\\nand cheerful, and their hearts overflowed with brotherly love. The Count\\r\\nseemed all at once to become aware that Madame Carré-Lamadon was\\r\\ncharming; the manufacturer paid compliments to the Countess.\\r\\nConversation became lively, sprightly, and full of sparkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the repast the women themselves were indulging in\\r\\ndecidedly risky witticisms. Eyes grew bright, tongues were loosened, a\\r\\ngood deal of wine had been consumed. The Count, who, even in his cups,\\r\\nretained his characteristic air of diplomatic gravity, made some highly\\r\\nspiced comparisons on the subject of the end of the winter season at the\\r\\nPole and the joy of ice-bound mariners at sight of an opening to the\\r\\nsouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, now in full swing, rose, and lifting high his glass of\\r\\nchampagne, \"To our deliverance!\" he cried. Everybody started to their\\r\\nfeet with acclamation. Even the two Sisters of Mercy, yielding to the\\r\\nsolicitations of the ladies, consented to take a sip of the effervescing\\r\\nwine which they had never tasted before. They pronounced it to be very\\r\\nlike lemonade, though, on the whole, more refined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity there is no piano,\" said Loiseau as a crowning point to the\\r\\nsituation, \"we might have finished up with a little hop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet had not uttered a word, nor made a sign of joining in the\\r\\ngeneral hilarity; he was apparently plunged in the gravest abstractions,\\r\\nonly pulling viciously at his great beard from time to time as if to\\r\\ndraw it out longer than before. At last, about midnight, when the\\r\\ncompany was preparing to separate, Loiseau came hiccoughing over to\\r\\nhim, and digging him in the ribs: \"You seem rather down in the mouth\\r\\nthis evening, citizen--haven\\'t said a word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet threw up his head angrily, and sweeping the company with a\\r\\nflashing and terrible look: \"I tell you all that what you have done\\r\\nto-day is an infamy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose, made his way to the door, exclaimed once again, \"An infamy!\"\\r\\nand vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis somewhat dashed their spirits for the moment. Loiseau, nonplussed\\r\\nat first, soon regained his aplomb and burst into a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\"Sour grapes, old man--sour grapes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others not understanding the allusion, he proceeded to relate the\\r\\n\"mysteries of the corridor.\" This was followed by an uproarious revival\\r\\nof gayety. The ladies were in a frenzy of delight, the Count and\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon laughed till they cried. They could not believe\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say he wanted--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you I saw it with my own eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because the Prussian was in the next room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is incredible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As true as I stand here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count nearly choked; the manufacturer held both his sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you can understand that he does not quite see the joke of the thing\\r\\nthis evening--oh, no--not at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they all three went off again, breathless, choking, sick with\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that they parted for the night. But Madame Loiseau remarked to her\\r\\nhusband when they were alone that that little cat of a Carré-Lamadon\\r\\nhad laughed on the wrong side of her mouth all the evening. \"You know\\r\\nhow it is with these women--they dote upon a uniform, and whether it is\\r\\nFrench or Prussian matters precious little to them. But, Lord--it seems\\r\\nto me a poor way of looking at things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently nobody got much sleep that night, for it was long before the\\r\\nlights ceased to shine under the doors. Champagne, they say, often has\\r\\nthat disturbing effect; it makes one restless and wakeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning a brilliant winter sun shone on the dazzling snow. The\\r\\ndiligence was by this time ready and waiting before the door, while a\\r\\nflock of white pigeons, muffled in their thick plumage, strutted\\r\\nsolemnly in and out among the feet of the six horses, seeking what they\\r\\nmight devour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver, enveloped in his sheepskin, sat on the box smoking his pipe,\\r\\nand the radiant travelers were busily laying in provisions for the rest\\r\\nof the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were only waiting now for Boule de Suif. She appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked agitated and downcast as she advanced timidly towards her\\r\\nfellow travelers, who all, with one movement, turned away their heads as\\r\\nif they had not seen her. The Count, with a dignified movement, took his\\r\\nwife by the arm and drew her away from this contaminating contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor thing stopped short, bewildered; then gathering up her courage\\r\\nshe accosted the wife of the manufacturer with a humble \"Good morning,\\r\\nMadame.\" The other merely replied with an impertinent little nod,\\r\\naccompanied by a stare of outraged virtue. Everybody seemed suddenly\\r\\nextremely busy, and they avoided her as if she had brought the plague\\r\\nin her skirts. They then precipitated themselves into the vehicle, where\\r\\nshe arrived the last and by herself, and resumed in silence the seat she\\r\\nhad occupied during the first part of the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey affected not to see her, not to recognize her; only Madame Loiseau,\\r\\nglancing round at her with scorn and indignation, said half audibly to\\r\\nher husband, \"It\\'s a good thing that I am not sitting beside her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy conveyance jolted off, and the journey recommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke for the first little while. Boule de Suif did not venture\\r\\nto raise her eyes. She felt incensed at her companions, and at the same\\r\\ntime deeply humiliated at having yielded to their persuasions, and let\\r\\nherself be sullied by the kisses of this Prussian into whose arms they\\r\\nhad hypocritically thrust her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess was the first to break the uncomfortable silence. Turning\\r\\nto Madame Carré-Lamadon, she said, \"You know Madame d\\'Etrelles, I\\r\\nthink?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; she is a great friend of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming woman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fascinating! So truly refined; very cultivated, too, and an artist to\\r\\nthe tips of her fingers--she sings delightfully, and draws to\\r\\nperfection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manufacturer was talking to the Count, and through the rattle\\r\\nof the crazy windowpanes one caught a word here and there;\\r\\nshares--dividends--premium--settling day--and the like. Loiseau, who had\\r\\nappropriated an old pack of cards from the inn, thick with the grease of\\r\\nthe five years\\' rubbing on dirty tables, started a game of bezique with\\r\\nhis wife. The two Sisters pulled up the long rosaries hanging at their\\r\\nwaists, made the sign of the cross, and suddenly began moving their lips\\r\\nrapidly, faster and faster, hurrying their vague babble as if for a\\r\\nwager; kissing a medal from time to time, crossing themselves again, and\\r\\nthen resuming their rapid and monotonous murmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet sat motionless--thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the three hours\\' steady traveling Loiseau gathered up his\\r\\ncards and remarked facetiously, \"It\\'s turning hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife then produced a parcel, which she untied, and brought out a\\r\\npiece of cold veal. This she cut up into thin, firm slices, and both\\r\\nbegan to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supposing we do the same?\" said the Countess, and proceeded to unpack\\r\\nthe provisions prepared for both couples. In one of those oblong dishes\\r\\nwith a china hare upon the cover to indicate that a roast hare lies\\r\\nbeneath, was a succulent selection of cold viands--brown slices of juicy\\r\\nvenison mingled with other meats. A delicious square of gruyere cheese\\r\\nwrapped in newspaper still bore imprinted on its dewy surface the words\\r\\n\"General News.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters brought out a sausage smelling of garlic, and Cornudet,\\r\\nplunging his hands into the vast pockets of his loose greatcoat, drew up\\r\\nfour hard-boiled eggs from one and a big crust of bread from the other.\\r\\nHe peeled off the shells and threw them into the straw under his feet,\\r\\nand proceeded to bite into the egg, dropping pieces of the yolk into his\\r\\nlong beard, from whence they shone out like stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hurry and confusion of the morning Boule de Suif had omitted to\\r\\ntake thought for the future, and she looked on, furious, choking with\\r\\nmortification, at these people all munching away so placidly. A storm\\r\\nof rage convulsed her, and she opened her mouth to hurl at them the\\r\\ntorrent of abuse that rose to her lips, but she could not speak,\\r\\nsuffocated by her indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody looked at her, nobody thought of her. She felt herself drowning\\r\\nin the flood of contempt shown towards her by these honest scoundrels\\r\\nwho had first sacrificed her and then cast her off like some useless and\\r\\nunclean thing. Then her thoughts reverted to her great basket full of\\r\\ngood things which they had so greedily devoured--the two fowls in their\\r\\nglittering coat of jelly, her patties, her pears, her four bottles of\\r\\nclaret; and her fury suddenly subsided like the breaking of an\\r\\noverstrung chord and she felt that she was on the verge of tears. She\\r\\nmade the most strenuous efforts to overcome it--straightened herself up\\r\\nand choked back her sobs as children do, but the tears would rise. They\\r\\nglittered for a moment on her lashes, and presently two big drops rolled\\r\\nslowly over her cheeks. Others gathered in quick succession like water\\r\\ndripping from a rock and splashed onto the ample curve of her bosom. She\\r\\nsat up very straight, her eyes fixed, her face pale and rigid, hoping\\r\\nthat nobody would notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Countess saw her and nudged her husband. He shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders as much as to say, \"What can you expect? It is not my fault.\"\\r\\nMadame Loiseau gave a silent chuckle of triumph and murmured, \"She is\\r\\ncrying for shame.\" The two Sisters had resumed their devotions after\\r\\ncarefully wrapping up the remnants of their sausages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Cornudet, while digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under\\r\\nthe opposite seat, leaned back, smiled like a man who has just thought\\r\\nof a capital joke, and began to softly whistle the Marseillaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe faces clouded; the popular air seemed unpleasing to his neighbors;\\r\\nthey became nervous--irritable--looking as if they were ready to throw\\r\\nback their heads and howl like dogs at the sound of a barrel organ. He\\r\\nwas perfectly aware of this, but did not stop. From time to time he\\r\\nhummed a few of the words: \"Liberty, cherished liberty, Fight thou on\\r\\nthe side of thy defenders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove at a much quicker pace to-day, the snow being harder; and all\\r\\nthe way to Dieppe, during the long, dull hours of the journey, through\\r\\nall the jolting and rattling of the conveyance, in the falling shades of\\r\\nevening and later in the profound darkness, he continued with unabated\\r\\npersistency his vengeful and monotonous whistling; forcing his wearied\\r\\nand exasperated fellow travelers to follow the song from end to end and\\r\\nto remember every word that corresponded to each note.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Boule de Suif wept on, and at times a sob which she could not\\r\\nrepress broke out between two couplets in the darkness.',\n"," 'MISS HARRIET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were seven of us in a break, four women and three men, one of\\r\\nwhich latter was on the box seat beside the coachman, and we were\\r\\nfollowing, at a foot pace, the broad highway which serpentines along the\\r\\ncoast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting out from Etretat at break of day, in order to visit the ruins of\\r\\nTancarville, we were still asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the\\r\\nmorning. The women, especially, who were little accustomed to these\\r\\nearly excursions, let their eyelids fall and rise every moment, nodding\\r\\ntheir heads or yawning, quite insensible to the emotion of the breaking\\r\\nof day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was autumn. On both sides of the road, the bare fields stretched out,\\r\\nyellowed by the corn and wheat stubble which covered the soil, like a\\r\\nbeard that had been badly shaved. The spongy earth seemed to smoke. The\\r\\nlarks were singing, high up in the air, while other birds piped in the\\r\\nbushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun rose at length in front of us, a bright red on the plane of the\\r\\nhorizon; and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute\\r\\nto minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself,\\r\\nstretch itself, like a young girl who is leaving her bed, in her white\\r\\nvapor chemise. The Count of Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look! look! a hare!\" and he extended his arm towards the left, pointing\\r\\nto a piece of hedge. The animal threaded its way along, almost concealed\\r\\nby the field, raising only its large ears. Then it swerved across a\\r\\ndeep rut, stopped, pursued again its easy course, changed its direction,\\r\\nstopped anew, disturbed, spying out every danger, undecided as to the\\r\\nroute it should take; when suddenly it began to run with great bounds of\\r\\nthe hind legs, disappearing finally, in a large patch of beet-root. All\\r\\nthe men had woke up to watch the course of the beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené Lemanoir then exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not at all gallant this morning,\" and regarding his neighbor,\\r\\nthe little Baroness of Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he said to\\r\\nher in a subdued voice: \"You are thinking of your husband, Baroness.\\r\\nReassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you have still\\r\\nfour days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded to him with a sleepy smile: \"How rude you are.\" Then,\\r\\nshaking off her torpor, she added: \"Now, let somebody say something that\\r\\nwill make us all laugh. You, Monsieur Chenal, who have the reputation of\\r\\npossessing a larger fortune than the Duke of Richelieu, tell us a love\\r\\nstory in which you have been mixed up, anything you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very\\r\\nstrong, very proud of his physique, and very amiable, took his long\\r\\nwhite beard in his hand and smiled, then, after a few moments\\'\\r\\nreflection, he became suddenly grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale; for I am going to relate to you\\r\\nthe most lamentable love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that\\r\\nnone of my friends have ever passed through a similar experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at the time twenty-five years of age, and I was making daubs along\\r\\nthe coast of Normandy. I call \"making daubs\" that wandering about, with\\r\\na bag on one\\'s back, from mountain to mountain, under the pretext of\\r\\nstudying and of sketching nature. I know nothing more enjoyable than\\r\\nthat happy-go-lucky wandering life, in which one is perfectly free,\\r\\nwithout shackles of any kind, without care, without preoccupation,\\r\\nwithout thinking even of to-morrow. One goes in any direction one\\r\\npleases, without any guide, save his fancy, without any counselor save\\r\\nhis eyes. One pulls up, because a running brook seduces one, because one\\r\\nis attracted, in front of an inn, by the smell of potatoes frying.\\r\\nSometimes it is the perfume of clematis which decides one in his choice,\\r\\nor the naïve glance of the servant at an inn. Do not despise me for my\\r\\naffection for these rustics. These girls have a soul as well as feeling,\\r\\nnot to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips; while their hearty and\\r\\nwilling kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love always has its price,\\r\\ncome whence it may. A heart that beats when you make your appearance, an\\r\\neye that weeps when you go away, are things so rare, so sweet, so\\r\\nprecious, that they must never be despised.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had rendezvoux in ditches in which cattle repose, and in barns\\r\\namong the straw, still steaming from the heat of the day. I have\\r\\nrecollections of canvas being spread on rude and elastic benches, and of\\r\\nhearty and fresh, free kisses, more delicate and unaffectedly sincere\\r\\nthan the subtle attractions of charming and distinguished women.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what one loves most amidst all these varied adventures is the\\r\\ncountry, the woods, the risings of the sun, the twilight, the light of\\r\\nthe moon. These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with nature. One\\r\\nis alone with her in that long and tranquil rendezvous. You go to bed in\\r\\nthe fields, amidst marguerites and wild poppies, and, with eyes wide\\r\\nopen, you watch the going down of the sun, and descry in the distance\\r\\nthe little village, with its pointed clock tower, which sounds the hour\\r\\nof midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out from the foot of\\r\\nan oak, amidst a covering of fragile herbs, upright and redolent of\\r\\nlife. You go down on your knees, bend forward, you drink that cold and\\r\\npellucid water which wets your moustache and nose, you drink it with a\\r\\nphysical pleasure, as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip.\\r\\nSometimes, when you encounter a deep hole, along the course of these\\r\\ntiny brooks, you plunge into it, quite naked, and you feel on your skin,\\r\\nfrom head to foot, like an icy and delicious caress, the lovely and\\r\\ngentle quivering of the current.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are gay on the hills, melancholy on the verge of pools, exalted when\\r\\nthe sun is crowned in an ocean of blood-red shadows, and when it casts\\r\\non the rivers its red reflection. And, at night, under the moon, which\\r\\npasses across the vault of heaven, you think of things, and singular\\r\\nthings, which would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant\\r\\nlight of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, in wandering through the same country where we are this year, I came\\r\\nto the little village of Benouville, on the Falaise, between Yport and\\r\\nEtretat. I came from Fécamp, following the coast, a high coast, and as\\r\\nperpendicular as a wall, with its projecting and rugged rocks falling\\r\\nperpendicularly into the sea. I had walked since the morning on the\\r\\nshaven grass, as smooth and as yielding as a carpet. And singing\\r\\nlustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow and\\r\\nambling flight of a gull, with its short, white wings, sailing in the\\r\\nblue heavens, sometimes on the green sea, at the brown sails of a\\r\\nfishing bark. In short, I had passed a happy day, a day of listlessness\\r\\nand of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was shown a little farm house, where travelers were put up, a kind of\\r\\ninn, kept by a peasant, which stood in the center of a Norman court,\\r\\nwhich was surrounded by a double row of beeches.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuitting the Falaise, I gained the hamlet, which was hemmed in by great\\r\\ntrees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old, wrinkled and austere rustic, who seemed always to\\r\\nsuccumb to the pressure of new customs with a kind of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the month of May: the spreading apple-trees covered the court\\r\\nwith a whirling shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon\\r\\npeople and upon the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Madame Lecacheur, have you a room for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAstonished to find that I knew her name, she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That depends; everything is let; but, all the same, there will be no\\r\\nharm in looking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five minutes we were in perfect accord, and I deposited my bag upon\\r\\nthe bare floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs, a\\r\\ntable, and a wash-stand. The room looked into the large and smoky\\r\\nkitchen, where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm\\r\\nand the farmer, who was a widower.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman fricasseed a\\r\\nchicken for dinner in a large fireplace, in which hung the stew pot,\\r\\nblack with smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have travelers, then, at the present time?\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered, in an offended tone of voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a lady, an English lady, who has attained to years of maturity.\\r\\nShe is going to occupy my other room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of\\r\\ndining out in the court when the weather was fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cover was then placed in front of the door, and I commenced to gnaw\\r\\nwith my teeth the lean members of the Normandy chicken, to drink the\\r\\nclear cider, and to munch the hunk of white bread, which was four days\\r\\nold, though excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, the wooden barrier which gave into the highway, was opened,\\r\\nand a strange person directed her steps towards the house. She was very\\r\\nslender, very tall, enveloped in a Scotch shawl with red borders, and\\r\\none might have believed that she had no arms, if one had not seen a long\\r\\nhand appear just above the haunches, holding a white tourist umbrella.\\r\\nThe face of a mummy, surrounded with sausage rolls of plaited, gray\\r\\nhair, which bounded at every step she took, made me think, I know not\\r\\nwhy, of a sour herring adorned with curling papers. Lowering her eyes,\\r\\nshe passed quickly in front of me, and entered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat singular apparition made me yearn. She undoubtedly was my\\r\\nneighbor, the aged English lady of whom our hostess had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had installed\\r\\nmyself to commence painting, at the end of that beautiful valley, which\\r\\nyou know, and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, in lifting\\r\\nmy eyes suddenly, something singularly attired, standing on the crest of\\r\\nthe declivity; one might indeed say, a pole decked out with flags. It\\r\\nwas she. On seeing me, she suddenly disappeared. I re-entered the house\\r\\nat midday for lunch, and took my seat at the common table, so as to make\\r\\nthe acquaintance of this old original. But she did not respond to my\\r\\npolite advances, was insensible even to my little attentions. I poured\\r\\nwater out for her with great alacrity; I passed her the dishes with\\r\\ngreat eagerness. A slight, almost imperceptible movement of the head,\\r\\nand an English word, murmured so low that I did not understand it, were\\r\\nher only acknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ceased occupying myself with her, although she had disturbed my\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three days, I knew as much about her as did Madame\\r\\nLecacheur herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in which to\\r\\npass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville, some six months\\r\\nbefore, and did not seem disposed to quit it. She never spoke at table,\\r\\nate rapidly, reading all the while a small book, treating of some\\r\\nprotestant propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The curé\\r\\nhimself had received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to\\r\\nwhom she had paid two sous\\' commission. She said sometimes to our\\r\\nhostess, abruptly, without preparing her in the least for the\\r\\ndeclaration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love the Savior more than all; I admire him in all creation; I adore\\r\\nhim in all nature, I carry him always in my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she would immediately present the old woman with one of her\\r\\nbrochures which were destined to convert the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster had declared\\r\\nthat she was an atheist, and that a kind of reprobation weighed down on\\r\\nher. The curé, who had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner, and I\\r\\nbelieve her to be a person of pure morals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, \"Atheist,\" \"Heretic,\" words which no one can precisely\\r\\ndefine, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that\\r\\nthis English woman was rich, and that she had passed her life in\\r\\ntraveling through every country in the world, because her family had\\r\\nthrown her off. Why had her family thrown her off. Because of her\\r\\nnatural impiety?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles, one of\\r\\nthose opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many, one of\\r\\nthose good and insupportable old women who haunt the table d\\'hôtes of\\r\\nevery hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, impoison Switzerland, render the\\r\\ncharming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere\\r\\ntheir fantastic manias, their petrified vestal manners, their\\r\\nindescribable toilettes and a certain odor of India rubber, which makes\\r\\none believe that at night they slip themselves into a case of that\\r\\nmaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I encounter one of these people some fine day in a hotel, I act\\r\\nlike the birds, who see a manakin in a field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis woman, however, appeared so singular that she did not displease me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not rustic,\\r\\nfelt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic extravagances\\r\\nof the old girl. She had found a phrase by which to describe her, a\\r\\nphrase assuredly contemptible, which she had got, I know not whence,\\r\\nupon her lips, invented by I know not what confused and mysterious\\r\\ntravail of soul. She said: \"That woman is a demoniac.\" This phrase,\\r\\nculled by that austere and sentimental creature, seemed to me\\r\\nirresistibly comic. I myself, never called her now anything else, but\\r\\n\"the demoniac,\" exercising a singular pleasure in pronouncing aloud this\\r\\nword on perceiving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would ask Mother Lecacheur: \"Well, what is our demoniac about to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which my rustic friend responded, with an air of having been\\r\\nscandalized:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think, sir, she has picked up a toad which has had its paw\\r\\nbattered, and carried it to her room, and has put it in her wash-stand,\\r\\nand dressed it up like a man. If that is not profanation, I should like\\r\\nto know what is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another occasion, when walking along the Falaise, she had bought a\\r\\nlarge fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the\\r\\nsea again. The sailor, from whom she had bought it, though paid\\r\\nhandsomely, was greatly provoked at this act, more exasperated, indeed,\\r\\nthan if she had put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For a\\r\\nwhole month he could not speak of the circumstance without getting into\\r\\na fury and denouncing it as an outrage. Oh yes! She was indeed a\\r\\ndemoniac, this Miss Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an\\r\\ninspiration of genius in thus christening her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stable-boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in Africa\\r\\nin his youth, entertained other aversions. He said, with a roguish air:\\r\\n\"She is an old hag who has lived her days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the poor woman had but known!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little, kind-hearted Céleste, did not wait upon her willingly, but I\\r\\nwas never able to understand why. Probably, her only reason was that she\\r\\nwas a stranger, of another race, of a different tongue, and of another\\r\\nreligion. She was, in good truth, a demoniac!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and searching\\r\\nfor God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster of\\r\\nbushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed\\r\\naside the branches and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused\\r\\nat having been found thus, fixed on me eyes as terrible as those of a\\r\\nwild cat, surprised in open day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly descry\\r\\nher on the banks of the Falaise like a semaphore signal. She\\r\\npassionately gazed at the vast sea, glittering in the sunlight, and the\\r\\nboundless sky empurpled with fire. Sometimes I would distinguish her at\\r\\nthe bottom of a valley, walking quickly, with an English, elastic step;\\r\\nand I would go towards her, attracted I know not by what, simply to see\\r\\nher illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed\\r\\nto glow with interior and profound happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would often encounter her also in the corner of a field sitting on the\\r\\ngrass, under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little Bible lying\\r\\nopen on her knee, which she looked at meditatively at the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could no longer tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,\\r\\nbeing bound to it by a thousand links of love for its sweeping and soft\\r\\nlandscapes. At this farm I was unknown to the world, far removed from\\r\\neverything, but in close proximity to the soil, the good, healthy,\\r\\nbeautiful and green soil. And, must I avow it; there was something\\r\\nbesides curiosity which retained me at the residence of Mother\\r\\nLecacheur. I wished to become acquainted a little with this strange Miss\\r\\nHarriet, and to know what passed in the solitary souls of those\\r\\nwandering old, English dames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just finished a\\r\\nstudy, which appeared to me to display play brain power; and so it must,\\r\\nas it was sold for ten thousand francs, fifteen years later. It was as\\r\\nsimple, however, as that two and two make four, and had nothing to do\\r\\nwith academic rules. The whole of the right side of my canvas\\r\\nrepresented a rock, an enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown,\\r\\nyellow, and red, across which the sun poured like a stream of oil. The\\r\\nlight, without which one could see the stars concealed in the back\\r\\nground, fell upon the stone, and gilded it as if by fire. That was all.\\r\\nA first stupid attempt at dealing with light, burning rays, the sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea, but a\\r\\njade of a sea, as greenish, milky and thick as the overcast sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I\\r\\ncarried it back to the inn. I had wished that the whole world could have\\r\\nseen it at one and the same moment. I can remember that I showed it to a\\r\\ncow, which was browsing by the wayside, exclaiming at the same time:\\r\\n\"Look at that, my old beauty, you shall not often see its like again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the front of the house, I immediately called out to\\r\\nMother Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ohè! Ohè! my mistress, come here and look at this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rustic advanced and regarded my work with her stupid eyes which\\r\\ndistinguished nothing, and which did not even recognize whether the\\r\\npicture was the representation of an ox or a house.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet returned to the house, and she passed in rear of me just at\\r\\nthe moment when, holding out my canvas at arm\\'s length, I was exhibiting\\r\\nit to the female innkeeper. The demoniac could not help but see it, for\\r\\nI took care to exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape\\r\\nher notice. She stopped abruptly and stood motionless, stupefied. It was\\r\\nher rock which was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her\\r\\ntime undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a British \"Aoh,\" which was at once so accentuated and so\\r\\nflattering, that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my last work, Mademoiselle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe murmured ecstatically, comically and tenderly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Monsieur, you must understand what it is to have a palpitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI colored up, of course, and was more excited by that compliment than if\\r\\nit had come from a queen. I was seduced, conquered, vanquished. I could\\r\\nhave embraced her; upon my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a seat at the table beside her, as I had always done. For the\\r\\nfirst time, she spoke, drawling out in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I love nature so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI offered her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted these\\r\\nwith the vacant smile of a mummy. I then began to converse with her\\r\\nabout the scenery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the meal, we rose from the table together and we walked leisurely\\r\\nacross the court; then, being attracted by the fiery glow which the\\r\\nsetting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the outside gate\\r\\nwhich opened in the direction of the Falaise, and we walked on side by\\r\\nside, as satisfied as any two persons could be, who have just learned to\\r\\nunderstand and penetrate each other\\'s motives and feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a muggy, relaxing evening, one of those enjoyable evenings, which\\r\\nimpart happiness to mind and body alike. All is joy, all is charm. The\\r\\nluscious and balmy air, loaded with the perfumes of herbs, the perfumes\\r\\nof grass-wrack, which caresses the odor of the wild flowers, caresses\\r\\nthe potato with its marine flavor, caresses the soul with a penetrating\\r\\nsweetness. We were going to the brink of the abyss, which overlooked\\r\\nthe vast sea, and which rolled past us at the distance of less than a\\r\\nhundred meters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we drank with open mouth and expanded chest that fresh breath which\\r\\ncame from the ocean and which glided slowly over the skin, salted by its\\r\\nlong contact with the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrapped up in her square shawl, inspired by the balmy air and with teeth\\r\\nfirmly set, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball, as it\\r\\ndescended towards the sea. Soon its rim touched the waters, just in rear\\r\\nof a ship which appeared on the horizon, until, by degrees, it was\\r\\nswallowed up by the ocean. It was seen to plunge, diminish, and finally\\r\\nto disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet contemplated with a passionate regard the last glimmer of\\r\\nthe flaming orb of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe muttered: \"Aoh! I loved ... I loved ...\" I saw a tear start in her\\r\\neye. She continued: \"I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount\\r\\nup into the firmament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on the\\r\\nriver\\'s banks, her face as red as her purple shawl. I should have liked\\r\\nto have sketched her in my album. It would have been an ecstatic\\r\\ncaricature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned my face away from her so as to be able to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then spoke to her of painting, as I would have done to a fellow\\r\\nartist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the\\r\\nprofession. She listened attentively to me, eagerly seeking to define\\r\\nthe sense of the obscure words, so as to penetrate my thoughts. From\\r\\ntime to time, she would exclaim: \"Oh! I understand, I understand. This\\r\\nhas been very interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, on seeing me, she approached me eagerly, holding out her\\r\\nhand; and we became firm friends immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a brave creature who had a kind of elastic soul, which became\\r\\nenthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium, like all women who are\\r\\nspinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be pickled in vinegar\\r\\ninnocence, though her heart still retained something of youth and of\\r\\ngirlish effervescence. She loved both nature and animals with a fervent\\r\\nardor, a love like old wine, fermented through age, with a sensual love\\r\\nthat she had never bestowed on men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is certain, that a bitch in pup, a mare roaming in a meadow\\r\\nwith a foal at its side, a bird\\'s nest full of young ones, squeaking,\\r\\nwith their open mouths and enormous heads, made her quiver with the most\\r\\nviolent emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor solitary beings! Tristias and wanderers from table d\\'hôte to table\\r\\nd\\'hôte, poor beings, ridiculous and lamentable. I love you ever since I\\r\\nbecame acquainted with Miss Harriet!\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me, but\\r\\nshe dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in\\r\\nthe morning with my box on my back, she accompanied me as far as the end\\r\\nof the village, silent, but evidently struggling inwardly to find words\\r\\nwith which to begin a conversation. Then she left me abruptly, and, with\\r\\na jaunty step, walked away quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, however, she plucked up courage:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would like to see how you paint pictures? Will you? I have been very\\r\\ncurious.\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she colored up as though she had given utterance to words extremely\\r\\naudacious.\\r\\n\\r\\nI conducted her to the bottom of the Petit-Val, where I had commenced a\\r\\nlarge picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing near me, following all my gestures with\\r\\nconcentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing, perhaps, that she was\\r\\ndisturbing me she said to me: \"Thank you,\" and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a short time she became more familiar, and accompanied me every\\r\\nday, her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her\\r\\nfolding stool under her arm, and would not consent to my carrying it,\\r\\nand she sat always by my side. She would remain there for hours,\\r\\nimmovable and mute, following with her eye the point of my brush, in its\\r\\nevery movement. When I would obtain, by a large splatch of color spread\\r\\non with a knife, a striking and unexpected effect, she would, in spite\\r\\nof herself, give vent to a half-suppressed \"Ah!\" of astonishment, of\\r\\njoy, of admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an\\r\\nalmost religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of\\r\\nnature\\'s work divine. My studies appeared to her as a kind of pictures\\r\\nof sanctity, and sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of\\r\\nconverting me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! He was a queer good-natured being, this God of hers. He was a sort\\r\\nof village philosopher without any great resources, and without great\\r\\npower; for she always figured him to herself as a being quivering over\\r\\ninjustices committed under his eyes, and as though he was helpless to\\r\\nprevent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be the\\r\\nconfidant of his secrets and of his contrarieties. She said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God wills, or God does not will,\" just like a sergeant announcing to a\\r\\nrecruit: \"The colonel has commanded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of her heart, she deplored my ignorance of the intentions\\r\\nof the Eternal, which she strove, and felt herself compelled to impart\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every day, I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it from\\r\\nthe ground, in my box of colors, in my polished shoes, standing in the\\r\\nmornings in front of my door, those little pious brochures, which she,\\r\\nno doubt, received directly from Paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected cordiality.\\r\\nBut I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her manner; but,\\r\\nfor a while, I paid little attention to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I walked about, whether to the bottom of the valley, or through\\r\\nsome country lanes, I would see her suddenly appear, as though she were\\r\\nreturning from a rapid walk. She would then sit down abruptly, out of\\r\\nbreath, as though she had been running, or overcome by some profound\\r\\nemotion. Her face would be red, that English red which is denied to the\\r\\npeople of all other countries; then, without any reason, she would grow\\r\\npale, become the color of the ground and seem ready to faint away.\\r\\nGradually, however, I would see her regain her ordinary color, whereupon\\r\\nshe would begin to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a sentence,\\r\\nspring up from her seat, and march off so rapidly and so strangely, that\\r\\nit would, sometimes, put me to my wits ends to try and discover whether\\r\\nI had done or said anything to displease or offend her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finally came to the conclusion that this arose from her early habits\\r\\nand training, somewhat modified, no doubt, in honor of me, since the\\r\\nfirst days of our acquaintanceship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the\\r\\nwind-beaten coast, her long curled hair would be shaken out and hanging\\r\\nloose, as though it had broken away from its bearings. It was seldom\\r\\nthat this gave her any concern; looking sometimes as though she had just\\r\\nreturned from dining _sans cèremonie_; her locks having become\\r\\ndishevelled by the breezes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would then go up to her room in order to adjust what I called her\\r\\nglass lamps; and when I would say to her, in the familiar gallantry,\\r\\nwhich, however, always offended her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are as beautiful as a planet to-day, Miss Harriet,\" a little blood\\r\\nwould immediately mount into her cheeks, the blood of a young maiden,\\r\\nthe blood of sweet fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she would become abruptly savage and cease coming to watch me\\r\\npaint. I thought thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is only a fit of temper she is passing through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it did not always pass away. When I spoke to her sometimes, she\\r\\nwould answer me, either with an air of affected indifference, or in\\r\\nsullen anger; and became by turns rude, impatient, and nervous. For a\\r\\ntime I never saw her except at meals, and we spoke but little. I\\r\\nconcluded, at length, that I must have offended her in something: and,\\r\\naccordingly, I said to her one evening:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act towards me as formerly?\\r\\nWhat have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded, in an angry tone, in a manner altogether _sui generis_:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I be always with you the same as formerly.[4] It is not true, not\\r\\ntrue,\" and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt times she would look upon me with strange eyes. Since that time I\\r\\nhave often said to myself that those who are condemned to death must\\r\\nlook thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her\\r\\neye there lurked a species of folly, a folly at once mysterious and\\r\\nviolent; and even more; a fever, an exasperated desire, impatient, and\\r\\nat once incapable of being realized and unrealizable!\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, it seemed to me that there was also going on within her a combat,\\r\\nin which her heart struggled against an unknown force that she wished to\\r\\novercome, and even, perhaps, something else. But what could I know? What\\r\\ncould I know?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed a singular revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight appeared, on\\r\\na picture, the subject of which was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nA deep ravine, steep banks, dominated by two declivities, lined with\\r\\nbrambles and long rows of trees, hidden, drowned in that milky vapor,\\r\\nclad in that musty robe which sometimes floats over valleys, at break of\\r\\nday. And at the extreme end of that thick and transparent fog, you see\\r\\ncoming or, rather already come, a human couple, a stripling and a\\r\\nmaiden, embraced, inter-laced, she, with head leaning on him, he,\\r\\ninclined towards her, and lips to lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first ray of the sun glistening through the branches, has traversed\\r\\nthat fog of the dawn, has illuminated it with a rosy reflection, just\\r\\nbehind the rustic lovers, on which can be seen their vague shadows in a\\r\\nclear silver. It was well done, yes, indeed, well done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working on the declivity which led to the Val d\\'Etretat. This\\r\\nparticular morning, I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor, which\\r\\nwas necessary for my purpose. Suddenly, an object appeared in front of\\r\\nme, a kind of phantom; it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me, she took to\\r\\nflight. But I called after her saying: \"Come here, come here,\\r\\nMademoiselle, I have a nice little picture for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my\\r\\nsketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless,\\r\\nregarding it; and, suddenly, she burst into tears. She wept\\r\\nspasmodically, like men who have been struggling hard against shedding\\r\\ntears, but who can do so no longer, and abandon themselves to grief,\\r\\nthough still resisting. I got up, trembling, moved myself by the sight\\r\\nof a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her by the hand with an\\r\\nimpulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse which impels one\\r\\nquicker than one thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them quiver\\r\\nas if her whole nervous system was twisting and turning. Then she\\r\\nwithdrew her hands abruptly, or, rather tore them out of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized that shiver, as soon as I had felt it; I was deceived in\\r\\nnothing. Ah! the live shiver of a woman, whether she is fifteen or fifty\\r\\nyears of age, whether she is one of the people or one of the _monde_,\\r\\ngoes so straight to my heart that I never had any compunctions in\\r\\nunderstanding it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer whole frail being trembled, vibrated, swooned. I knew it. She walked\\r\\naway before I had time to say a word, leaving me as surprised as if I\\r\\nhad witnessed a miracle, and as troubled as if I had committed a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not go in to breakfast. I went to make a tour on the banks of the\\r\\nFalaise, feeling that I would just as lieve weep as laugh, looking on\\r\\nthe adventure as both comic and deplorable, and my position as\\r\\nridiculous, fain to believe that I had lost my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked myself what I ought to do. I debated with myself whether I ought\\r\\nto take my leave of the place and almost immediately my resolution was\\r\\nformed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time, and I\\r\\nentered the farm house just when the soup had been served up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down at the table, as usual. Miss Harriet was there, munching away\\r\\nsolemnly, without speaking to anyone, without even lifting eyes. She\\r\\nwore, however, her usual expression, both of countenance and manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited, patiently, till the meal had been finished, when, turning\\r\\ntowards the landlady I said: \"See here, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be\\r\\nlong now before I shall have to take my leave of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in a quivering\\r\\nvoice: \"My dear sir, what is it I have just heard you say? you are going\\r\\nto leave us, after I have become so much accustomed to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI regarded Miss Harriet from the corner of my eye. Her countenance did\\r\\nnot change in the least; but the under-servant came towards me with eyes\\r\\nwide open. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,\\r\\nfresh, as strong as a horse, yet possessing the rare attribute in one in\\r\\nher position--she was very neat and clean. I had embraced her at odd\\r\\ntimes, in out of the way corners, in the manner of a mountain guide,\\r\\nnothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the apple\\r\\ntrees, walking up and down at my ease, from one end of the court to the\\r\\nother. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange\\r\\ndiscovery of the morning, that grotesque love and passionate attachment\\r\\nfor me, the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,\\r\\nrecollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps, also, that look\\r\\nwhich the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my\\r\\ndeparture--all these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a\\r\\njolly humor of body, recalling the tickling sensation of kisses on the\\r\\nlips, and in the veins, something which urged me on to commit some\\r\\nfolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight having come on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, I\\r\\ndescried Céleste, who had gone to shut the hen coops, at the other end\\r\\nof the enclosure. I darted towards her, running so noiselessly that she\\r\\nheard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small traps by which\\r\\nthe chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained on her\\r\\ncoarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She made a struggle, laughing all\\r\\nthe same, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Wherefore\\r\\ndid I suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a\\r\\nshock? What was it that I heard behind me?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Miss Harriet who had come upon us, who had seen us, and who stood\\r\\nin front of us, as motionless as a specter. Then she disappeared in the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been surprised by\\r\\nher than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly that night; I was completely enervated and haunted by sad\\r\\nthoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping; but in this I was no doubt\\r\\ndeceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one\\r\\nwalking up and down in the house, and who had opened my door from the\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards morning, I was overcome by fatigue and sleep seized on me. I got\\r\\nup late and did not go downstairs until breakfast time, being still in a\\r\\nbewildered state, not knowing what kind of face to put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she did\\r\\nnot appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English\\r\\nwoman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was\\r\\nwont to do, in order to see the sun rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody seemed astonished at this and we began to eat in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was hot, very hot, one of those still, boiling days, when\\r\\nnot a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an apple\\r\\ntree; and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a jug\\r\\nof cider, everybody was so thirsty. Céleste brought the dishes from the\\r\\nkitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.\\r\\nAfterwards she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the\\r\\nseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wanted to wash and refresh these, I begged the servant to go and\\r\\nbring a pitcher of cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was dry. She\\r\\nhad lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord, and had touched\\r\\nthe bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again, it was empty. Mother\\r\\nLecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and looked\\r\\ndown the hole. She returned announcing that one could see clearly\\r\\nsomething in the well, something altogether unusual. But this, no doubt,\\r\\nwas pottles of straw, which, out of spite, had been cast down it by a\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wished also to look down the well, hoping I would be able to clear up\\r\\nthe mystery, and perched myself close to its brink. I perceived,\\r\\nindistinctly, a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the\\r\\nidea of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so, the\\r\\nyellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer.\\r\\nAll the four of us were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Céleste\\r\\nhaving now joined us. The lantern rested on a black and white,\\r\\nindistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have escaped from the meadow,\\r\\nduring the night, and fallen in headlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, suddenly, a cold shiver attacked my spine, I first recognized a\\r\\nfoot, then a clothed limb; the body was entire, but the other limb had\\r\\ndisappeared under the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned and trembled so violently that the light of the lamp danced\\r\\nhither and thither over the object, discovering a slipper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a woman! who ... who ... can it be? It is Miss Harriet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur alone did not manifest horror. He had witnessed many such scenes\\r\\nin Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste began to scream and to shriek, and ran\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead. I attached the\\r\\nvalet securely by the loins to the end of the pulley-rope, and I lowered\\r\\nhim slowly, and watched him disappear in the darkness. In the one hand\\r\\nhe had a lantern, and held on by the rope with the other. Soon I\\r\\nrecognized his voice, which seemed to come from the center of the earth,\\r\\ncrying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other limb.\\r\\nHe then bound the two feet together, and shouted anew:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haul up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI commenced to wind him up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,\\r\\nand I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When\\r\\nhis head appeared at the brink, I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\" as though I only expected that he would inform me of\\r\\nwhat he had discovered at the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both got on to the stone slab at the edge of the well, and, face to\\r\\nface, we hoisted the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste watched us from a distance, concealed from\\r\\nview behind the wall of the house. When they saw, issuing from the hole,\\r\\nthe black slippers and the white stockings of the drowned person, they\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur seized the ankles of the poor chaste woman, and we drew it up,\\r\\nsloping, as it was, in the most immodest posture. The head was shocking\\r\\nto look at, being bruised and black; and the long, gray hair, hanging\\r\\ndown tangled and disordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of all that is holy, how lean she is!\" exclaimed Sapeur, in\\r\\na contemptuous tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an\\r\\nappearance, I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse\\r\\nfor burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed her disfigured face. To the touch of my hand, an eye was\\r\\nslightly opened, which regarded me with that pale regard, with that cold\\r\\nlook, with that terrible look that corpses have, which seemed to come\\r\\nfrom beyond life. I plaited up, as well as I could, her disheveled hair,\\r\\nand I adjusted on her forehead, a novel and singularly formed lock. Then\\r\\nI took off her dripping wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of\\r\\nshame, as though I had been guilty of some profanation, her shoulders\\r\\nand her chest, and her long arms, as slim as the twigs of branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI next went to fetch some flowers, corn poppies, blue beetles,\\r\\nmarguerites, and fresh and perfumed herbs, with which to strew her\\r\\nfuneral couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI being the only person near her, it was necessary for me to perform the\\r\\nusual ceremonies. In a letter found in her pocket, written at the last\\r\\nmoment, it was ordered that her body was to be buried in the village in\\r\\nwhich she had passed the last days of her life. A frightful thought then\\r\\npressed on my heart. Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid\\r\\nto rest in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the evening, all the female gossips of the locality came to view\\r\\nthe remains of the defunct; but I would not allow a single person to\\r\\nenter; I wanted to be alone; and I watched by the corpse the whole\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the corpse by the flickering lights of the candles, this\\r\\nmiserable woman, wholly unknown, who had died lamentably and so far away\\r\\nfrom home. Had she left no friends, no relations behind her? What had\\r\\nher infancy been? What had been her life? Whence had she hailed thither\\r\\nthus, all alone, wanderer, lost like a dog driven from its home? What\\r\\nsecrets of sufferings and despair were sealed up in that disagreeable\\r\\nbody, in that spent, tarnished body--tarnished during the whole of its\\r\\nexistence, that impenetrable envelope which had driven her far away from\\r\\nall affection, from all love?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon that\\r\\nhuman creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all\\r\\nover with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which\\r\\nsustains the greatest outcasts--to wit, the hope of being loved for\\r\\nonce! Otherwise, why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from\\r\\nthe face of the others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so\\r\\npassionately, everything living that was not a man?\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized, also, that she believed in a God, and that she hoped to\\r\\nreceive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had\\r\\nendured. She had begun now to decompose, and to become, in turn, a\\r\\nplant. She who had blossomed in the sun, was now to be eaten up by the\\r\\ncattle, carried away in seeds, and flesh of beasts, would become again\\r\\nhuman flesh. But that which is called the soul, had been extinguished at\\r\\nthe bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She had changed\\r\\nher life for that of others yet to be born.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the dead. A\\r\\npale light at length announced the dawn of a new day, when a bright ray\\r\\nglistened on the bed, shed a dash of fire on the bed clothes and on her\\r\\nhands. This was the hour she had so much loved, when the awakened birds\\r\\nbegan to sing in the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened the window to its fullest extent, I drew back the curtains, so\\r\\nthat the whole heavens might look in upon us, and bending towards the\\r\\nglassy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head; then, slowly,\\r\\nwithout terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those\\r\\nlips, which had never before received any.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat\\r\\nthe Count d\\'Etraille, who blows his nose, from time to time. The\\r\\ncoachman alone had gone to sleep. The horses, which felt no longer the\\r\\nsting of the whip, had slowed their pace and dragged along softly, and\\r\\nthe brake, hardly advancing at all, became suddenly torpid, as if it had\\r\\nbeen charged with sorrow.',\n"," 'FRANCESCA AND CARLOTTA RONDOLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nNo (said my friend Charles Jouvent), I do not know Italy; I started to\\r\\nsee it thoroughly twice, and each time I was stopped at the frontier and\\r\\ncould not manage to get any further. And yet my two attempts gave me a\\r\\ncharming idea of the manners of that beautiful country. I must, however,\\r\\nsome time or other visit its cities, as well as the museums and works of\\r\\nart with which it abounds. I will also make another attempt to penetrate\\r\\ninto the interior, which I have not yet succeeded in doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\\'t understand me, so I will explain myself: In the spring of 1874\\r\\nI was seized with an irresistible desire to see Venice, Florence, Rome,\\r\\nand Naples. I am, as you know, not a great traveler; it appears to me a\\r\\nuseless and fatiguing business. Nights spent in a train, the disturbed\\r\\nslumbers of the railway carriage, with the attendant headache, and\\r\\nstiffness in every limb, the sudden waking in that rolling box, the\\r\\nunwashed feeling with your eyes and hair full of dust, the smell of the\\r\\ncoal on which one\\'s lungs feed, those bad dinners in the draughty\\r\\nrefreshment rooms are, according to my ideas, a horrible way of\\r\\nbeginning a pleasure trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this introduction by the express, we have the miseries of the\\r\\nhotel; of some great hotel full of people, and yet so empty; the strange\\r\\nroom, and the dubious bed! I am most particular about my bed; it is the\\r\\nsanctuary of life. We intrust our almost naked and fatigued bodies to it\\r\\nso that they may be reanimated by reposing between soft sheets and\\r\\nfeathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere we find the most delightful hours of our existence, the hours of\\r\\nlove and of sleep. The bed is sacred, and should be respected,\\r\\nvenerated, and loved by us as the best and most delightful of our\\r\\nearthly possessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot lift up the sheets of an hotel bed without a shiver of disgust.\\r\\nWhat have its occupants been doing in it the night before? Perhaps\\r\\ndirty, revolting people have slept in it. I begin, then, to think of all\\r\\nthe horrible people with whom one rubs shoulders every day, people with\\r\\nsuspicious-looking skin which makes one think of the feet and all the\\r\\nrest! I call to mind those who carry about with them the sickening smell\\r\\nof garlic or of humanity. I think of those who are deformed and\\r\\npurulent, of the perspiration emanating from the sick, and of everything\\r\\nthat is ugly and filthy in man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this, perhaps, in the bed in which I am going to sleep! The mere\\r\\nidea of it makes me feel ill as I get in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the hotel dinners--those dreary _table d\\'hôte_ dinners in the\\r\\nmidst of all sorts of extraordinary people, or else those terrible\\r\\nsolitary dinners at a small table in a restaurant, feebly lighted up by\\r\\na wretched composite candle under a shade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, those terribly dull evenings in some unknown town! Do you know\\r\\nanything more wretched than when it is getting dark on such an occasion?\\r\\nOne goes about as if almost in a dream, looking at faces which one has\\r\\nnever seen before and will never see again; listening to people talking\\r\\nabout matters which are quite indifferent to you in a language that\\r\\nperhaps you do not understand. You have a terrible feeling, almost as if\\r\\nyou were lost, and you continue to walk on so as not to be obliged to\\r\\nreturn to the hotel, where you would feel more lost still because you\\r\\nare _at home_, in a home which belongs to anyone who can pay for it, and\\r\\nat last you fall into a chair of some well-lit café, whose gilding and\\r\\nlights overwhelm you a thousand times more than the shadows in the\\r\\nstreets. Then you feel so abominably lonely sitting in front of the\\r\\nglass of flat _bock_,[5] that a kind of madness seizes you, the longing\\r\\nto go somewhere or other, no matter where, as long as you need not\\r\\nremain in front of that marble table and in the dazzling brightness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, suddenly, you perceive that you are really alone in the world,\\r\\nalways and everywhere; but that in places which we know the familiar\\r\\njostlings give us the illusion only of human fraternity. At such moments\\r\\nof self-abandonment and somber isolation in distant cities one thinks\\r\\nbroadly, clearly, and profoundly. Then one suddenly sees the whole of\\r\\nlife outside the vision of eternal hope, outside the deceptions of our\\r\\ninnate habits, and of our expectations of happiness, of which we indulge\\r\\nin dreams never to be realized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only by going a long distance that we can fully understand how\\r\\nshort-lived and empty everything near at hand is; by searching for the\\r\\nunknown we perceive how commonplace and evanescent everything is; only\\r\\nby wandering over the face of the earth can we understand how small the\\r\\nworld is, and how very much alike everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow well I know, and how I hate and almost fear those haphazard walks\\r\\nthrough unknown streets; and this was the reason why, as nothing would\\r\\ninduce me to undertake a tour in Italy by myself, I made up my mind to\\r\\naccompany my friend Paul Pavilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know Paul, and how woman is everything, the world, life itself, to\\r\\nhim. There are many men like that, to whom existence becomes poetical\\r\\nand idealized by the presence of women. The earth is inhabitable only\\r\\nbecause they are there; the sun shines and is warm because it lights\\r\\nupon them; the air is soft and balmy because it blows upon their skin\\r\\nand ruffles the short hairs on their temples, and the moon is charming\\r\\nbecause it makes them dream and imparts a languorous charm to love.\\r\\nEvery act and action of Paul\\'s has woman for its motive; all his\\r\\nthoughts, all his efforts and hopes are centered on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I mentioned Italy to Paul he at first absolutely refused to leave\\r\\nParis. I, however, began to tell him of the adventures I had on my\\r\\ntravels. I assured him that all Italian women are charming, and I made\\r\\nhim hope for the most refined pleasures at Naples, thanks to certain\\r\\nletters of introduction which I had; and so at last he allowed himself\\r\\nto be persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the express one Thursday evening, Paul and I. Hardly anyone goes\\r\\nSouth at that time of the year, so that we had the carriage to\\r\\nourselves, and both of us were in a bad temper on leaving Paris, sorry\\r\\nfor having yielded to the temptation of this journey, and regretting\\r\\nMarly, the Seine, and our lazy boating excursions, and all those\\r\\npleasures in and near Paris which are so dear to every true Parisian.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the train started Paul stuck himself into his corner, and\\r\\nsaid, \"It is most idiotic to go all that way,\" and as it was too late\\r\\nfor him to change his mind then, I said, \"Well, you should not have\\r\\ncome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me no answer, and I felt very much inclined to laugh when I saw\\r\\nhow furious he looked. He is certainly always rather like a squirrel,\\r\\nbut then every one of us has retained the type of some animal or other\\r\\nas the mark of his primitive race. How many people have jaws like a\\r\\nbull-dog, or heads like goats, rabbits, foxes, horses, or oxen. Paul is\\r\\na squirrel turned into a man. He has its bright, quick eyes, its old\\r\\nhair, pointed nose, its small, fine, supple, active body, and a certain\\r\\nmysterious resemblance in his general bearing: in fact, a similarity of\\r\\nmovements, of gestures, and of bearing which might almost be taken for a\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we both went to sleep with that uncomfortable slumber of the\\r\\nrailway carriage, which is interrupted by horrible cramps in the arms\\r\\nand neck, and by the sudden stoppages of the train.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe woke up as we were going along the Rhone. Soon the continued noise of\\r\\nthe grasshoppers came in through the window, that cry which seems to be\\r\\nthe voice of the warm earth, the song of Provence; and seemed to instill\\r\\ninto our looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling\\r\\nof the South, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light\\r\\nsoil of the olive, with its gray-green foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train stopped again a railway servant ran along the train\\r\\ncalling out \"Valence\" in a sonorous voice, with an accent that again\\r\\ngave us a taste of that Provence which the shrill note of the\\r\\ngrasshoppers had already imparted to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing new happened until we got to Marseilles, where we got out to\\r\\nbreakfast, but when we returned to our carriage we found a woman\\r\\ninstalled there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, with a delightful look at me, gave his short moustache a\\r\\nmechanical twirl, and passed his fingers through his hair, which had\\r\\nbecome slightly out of order with the night\\'s journey. Then he sat down\\r\\nopposite the newcomer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I happen to see a striking new face, either while traveling or\\r\\nin society, I always have the strongest inclination to find out what\\r\\ncharacter, mind, and intellectual capacities are hidden beneath those\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a young and pretty woman, a native of the South of France\\r\\ncertainly, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so\\r\\nthick, long, and strong that it seemed almost too heavy for her head.\\r\\nShe was dressed with a certain Southern elegant bad taste which made her\\r\\nlook a little vulgar. Her regular features had none of the grace and\\r\\nfinish of the refined races, of that slight delicacy which members of\\r\\nthe aristocracy inherit from their birth, and which is the hereditary\\r\\nmark of thinner blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer bracelets were too big to be of gold; she wore earrings with large\\r\\nwhite stones which were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged\\r\\nunmistakably to the commonalty. One would have guessed that she would\\r\\ntalk too loud, and shout on every occasion with exaggerated gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train started she remained motionless in her place, in the\\r\\nattitude of a woman who was in a rage, without even looking at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul began to talk to me, evidently with an eye to effect, trying to\\r\\nattract her attention, like shopkeepers who expose their choice wares to\\r\\ncatch the notice of passers-by.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe, however, did not appear to be paying the least attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toulon! Ten minutes to wait! Refreshment room!\" the porters shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul motioned to me to get out, and as soon as we had done so, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder who on earth she can be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to laugh. \"I am sure I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t the least care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was quite excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is an uncommonly fresh and pretty girl. What eyes she has, and how\\r\\ncross she looks. She must have been dreadfully worried, for she takes no\\r\\nnotice of anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have all your trouble for nothing,\" I growled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to lose his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not taking any trouble, my dear fellow. I think her an extremely\\r\\npretty woman, that is all. If one could only speak to her! But I don\\'t\\r\\nknow how to begin. Cannot you give me an idea? Can\\'t you guess who she\\r\\nis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot. However, I should rather think she is some\\r\\nstrolling actress who is going to rejoin her company after a love\\r\\nadventure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed quite upset, as if I had said something insulting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What makes you think that? On the contrary, I think she looks most\\r\\nrespectable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look at her bracelets,\" I said, \"her earrings and her whole dress.\\r\\nI should not be the least surprised if she were a dancer or a circus\\r\\nrider, but most likely a dancer. Her whole style smacks very much of the\\r\\ntheater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe evidently did not like the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is much too young, I am sure; why, she is hardly twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"there are many things which one can do before one is\\r\\ntwenty; dancing and reciting are among them, without counting another\\r\\nlittle business which is, perhaps, her sole occupation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take your seats for Nice, Vintimiglia,\" the guards and porters called\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got in; our fellow passenger was eating an orange, and certainly she\\r\\ndid not do it elegantly. She had spread her pocket-handkerchief on her\\r\\nknees, and the way in which she tore off the peel and opened her mouth\\r\\nto put in the figs, and then spat the pips out of the window, showed\\r\\nthat her education had been decidedly vulgar.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed, also, more put out than ever, and swallowed the fruit with\\r\\nan exceedingly comic air of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul devoured her with his eyes, and tried to attract her attention and\\r\\nexcite her curiosity, but in spite of his talk and of the manner in\\r\\nwhich he brought in well-known names, she did not pay the least\\r\\nattention to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passing Fréjus and St. Raphael, the train passed through a\\r\\nveritable garden, a paradise of roses, and groves of oranges and lemons\\r\\ncovered with fruit and flowers at the same time. That delightful coast\\r\\nfrom Marseilles to Genoa is a kingdom of perfumes in a home of flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune is the time to see it in all its beauty, when in every narrow\\r\\nvalley and on every slope, the most exquisite flowers are growing\\r\\nluxuriantly. And the roses! fields, hedges, groves of roses. They climb\\r\\nup the walls, blossom on the roofs, hang from the trees, peep out from\\r\\namong the bushes; they are white, red, yellow, large and small, single,\\r\\nwith a simple self-colored dress, or full and heavy in brilliant\\r\\ntoilets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir continual breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, while the still\\r\\nmore penetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere\\r\\ntill it might almost be called the sugar-plum of the smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless\\r\\nMediterranean. The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the\\r\\nmountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the hard, fixed blue\\r\\nsea. The train went on, through the tunnels, along the slopes, above the\\r\\nwater, on straight, wall-like viaducts, and a soft, vague, saltish\\r\\nsmell, a smell of drying seaweed, mingled at times with the strong,\\r\\nheavy perfume of the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul neither saw, looked at, nor smelled anything, for our fellow\\r\\ntraveler engrossed all his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got to Cannes, as he wished to speak to me he signed to me to\\r\\nget out again, and as soon as I had done so he took me by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, she is really charming. Just look at her eyes; and I never\\r\\nsaw anything like her hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t excite yourself,\" I replied, \"or else tackle her, if you have any\\r\\nintentions that way. She does not look impregnable, I fancy, although\\r\\nshe appears to be a little bit grumpy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you speak to her?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say, for I am always terribly stupid at first; I\\r\\ncan never make advances to a woman in the street. I follow them, go\\r\\nround and round them, and quite closely to them, but I never know what\\r\\nto say at first. I only once tried to enter into conversation with a\\r\\nwoman in that way. As I clearly saw that she was waiting for me to make\\r\\novertures, and as I felt bound to say something, I stammered out, \\'I\\r\\nhope you are quite well, madam?\\' She laughed in my face, and I made my\\r\\nescape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised Paul to do all I could to bring about a conversation, and\\r\\nwhen we had taken our places again, I politely asked our neighbor:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any objection to the smell of tobacco, madam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe merely replied, \"_Non capisco_.\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she was Italian! I felt an absurd inclination to laugh. As Paul did\\r\\nnot understand a word of that language, I was obliged to act as his\\r\\ninterpreter, so I said in Italian:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked you, madam, whether you had any objection to tobacco smoke?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an angry look she replied, \"_Che mi fa_.\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had neither turned her head nor looked at me, and I really did not\\r\\nknow whether to take this \"What does it matter to me\" for an\\r\\nauthorization, a refusal, a real sign of indifference, or for a mere\\r\\n\"Leave me alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame,\" I replied, \"if you mind the smell of tobacco in the least--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe again said, \"_Mica_,\"[8] in a tone of voice which seemed to mean, \"I\\r\\nwish to goodness you would leave me alone!\" It was, however, a kind of\\r\\npermission, so I said to Paul:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can smoke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me in that curious sort of way that people have when they\\r\\ntry to understand others who are talking in a strange language before\\r\\nthem, and asked me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked if we might smoke, and she said we might do whatever we liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon I lighted my cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did she not say anything more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had counted her words you would have noticed that she used\\r\\nexactly six, two of which gave me to understand that she knew no French,\\r\\nso four remained, and a lot can be said in four words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul seemed quite unhappy, disappointed, and \"at sea,\" so to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly the Italian asked me, in that tone of discontent which\\r\\nseemed habitual to her, \"Do you know at what time we shall get to\\r\\nGenoa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock,\" I replied. Then after a moment I went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friend and I are also going to Genoa, and if we can be of any\\r\\nservice to you, we shall be very happy, as you are quite alone.\" But she\\r\\ninterrupted with such a \"_Mica_\" that I did not venture on another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She said that she thought you were charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was in no humor for joking, and begged me, dryly, not to make\\r\\nfun of him, so I translated her question and my polite offer, which had\\r\\nbeen so rudely rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he really became as agitated as a squirrel in a cage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we only knew,\" he said, \"what hotel she was going to, we would go to\\r\\nthe same. Try and find out, so as to have another opportunity for making\\r\\nher speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not particularly easy, and I did not know what pretext to invent,\\r\\nanxious as I was to make the acquaintance of this unapproachable person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed Nice, Monaco, Mentone, and the train stopped at the frontier\\r\\nfor the examination of luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I hate those badly brought-up people who breakfast and dine in\\r\\nrailway-carriages, I went and bought a quantity of good things to make\\r\\none last attack on her by their means. I felt sure that this girl must,\\r\\nordinarily, be by no means inaccessible. Something had put her out and\\r\\nmade her irritable, but very little would suffice, a mere word or some\\r\\nagreeable offer, to decide her and overcome her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started again, and we three were still alone. I spread my eatables\\r\\nout on the seat. I cut up the fowl, put the slices of ham neatly on a\\r\\npiece of paper, and then carefully laid out our dessert, the\\r\\nstrawberries, plums, cherries, and cakes, close to the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she saw that we were going to eat she took a piece of chocolate and\\r\\ntwo little crisp cakes out of her pocket and began to munch them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask her to have some of ours,\" Paul said in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I want to do, but it is rather a difficult\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she, however, glanced from time to time at our provisions, I felt\\r\\nsure that she would still be hungry when she had finished what she had,\\r\\nso as soon as her frugal meal was over, I said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be very kind of you if you would take some of this fruit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she said \"_Mica_,\" but less crossly than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"may I offer you a little wine? I see you have not\\r\\ndrunk anything. It is Italian wine, and as we are now in your own\\r\\ncountry, we should be very pleased to see such a pretty Italian mouth\\r\\naccept the offer of its French neighbors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head slightly, evidently wishing to refuse, but very\\r\\ndesirous of accepting, and her mica _this_ time was almost polite. I\\r\\ntook the bottle, which was covered with straw in the Italian fashion,\\r\\nand filling the glass I offered it to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please drink it,\" I said, \"to bid us welcome to your country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the glass with her usual look, and emptied it at a draught,\\r\\nlike a woman tormented with thirst, and then gave it back to me without\\r\\neven saying \"Thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I offered her the cherries. \"Please take some,\" I said; \"we shall\\r\\nbe so pleased if you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of her corner she looked at all the fruit spread out before her, and\\r\\nsaid so rapidly that I could scarcely follow her: \"_A me non piacciono\\r\\nne le ciliegie ne le susine; amo soltano le fragole_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she does not care for cherries or plums, but only for\\r\\nstrawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a newspaper full of wild strawberries on her lap, and she ate them\\r\\nquickly, throwing them into her mouth from some distance in a coquettish\\r\\nand charming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had finished the little red heap which we had seen rapidly\\r\\ndiminishing, crushed and disappearing under the rapid action of her\\r\\nhands, I asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What may I offer you now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take a little chicken,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe certainly devoured half of it, tearing it to pieces with the rapid\\r\\nmovements of her jaws like some carnivorous animal. Then she made up her\\r\\nmind to have some cherries, which she \"did not like,\" then some plums,\\r\\nthen some little cakes. Then she said, \"I have had enough,\" and sat back\\r\\nin her corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was much amused, and tried to make her eat more, pressing her, in\\r\\nfact, till she suddenly got in a rage again, and flung such a furious\\r\\n_mica_ at me, that I would no longer run the risk of spoiling her\\r\\ndigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to my friend. \"My poor Paul,\" I said, \"I am afraid we have had\\r\\nour trouble for nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night came on, one of those hot summer nights which extend their\\r\\nwarm shade over the burning and exhausted earth. Here and there, in the\\r\\ndistance by the sea on capes and promontories, bright stars began to\\r\\nshine on the dark horizon, which I was, at times, almost inclined to\\r\\nconfound with lighthouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scent of the orange-trees became more penetrating, and we breathed\\r\\nwith delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply. The balmy\\r\\nair was soft, delicious, almost divine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed something like a shower of stars under the dense\\r\\nshade of the trees along the line, where it was quite dark. It might\\r\\nhave been taken for drops of light, leaping, flying, playing and running\\r\\namong the leaves, or for small stars fallen from the skies in order to\\r\\nhave an excursion on the earth; but they were only fireflies dancing a\\r\\nstrange fiery ballet in the perfumed air.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them happened to come into our carriage, and shed its\\r\\nintermittent light, which seemed to be extinguished one moment and to be\\r\\nburning the next. I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade, and\\r\\nwatched the strange fly careering about in its fiery flight. Suddenly it\\r\\nsettled on the dark hair of our neighbor, who was half dozing after\\r\\ndinner. Paul seemed delighted, with his eyes fixed on the bright,\\r\\nsparkling spot which looked like a living jewel on the forehead of the\\r\\nsleeping woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian woke up at about eleven o\\'clock, with the bright insect\\r\\nstill in her hair. When I saw her move, I said: \"We are just getting to\\r\\nGenoa, madam,\" and she murmured, without answering me, as if possessed\\r\\nby some obstinate and embarrassing thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What am I going to do, I wonder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she suddenly asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so taken aback that I really did not understand her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? How do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe repeated, looking more and more furious:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to go with you now, as soon as we get out of the\\r\\ntrain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite willing; but where do you want to go to? Where shall I take\\r\\nyou to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrugged her shoulders with an air of supreme indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wherever you like; what does it matter to me?\" She repeated her _Che mi\\r\\nfa_? twice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we are going to the hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, let us all go to the hotel,\" she said, in a contemptuous\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She wants to know if we should like her to come with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend\\'s utter surprise restored my self-possession. He stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? Where to? What for? How?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but she made this strange proposal to me in a most\\r\\nirritable voice. I told her that we were going to the hotel, and she\\r\\nsaid: \\'Very well, let us all go there!\\' I suppose she is without a\\r\\nhalfpenny. She certainly has a very strange way of making\\r\\nacquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, who was very much excited, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite agreeable. Tell her that we will take her wherever she\\r\\nlikes.\" Then, after a moment\\'s hesitation, he said uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must know, however, with whom she wants to go--with you or with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to the Italian, who did not even seem to be listening to us,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be very happy to take you with us, but my friend wants to know\\r\\nwhether you will take my arm or his?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened her black eyes wide with vague surprise, and said, \"_Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was obliged to explain myself. \"In Italy, I believe, when a man looks\\r\\nafter a woman, fulfills all her wishes, and satisfies all her caprices,\\r\\nhe is called a _patito_. Which of us two will you take for your\\r\\n_patito_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the slightest hesitation she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul. \"You see, my friend, she chooses me; you have no\\r\\nchance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the better for you,\" he replied, in a rage. Then, after thinking\\r\\nfor a few moments, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really care about taking this creature with you? She will spoil\\r\\nour journey. What are we to do with this woman, who looks like I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what? They will not take us in at any decent hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, just began to find the Italian much nicer than I had thought\\r\\nher at first, and I was now very anxious to take her with us. The idea\\r\\ndelighted me. I already felt those little shivers which the expectation\\r\\nof a night of love sends through the veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied, \"My dear fellow, we have accepted and it is too late to\\r\\nrecede. You were the first to advise me to say \\'Yes.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very stupid,\" he growled, \"but do as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train whistled, slackened speed, and we ran into the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She\\r\\njumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of\\r\\nseeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we started off\\r\\ninto the town, Paul walking in utter silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To what hotel shall we go?\" I asked him. \"It may be difficult to get\\r\\ninto the _City of Paris_ with a woman, especially with this Italian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul interrupted me. \"Yes, with an Italian who looks more like a\\r\\nstrumpet than a duchess. However, that is no business of mine. Do just\\r\\nas you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in a state of perplexity. I had written to the _City of Paris_ to\\r\\nretain our rooms, and now I did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo commissionaires followed us with our luggage. I continued: \"You\\r\\nmight as well go on first, and say that we are coming; and give the\\r\\nlandlord to understand that I have a--a friend with me, so that we\\r\\nshould like rooms quite by themselves for us three, so as not to be\\r\\nbrought in contact with other travelers. He will understand, and we will\\r\\ndecide according to his answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul growled, \"Thank you; such sort of commissions and such parts do\\r\\nnot suit me by any means. I did not come here to get ready your\\r\\napartments or to minister to your pleasures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was urgent: \"Look here, don\\'t be angry. It is surely far better to\\r\\ngo to a good hotel than to a bad one, and it is not difficult to ask the\\r\\nlandlord for three separate bedrooms and a dining-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a stress on _three_, and that decided him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on first, and I saw him go into a large hotel while I remained\\r\\non the other side of the street dragging along my fair Italian, who did\\r\\nnot say a word, and followed by the porters with the luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul came back at last, looking as dissatisfied as my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is settled,\" he said, \"and they will take us in; but there are\\r\\nonly two bedrooms. You must settle it as you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed him, rather ashamed of going in with such a strange\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two bedrooms separated by a small sitting-room. I ordered a\\r\\ncold supper, and then I turned to the Italian with a perplexed look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have only been able to get two rooms, so you must choose which you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied with her eternal _Che mi fa_? I thereupon took her little\\r\\nblack wooden box, just like servants use, and took it into the room on\\r\\nthe right, which I had chosen for her, ... for us. A bit of paper was\\r\\nfastened on to the box, on which was written, _Mademoiselle Francesca\\r\\nRondoli, Genoa_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your name is Francesca?\" I asked, and she nodded her head, without\\r\\nreplying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall have supper directly,\" I continued. \"Meanwhile, I daresay you\\r\\nwould like to arrange your dress a little?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered with a _mica_, a word which she employed just as frequently\\r\\nas _Che mi fa_, but I went on: \"It is always pleasant after a journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I suddenly remembered that she had not, perhaps, the necessary\\r\\nobjects, for she appeared to me in a very singular position, as if she\\r\\nhad just escaped from some disagreeable adventure, and I brought her my\\r\\ndressing-case.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put out all the little instruments for cleanliness and comfort which\\r\\nit contained: a nailbrush, a new toothbrush--for I always carry a\\r\\nselection of them about with me--my nail-scissors, a nail-file, and\\r\\nsponges. I uncorked a bottle of eau de cologne, one of lavender-water,\\r\\nand a little bottle of new-mown hay, so that she might have a choice.\\r\\nThen I opened my powder-box, and put out the powder-puff, put my fine\\r\\ntowels over the water-jug, and placed a piece of new soap near the\\r\\nbasin.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe watched my movements with a vexed look in her wide open eyes,\\r\\nwithout appearing either astonished or satisfied at my forethought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is all that you require,\" I then said; \"I will tell you when\\r\\nsupper is ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned to the sitting-room I found that Paul had taken\\r\\npossession of the other room, and had shut himself in, so I sat down to\\r\\nwait.\\r\\n\\r\\nA waiter went backwards and forwards, bringing plates and glasses. He\\r\\nlaid the table slowly, then put a cold fowl on it, and told me that all\\r\\nwas ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knocked gently at Mademoiselle Rondoli\\'s door. \"Come in,\" she said,\\r\\nand when I did so I was struck by a strong, heavy smell of perfumes, as\\r\\nif I were in a hairdresser\\'s and perfumer\\'s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian was sitting on her box in an attitude either of thoughtful\\r\\ndiscontent or absent-mindedness. The towel was still folded over the\\r\\nwater-jug that was quite full, and the soap, untouched and dry, was\\r\\nlaying beside the empty basin; but one would have thought that the young\\r\\nwoman had drunk half of the bottles of scent. The eau de cologne,\\r\\nhowever, had been spared, as only about a third of it had gone; but to\\r\\nmake up for that she had used a surprising amount of lavender-water and\\r\\nnew-mown hay. A cloud of violet-powder, a vague white mist, seemed still\\r\\nto be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-powdering her\\r\\nface and neck. It seemed to cover her eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hair\\r\\non her temples like snow, while her cheeks were plastered with it, and\\r\\nlayers of it covered her nostrils, the corners of her eyes, and her\\r\\nchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she got up she exhaled such a strong odor of scent that it almost\\r\\nmade me feel faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she sat down to supper, I found that Paul was in a most execrable\\r\\ntemper, and I could get nothing out of him but blame, irritable words,\\r\\nand disagreeable compliments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMademoiselle Francesca ate like an ogre, and as soon as she had finished\\r\\nher meal she threw herself upon the sofa. As for me, I saw the decisive\\r\\nmoment approaching for settling how we were to apportion the rooms. I\\r\\ndetermined to take the bull by the horns, and sitting down by the\\r\\nItalian I said gallantly, kissing her hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As we have only two bedrooms, will you allow me to share yours with\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do just as you like,\" she said. \"It is all the same to me. _Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer indifference vexed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are sure you do not mind my being in your room with you?\" I\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all the same to me; do just as you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you like to go to bed at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I am very sleepy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up, yawned, gave Paul her hand, who took it with a furious look,\\r\\nand I lighted her into our room. A disquieting feeling haunted me. \"Here\\r\\nis all you want,\" I said again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I took care to pour half the water into the basin, and to put\\r\\na towel near the soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went back to Paul. As soon as I got into the room, he said, \"You\\r\\nhave got a nice sort of camel there!\" and I answered, laughing. \"My\\r\\ndear friend, don\\'t speak ill of sour grapes,\" and he replied,\\r\\nill-temperedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just take care how this ends, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost trembled with that feeling of fear which assails us after some\\r\\nsuspicious love escapade--that fear which spoils our pleasant meetings,\\r\\nour unexpected caresses, our chance kisses. However, I put a bold face\\r\\non the matter. \"At any rate, the girl is no adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fellow had me in his power; he had seen the shadow of my anxiety\\r\\non my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about her? You really astonish me. You pick up an\\r\\nItalian woman traveling alone by railway, and she volunteers, with most\\r\\nsingular cynicism, to go and to be your mistress in the first hotel you\\r\\ncome to. You take her with you, and then you declare that she is not\\r\\na----! And you persuade yourself that you are not running more risk than\\r\\nif you were to go and spend the night with a woman who had the\\r\\nsmall-pox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed with an unpleasant and angry laugh. I sat down, a prey to\\r\\nuneasiness. What was I to do, for he was right after all? And a struggle\\r\\nbegan within me, between desire and fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"Do as you like, I have warned you, so, do not complain of\\r\\nthe consequences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I saw an ironical gayety in his eyes, such a delight in his revenge,\\r\\nand he made fun of me so jovially that I did not hesitate any longer. I\\r\\ngave him my hand, and said, \"Good night. You know the old saying: _A\\r\\nvictory without peril is a triumph without glory_, and upon my word, the\\r\\nvictory is worth the danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with a firm step I went into Francesca\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped short at the door in surprise and astonishment. She was\\r\\nalready asleep. Sleep had overcome her when she had finished undressing,\\r\\nand she was reposing in the charming attitude of one of Titian\\'s women.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed as if she had lain down from sheer fatigue in order to take\\r\\noff her stockings, for they were lying on the bed. Then she had thought\\r\\nof something pleasant, no doubt, for she had waited to finish her\\r\\nreverie before moving, and then, closing her eyes, she had lost\\r\\nconsciousness. A nightgown, embroidered about the neck such as one buys\\r\\nin cheap ready-made shops, was lying on the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was charming, young, firm and fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing prettier than a pretty woman asleep, and in a moment,\\r\\nseeing her thus in all her naïve charms, I was going to forget my\\r\\nfriend\\'s prudent counsels, but, suddenly turning to the toilet-table, I\\r\\nsaw everything in the same state as I left it, and I sat down, anxious,\\r\\nand a prey to irresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained thus for a long time, not able to make up my mind either what\\r\\nto do. Retreat was impossible, and I must either pass the night on a\\r\\nchair, or go to bed myself at my own risk and peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no thoughts of sleeping either here or there, for my head was too\\r\\nexcited and my eyes too occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved about without stopping, feverish uncomfortable, enervated. Then\\r\\nI began to reason with myself, certainly with a view to capitulation.\\r\\n\"If I lie down that does not bind me to anything, and I shall certainly\\r\\nbe more comfortable on a mattress than on a chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI undressed slowly, and then, stepping over the sleeping girl, I\\r\\nstretched myself out against the wall, turning my back on temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this position I remained for a long time without going to sleep, when\\r\\nsuddenly my neighbor woke up. She opened her eyes with astonishment, and\\r\\nstill with that discontented look in them; then, perceiving that she was\\r\\nundressed, she got up, and calmly put on her nightgown with as much\\r\\nindifference as if I had not been present.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning, she did not trouble herself at all about me, and immediately\\r\\nwent quietly to sleep again with her head resting on her right arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, I began to meditate on human weakness and fatuity, and then I\\r\\nwent to sleep also.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up early, like a woman who is used to work in the morning. She\\r\\nwoke me up by doing so, and I watched her through my half-closed\\r\\neyelids.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came and went without hurrying herself, as if she were astonished at\\r\\nhaving nothing to do. At length she went to the toilet-table, and in a\\r\\nmoment she emptied all the scent that remained in my bottles. She\\r\\ncertainly also used some water, but very little.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was quite dressed, she sat down on her box again, and holding\\r\\none knee between her hands, she seemed to be thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment I first pretended to notice her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning, Francesca.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout seeming in at all a better temper than the previous night, she\\r\\nmurmured, \"Good morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I asked her whether she slept well, she nodded _Yes_, and jumping\\r\\nout of bed, I went and kissed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her face towards me like a child who is being kissed against\\r\\nits will; but I took her tenderly in my arms, and gently put my lips on\\r\\nher large eyes, which she closed with evident distaste under my kisses\\r\\non her fresh cheeks and full lips which she turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t seem to like being kissed,\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Mica_\" was her only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the trunk by her side, and, passing my arm through hers, I\\r\\nsaid: \"_Mica! mica! mica_! in reply to everything. I shall call you\\r\\nMademoiselle _Mica_, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time I fancied that I saw the shadow of a smile on her\\r\\nlips, but it passed by so quickly that I may have been mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you never say anything but _Mica_ I shall not know what to do to\\r\\ntry to please you. Let us see; what shall we do to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated a moment as if some fancy had flitted through her head,\\r\\nand then she said carelessly: \"It is all the same to me; whatever you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, Mademoiselle _Mica_, we will have a carriage and go for a\\r\\ndrive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you please,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was waiting for us in the dining-room, looking as bored as third\\r\\nparties generally do in love affairs. I assumed a delighted air, and\\r\\nshook hands with him with triumphant energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking of doing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all we will go and see a little of the town, and then we might\\r\\ntake a carriage, for a drive in the neighborhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe breakfasted nearly in silence and then started. I dragged Francesca\\r\\nfrom palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely just\\r\\nglanced carelessly at all the various masterpieces. Paul followed us,\\r\\ngrowling all sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a\\r\\nsilent drive into the country and returned to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day it was the same thing and the next day again; so on the\\r\\nthird Paul said to me: \"Look here, I am going to leave you; I am not\\r\\ngoing to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this\\r\\ncreature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was perplexed and annoyed, for to my great surprise I had become\\r\\nsingularly attached to Francesca. A man is but weak and foolish, carried\\r\\naway by the merest trifle, and a coward every time that his senses are\\r\\nexcited or mastered. I clung to this unknown girl, silent and\\r\\ndissatisfied as she always was. I liked her somewhat ill-tempered face,\\r\\nthe dissatisfied droop of her mouth, the weariness of her look; I liked\\r\\nher fatigued movements, the contemptuous way in which she yielded to my\\r\\ndesires, the very indifference of her caresses. A secret bond, that\\r\\nmysterious bond of animal love, the secret attachment of that possession\\r\\nwhich does not satiate, bound me to her. I told Paul so, quite frankly.\\r\\nHe treated me as if I had been a fool, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, take her with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she obstinately refused to leave Genoa, without giving any reason. I\\r\\nbesought, I reasoned, I promised, but all was of no avail, and so I\\r\\nstayed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul declared that he would go by himself, and went so far as to pack up\\r\\nhis portmanteau; but he remained all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus a fortnight passed. Francesca was always silent and irritable,\\r\\nlived beside me rather than with me, responded to all my desires, all my\\r\\ndemands, and all my propositions with her perpetual _Che mi fa_, or\\r\\nwith her no less perpetual _Mica_.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend got more and more furious, but my only answer was, \"You can go\\r\\nif you are tired of staying. I am not detaining you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called me names, overwhelmed me with reproaches, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\"Where do you think I can go to now? We had three weeks at our disposal,\\r\\nand here is a fortnight gone! I cannot continue my journey now; and, in\\r\\nany case, I am not going to Venice, Florence, and Rome all by myself.\\r\\nBut you will pay for it, and more dearly than you think for, most\\r\\nlikely. You are not going to bring a man all the way from Paris in order\\r\\nto shut him up at an hotel in Genoa with an Italian adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I told him, very calmly, to return to Paris, he exclaimed that he\\r\\nwas going to do so the very next day; but the next day he was still\\r\\nthere, still in a rage and swearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time we began to be known in the streets through which we\\r\\nwandered from morning till night. Sometimes French people would turn\\r\\nround astonished at meeting their fellow-countrymen in the company of\\r\\nthis girl with her striking costume, and who looked singularly out of\\r\\nplace, not to say compromising, beside us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to walk along, leaning on my arm, without looking at anything.\\r\\nWhy did she remain with me, with us, who seemed to procure her so little\\r\\npleasure? Who was she? Where did she come from? What was she doing? Had\\r\\nshe any plan or idea? Where did she live? As an adventuress, or by\\r\\nchance meetings? I tried in vain to find out and to explain it. The\\r\\nbetter I knew her the more enigmatical she became. She was not one of\\r\\nthose who make a living by any profession of venal love. She rather\\r\\nseemed to me to be a girl of poor family who had been seduced and taken\\r\\naway, and then cast aside and lost. What did she think was going to\\r\\nbecome of her, or whom was she waiting for? She certainly did not appear\\r\\nto be trying to make a conquest of me, or to get any real profit out of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to question her, to speak to her of her childhood and family;\\r\\nbut she never gave me an answer. I stayed with her, my heart unfettered\\r\\nand my senses enchained, never wearied of holding her in my arms, that\\r\\nproud and quarrelsome woman, captivated by my senses, or rather seduced,\\r\\novercome by a youthful, healthy, powerful charm, which emanated from her\\r\\nsweet-smelling person and from the robust lines of her body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother week passed, and the term of my journey was drawing on, for I\\r\\nhad to be back in Paris by July 11. By this time Paul had come to take\\r\\nhis part in the adventure, though still grumbling at me, while I\\r\\ninvented pleasures, distractions, and excursions to amuse my mistress\\r\\nand my friend; and in order to do this I gave myself a large amount of\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day I proposed an excursion to Sta Margarita, that charming little\\r\\ntown in the midst of gardens, hidden at the foot of a slope which\\r\\nstretches far into the sea up to the village of Portofino. We all three\\r\\nwere following the excellent road which goes along the foot of the\\r\\nmountain. Suddenly Francesca said to me: \"I shall not be able to go with\\r\\nyou to-morrow; I must go and see some of my relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all; I did not ask her any questions, as I was quite sure she\\r\\nwould not answer me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she got up very early; then, as I remained in bed, she\\r\\nsat down at the foot of it, and said in a constrained and hesitating\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I do not come back to-night, shall you come and fetch me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly I shall,\" was my reply. \"Where must I come to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she explained: \"You must go into the Street Victor-Emmanuel, down\\r\\nthe Passage Falene, and go into the furniture shop at the bottom, in a\\r\\ncourt, and there you must ask for Mme. Rondoli--That is where it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she went away, leaving me rather astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Paul saw that I was alone he stammered out: \"Where is Francesca?\"\\r\\nAnd when I told him what had happened he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, let us make use of our chance, and bolt; as it is, our\\r\\ntime is up. Two days, more or less, make no difference. Let us start at\\r\\nonce; go and pack up your things. Off we go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused. I could not, as I told him, leave the girl in such a\\r\\nmanner, after having lived with her for nearly three weeks. At any rate,\\r\\nI ought to say good-bye to her, and make her accept a present; I\\r\\ncertainly had no intention of behaving badly to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he would not listen; he pressed and worried me, but I would not give\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained indoors for several hours, expecting Francesca\\'s return, but\\r\\nshe did not come, and at last, at dinner, Paul said with a triumphant\\r\\nair: \"She has thrown you over, my dear fellow; it is certainly very\\r\\nstrange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI must acknowledge that I was surprised and rather vexed. He laughed in\\r\\nmy face, and made fun of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not exactly a bad way of getting rid of you, though rather\\r\\nprimitive. \\'Just wait for me, I shall be back in a moment,\\' they often\\r\\nsay. How long are you going to wait? I should not wonder if you were\\r\\nfoolish enough to go and look for her at the address she gave you. \\'Does\\r\\nMme. Rondoli live here, please?\\' \\'No, Sir.\\' I\\'ll bet that you are\\r\\nlonging to go there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least,\" I protested, \"and I assure you that if she does not\\r\\ncome back to-morrow morning I shall start by the express at eight\\r\\no\\'clock. I shall have waited twenty-four hours, and that is enough; my\\r\\nconscience will be quite clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent an uneasy and unpleasant evening, for I really had at heart a\\r\\nvery tender feeling for her. I went to bed at twelve o\\'clock, and hardly\\r\\nslept at all. I got up at six, called Paul, packed up my things, and two\\r\\nhours later we started for France together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next year, at just about the same period, I was seized, as one is\\r\\nwith a periodical fever, with a new desire to go to Italy, and I\\r\\nimmediately made up my mind to carry it into effect. There is no doubt\\r\\nthat every well-educated man ought to see Florence, Venice, and Rome. It\\r\\nhas, also, the additional advantage of providing many subjects of\\r\\nconversation in society, and of giving one an opportunity for bringing\\r\\nforward artistic generalities which appear profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I went alone, and I arrived at Genoa at the same time as the\\r\\nyear before, but without any adventure on the road. I went to the same\\r\\nhotel, and actually happened to have the same room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was scarcely in bed when the recollection of Francesca which, since\\r\\nthe evening before, had been floating vaguely through my mind, haunted\\r\\nme with strange persistency. I thought of her nearly the whole night,\\r\\nand by degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at\\r\\nfirst, which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up\\r\\nmy mind to spend the next day in Genoa to try and find her, and if I\\r\\nshould not succeed, I would take the evening train.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning I set out on my search. I remembered the directions\\r\\nshe had given me when she left me, perfectly--Victor-Emmanuel Street,\\r\\netc., etc., house of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on\\r\\nthe right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it without the least difficulty, and I knocked at the door of a\\r\\nsomewhat dilapidated-looking dwelling. A fat woman opened it, who must\\r\\nhave been very handsome, but who actually was only very dirty. Although\\r\\nshe was too fat, she still bore the lines of majestic beauty; her untidy\\r\\nhair fell over her forehead and shoulders, and one fancied one could see\\r\\nher fat body floating about in an enormous dressing-gown covered with\\r\\nspots of dirt and grease. Round her neck she wore a great gilt necklace,\\r\\nand on her wrists were splendid bracelets of Genoa filigree work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rather a hostile manner she asked me what I wanted, and I replied by\\r\\nrequesting her to tell me whether Francesca Rondoli lived there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want with her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had the pleasure of meeting her last year, and I should like to see\\r\\nher again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman looked at me suspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you meet her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why here, in Genoa itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated a moment, and then I told her. I had scarcely done so when\\r\\nthe Italian put out her arms as if to embrace me. \"Oh! you are the\\r\\nFrenchman; how glad I am to see you! But what grief you caused the poor\\r\\nchild. She waited for you a month; yes, a whole month. At first she\\r\\nthought you would come to fetch her. She wanted to see whether you loved\\r\\nher. If you only knew how she cried when she saw that you were not\\r\\ncoming! She cried till she seemed to have no tears left. Then she went\\r\\nto the hotel, but you had gone. She thought that most likely you were\\r\\ntraveling in Italy, and that you would return by Genoa to fetch her, as\\r\\nshe would not go with you. And she waited more than a month, Monsieur;\\r\\nand she was so unhappy; so unhappy. I am her mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI really felt a little disconcerted, but I regained my self-possession,\\r\\nand asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has gone to Paris with a painter, a delightful man, who loves her\\r\\nvery much, and who gives her everything that she wants. Just look at\\r\\nwhat she sent me; they are very pretty, are they not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she showed me, with quite Southern animation, her heavy bracelets\\r\\nand necklace. \"I have also,\" she continued, \"earrings with stones in\\r\\nthem, a silk dress, and some rings; but I only wear them on grand\\r\\noccasions. Oh! she is very happy, Sir, very happy. She will be so\\r\\npleased when I tell her you have been here. But pray come in and sit\\r\\ndown. You will take something or other, surely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused, as I now wished to get away by the first train; but she\\r\\ntook me by the arm and pulled me in, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please, come in; I must tell her that you have been in here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI found myself in a small, rather dark room, furnished with only a table\\r\\nand a few chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"O! She is very happy now, very happy. When you met her\\r\\nin the train she was very miserable, for her lover had just left her at\\r\\nMarseilles, and she was coming back, poor child. But she liked you at\\r\\nonce, though she was still rather sad, you understand. Now she has all\\r\\nshe wants, and she writes and tells me everything that she does. His\\r\\nname is Bellemin, and they say he is a great painter in your country. He\\r\\nmet her in the street here, and fell in love with her out of hand. But\\r\\nyou will take a glass of syrup?--it is very good. Are you quite alone,\\r\\nthis year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"quite alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt an increasing inclination to laugh, as my first disappointment\\r\\nwas dispelled by what Mother Rondoli said. I was obliged, however, to\\r\\ndrink a glass of her syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you are quite alone?\" she continued. \"How sorry I am that Francesca\\r\\nis not here now; she would have been company for you all the time you\\r\\nstayed. It is not very amusing to go about all by oneself, and she will\\r\\nbe very sorry also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting up to go, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But would you not like Carlotta to go with you? She knows all the\\r\\nwalks very well. She is my second daughter, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt she took my look of surprise for consent, for she opened the\\r\\ninner door and called out up the dark stairs which I could not see:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Carlotta! Carlotta! make haste down, my dear child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to protest, but she would not listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; she will be very glad to go with you; she is very nice, and much\\r\\nmore cheerful than her sister, and she is a good girl, a very good girl,\\r\\nwhom I love very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments, a tall, slender, dark girl appeared, with her hair\\r\\nhanging down, and whose youthful figure showed unmistakably beneath an\\r\\nold dress of her mother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter at once told her how matters stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Francesca\\'s Frenchman, you know, the one whom she knew last\\r\\nyear. He is quite alone, and has come to look for her, poor fellow; so I\\r\\ntold him that you would go with him to keep him company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked at me with her handsome dark eyes, and said, smiling:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no objection, if he wishes it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not possibly refuse, and merely said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I shall be very glad of your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother pushed her out. \"Go and get dressed directly; put on your\\r\\nblue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had left the room the old woman explained herself: \"I\\r\\nhave two others, but they are much younger. It costs a lot of money to\\r\\nbring up four children. Luckily the eldest is off my hands at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told all about herself, about her husband, who had been an\\r\\nemployé on the railway, but who was dead, and she expatiated on the good\\r\\nqualities of Carlotta, her second girl, who soon returned, dressed, as\\r\\nher sister had been, in a striking, peculiar manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother examined her from head to foot, and, after finding everything\\r\\nright, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my children, you can go.\" Then turning to the girl, she said: \"Be\\r\\nsure you are back by ten o\\'clock to-night; you know the door is locked\\r\\nthen.\" The answer was:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, mamma; don\\'t alarm yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took my arm, and we went wandering about the streets, just as I had\\r\\ndone the previous year with her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the hotel for lunch, and then I took my new friend to\\r\\nSanta Margarita, just as I had done with her sister the year previously.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she did not go home that night, although the door was to be closed\\r\\nat ten o\\'clock!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole fortnight which I had at my disposal I took Carlotta to\\r\\nall the places of interest in and about Genoa. She gave me no cause to\\r\\nregret the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cried when I left her, and the morning of my departure I gave her\\r\\nfour bracelets for her mother, besides a substantial token of my\\r\\naffection for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days I intend to return to Italy, and I cannot help\\r\\nremembering, with a certain amount of uneasiness, mingled with hope,\\r\\nthat Mme. Rondoli has two more daughters.',\n"," 'CHÂLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral de la Vallee, who seemed to be half asleep in his armchair, said\\r\\nin a voice which sounded like an old woman\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had a very singular little love adventure once; would you like to\\r\\nhear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke from the depths of his great chair, with that everlasting dry,\\r\\nwrinkled smile on his lips, that smile _à la Voltaire_, which made\\r\\npeople take him for a terrible skeptic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thirty years of age and first lieutenant in the navy, when I was\\r\\nintrusted with an astronomical expedition to Central India. The English\\r\\nGovernment provided me with all the necessary means for carrying out my\\r\\nenterprise, and I was soon busied with a few followers in that strange,\\r\\nsurprising, prodigious country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would take me ten volumes to relate that journey. I went through\\r\\nwonderfully magnificent regions, and was received by strangely handsome\\r\\nprinces, who entertained me with incredible magnificence. For two months\\r\\nit seemed to me as if I were walking in a poem, and that I was going\\r\\nabout in a fairy kingdom, on the back of imaginary elephants. In the\\r\\nmidst of wild forests I discovered extraordinary ruins, delicate and\\r\\nchiseled like jewels, fine as lace and enormous as mountains, those\\r\\nfabulous, divine monuments which are so graceful that one falls in love\\r\\nwith their form like one falls in love with a woman, and that one feels\\r\\na physical and sensual pleasure in looking at them. As Victor Hugo says,\\r\\n\"_Whilst wide-awake, I was walking in a dream_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of my journey I reached Ganhard, which was formerly one\\r\\nof the most prosperous towns in Central India, but is now much decayed\\r\\nand governed by a wealthy, arbitrary, violent, generous, and cruel\\r\\nprince. His name is Rajah Maddan, a true Oriental potentate, delicate\\r\\nand barbarous, affable and sanguinary, combining feminine grace with\\r\\npitiless ferocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city lies at the bottom of a valley, on the banks of a little lake\\r\\nwhich is surrounded by pagodas, which bathe their walls in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance the city looks like a white spot which grows larger as one\\r\\napproaches it, and by degrees one discovers the domes and spires, all\\r\\nthe slender and graceful summits of Indian monuments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about an hour\\'s distance from the gates, I met a superbly caparisoned\\r\\nelephant, surrounded by a guard of honor which the sovereign had sent\\r\\nme, and I was conducted to the palace with great ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have liked to have taken the time to put on my gala uniform,\\r\\nbut royal impatience would not admit of it. He was anxious to make my\\r\\nacquaintance, to know what he might expect from me, and then he would\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was introduced into a great hall surrounded by galleries, in the midst\\r\\nof bronze-colored soldiers in splendid uniforms, while all about were\\r\\nstanding men dressed in striking robes studded with precious stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw a shining mass, a kind of sitting sun reposing on a bench like\\r\\nour garden benches, without a back; it was the rajah who was waiting for\\r\\nme, motionless, in a robe of the purest canary color. He had some ten or\\r\\nfifteen million francs worth of diamonds on him, and by itself, on his\\r\\nforehead glistened the famous star of Delhi, which has always belonged\\r\\nto the illustrious dynasty of the Pariharas of Mundore, from whom my\\r\\nhost was descended.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about five-and-twenty, who seemed to have some negro\\r\\nblood in his veins, although he belonged to the purest Hindoo race. He\\r\\nhad large, almost motionless, rather vague eyes, fat lips, a curly\\r\\nbeard, low forehead, and dazzling sharp white teeth, which he frequently\\r\\nshowed with a mechanical smile. He got up and gave me his hand in the\\r\\nEnglish fashion, and then made me sit down beside him on a bench which\\r\\nwas so high that my feet hardly touched the ground, and I was very\\r\\nuncomfortable on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately proposed a tiger hunt for the next day; war and hunting\\r\\nwere his chief occupations, and he could hardly understand how one could\\r\\ncare for anything else. He was evidently fully persuaded that I had only\\r\\ncome all that distance to amuse him a little, and to be the companion of\\r\\nhis pleasures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood greatly in need of his assistance, I tried to flatter his\\r\\ntastes, and he was so pleased with me that he immediately wished to show\\r\\nme how his trained boxers fought, and he led the way into a kind of\\r\\narena situated within the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his command two naked men appeared, their hands covered with steel\\r\\nclaws. They immediately began to attack each other, trying to strike one\\r\\nanother with this sharp weapon, which left long cuts, from which the\\r\\nblood flowed freely down their dark skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt lasted for a long time, till their bodies were a mass of wounds, and\\r\\nthe combatants were tearing each other\\'s flesh with this sort of rake\\r\\nmade of pointed blades. One of them had his jaw smashed, while the ear\\r\\nof the other was split into three pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked on with ferocious pleasure, uttered grunts of delight,\\r\\nand imitated all their movements with careless gestures, crying out\\r\\nconstantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike, strike hard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fell down unconscious, and had to be carried out of the arena,\\r\\ncovered with blood, while the rajah uttered a sigh of regret because it\\r\\nwas over so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to me to know my opinion; I was disgusted, but I congratulated\\r\\nhim loudly. He then gave orders that I was to be conducted to\\r\\nCouch-Mahal (the palace of pleasure), where I was to be lodged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bijou palace was situated at the extremity of the royal park, and\\r\\none of its walls was built into the sacred lake of Vihara. It was\\r\\nsquare, with three rows of galleries with colonnades of most beautiful\\r\\nworkmanship. At each angle there were light, lofty or low towers,\\r\\nstanding either singly or in pairs: no two were alike, and they looked\\r\\nlike flowers growing out of that graceful plant of Oriental\\r\\narchitecture. All were surmounted by fantastic roofs, like coquettish\\r\\nladies\\' caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the edifice a large dome raised its round cupola like a\\r\\nlarge white woman\\'s breast, beside a beautiful clock-tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole building was covered with sculpture from top to bottom, with\\r\\nthose exquisite arabesques which delight the eye, of motionless\\r\\nprocessions of delicate figures whose attitudes and gestures in stone\\r\\ntold the story of Indian manners and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rooms were lighted by windows with dentelated arches, looking on to\\r\\nthe gardens. On the marble floor were designs of graceful bouquets in\\r\\nonyx, lapis-lazuli, and agate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely had time to finish my toilet when Haribada, a court\\r\\ndignitary who was specially charged to communicate between the prince\\r\\nand me, announced his sovereign\\'s visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saffron-colored rajah appeared, again shook hands with me, and began\\r\\nto tell me a thousand different things, constantly asking me for my\\r\\nopinion, which I had great difficulty in giving him. Then he wished to\\r\\nshow me the ruins of the former palace at the other extremity of the\\r\\ngardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a real forest of stones inhabited by a large tribe of apes. On\\r\\nour approach the males began to run along the walls, making the most\\r\\nhideous faces at us, while the females ran away, showing their bare\\r\\nrumps, and carrying off their young in their arms. The rajah shouted\\r\\nwith laughter and pinched my arm to draw my attention, and to testify\\r\\nhis own delight, and sat down in the midst of the ruins, while around\\r\\nus, squatting on the top of the walls, perching on every eminence, a\\r\\nnumber of animals with white whiskers put out their tongues and shook\\r\\ntheir fists at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had seen enough of this, the yellow rajah rose and began to walk\\r\\nsedately on, keeping me always at his side, happy at having shown me\\r\\nsuch things on the very day of my arrival, and reminding me that a grand\\r\\ntiger-hunt was to take place the next day, in my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was present at it, at a second, a third, at ten, twenty in succession.\\r\\nWe hunted all the animals which the country produces in turn; the\\r\\npanther, the bear, elephant, antelope, the hippopotamus and the\\r\\ncrocodile--what do I know of, half the beasts in creation I should say.\\r\\nI was disgusted at seeing so much blood flow, and tired of this\\r\\nmonotonous pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the prince\\'s ardor abated and, at my urgent request, he left\\r\\nme a little leisure for work, and contented himself by loading me with\\r\\ncostly presents. He sent me jewels, magnificent stuffs, and well-broken\\r\\nanimals of all sorts, which Haribada presented to me with apparently as\\r\\ngrave respect as if I had been the sun himself although he heartily\\r\\ndespised me at the bottom of his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day a procession of servants brought me in covered dishes, a\\r\\nportion of each course that was served at the royal table; every day he\\r\\nseemed to take an extreme pleasure in getting up some new entertainment\\r\\nfor me--dances by the Bayaderes, jugglers, reviews of the troops, and I\\r\\nwas obliged to pretend to be most delighted with it, so as not to hurt\\r\\nhis feelings when he wished to show me his wonderful country in all its\\r\\ncharm and all its splendor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as I was left alone for a few moments I either worked or went to\\r\\nsee the monkeys, whose company pleased me a great deal better than that\\r\\nof their royal master.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, however, on coming back from a walk, I found Haribada\\r\\noutside the gate of my palace. He told me in mysterious tones that a\\r\\ngift from the king was waiting for me in my room, and he said that his\\r\\nmaster begged me to excuse him for not having sooner thought of offering\\r\\nme that of which I had been deprived for such a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these obscure remarks the ambassador bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went in I saw six little girls standing against the wall\\r\\nmotionless, side-by-side, like smelts on a skewer. The eldest was\\r\\nperhaps ten and the youngest eight years old. For the first moment I\\r\\ncould not understand why this girls\\' school had taken up its abode in my\\r\\nrooms; then, however, I divined the prince\\'s delicate attention: he had\\r\\nmade me a present of a harem, and had chosen it very young from an\\r\\nexcess of generosity. There, the more unripe the fruit is, in the higher\\r\\nestimation it is held.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I remained confused and embarrassed, ashamed in the\\r\\npresence of these children, who looked at me with great grave eyes which\\r\\nseemed already to divine what I should want of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not know what to say to them; I felt inclined to send them back;\\r\\nbut one cannot return the presents of a prince; it would have been a\\r\\nmortal insult. I was obliged, therefore, to keep them, and to install\\r\\nthis troop of children in my rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood motionless, looking at me, waiting for my orders, trying to\\r\\nread my thoughts in my eyes. Confound such a present! How dreadfully it\\r\\nwas in my way. At last, thinking that I must be looking rather\\r\\nridiculous, I asked the eldest her name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Châli,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little creature, with her beautiful skin, which was slightly\\r\\nyellow, like old ivory, was a marvel, a perfect statue, with her face\\r\\nand its long and severe lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then asked, in order to see what she would reply, and also, perhaps,\\r\\nto embarrass her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you come here for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied, in her soft, harmonious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come to be altogether at my lord\\'s disposal, and to do whatever\\r\\nhe wishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was evidently quite resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put the same question to the youngest, who answered immediately in her\\r\\nshrill voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here to do whatever you ask me, my master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one was like a little mouse, and was very taking, just as they all\\r\\nwere, so I took her in my arms and kissed her. The others made a\\r\\nmovement to go away, thinking, no doubt, that I had made my choice; but\\r\\nI ordered them to stay, and sitting down in the Indian fashion, I made\\r\\nthem all sit round me, and began to tell them fairy-tales, for I spoke\\r\\ntheir language tolerably well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey listened very attentively, and trembled, wringing their hands in\\r\\nagony. Poor little things, they were not thinking any longer of the\\r\\nreason why they were sent to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had finished my story, I called Latchmân, my confidential\\r\\nservant, and made him bring sweetmeats and cakes, of which they ate\\r\\nenough to make themselves ill; then, as I began to find the adventure\\r\\nrather funny, I organized games to amuse my wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these diversions had an enormous success. I made a bridge of my\\r\\nlegs, and the six children ran underneath, the smallest beginning and\\r\\nthe tallest always knocking against them a little, because she did not\\r\\nstoop enough. It made them shout with laughter, and these young voices\\r\\nsounding beneath the low vaults of my sumptuous palace, seemed to wake\\r\\nit up and to people it with childlike gaiety, filling it with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext I took great interest in seeing to the sleeping apartments of my\\r\\ninnocent concubines, and in the end I saw them safely locked up under\\r\\nthe surveillance of four female servants, whom the prince had sent me at\\r\\nthe same time in order to take care of my sultanas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a week I took the greatest pleasure in acting the papa towards\\r\\nthese living dolls. We had capital games of _hide-and-seek_,\\r\\n_puss-in-the-corner_, &c., which gave them the greatest pleasure, for\\r\\nevery day I taught them a new game, to their intense delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy house now seemed to be one large class, and my little friends,\\r\\ndressed in beautiful silk stuffs, and in materials embroidered with gold\\r\\nand silver, ran up and down the long galleries and the quiet rooms like\\r\\nlittle human animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one evening, without my knowing exactly how it happened, the\\r\\noldest of them, the one called Châli, and who looked so like an ivory\\r\\nstatue, became my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an adorable little creature, timid and gentle, who soon got to\\r\\nlove me ardently, with some degree of shame, with hesitation as if\\r\\nafraid of European justice, with reserve and scruples, and yet with\\r\\npassionate tenderness. I cherished her as if I had been her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg your pardon, ladies; I am going rather too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others continued to play in the palace, like a lot of happy kittens,\\r\\nand Châli never left me except when I went to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed delicious hours together in the ruins of the old castle, among\\r\\nthe monkeys, who had become our friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to lie on my knees, and remain there, turning all sorts of\\r\\nthings over in her little sphinx\\'s head, or perhaps not thinking of\\r\\nanything, retaining that beautiful, charming, hereditary pose of that\\r\\nnoble and dreamy people, the hieratic pose of the sacred statues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large brass dish I had brought provisions, cakes, fruits. The apes\\r\\ncame nearer and nearer, followed by their young ones, who were more\\r\\ntimid; at last they sat down round us in a circle, without daring to\\r\\ncome any nearer, waiting for me to distribute my delicacies. Then,\\r\\nalmost invariably, a male more daring than the rest would come to me\\r\\nwith outstretched hand, like a beggar, and I would give him something,\\r\\nwhich he would take to his wife. All the others immediately began to\\r\\nutter furious cries, cries of rage and jealousy; and I could not make\\r\\nthe terrible racket cease except by throwing each one his share.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was very comfortable in the ruins I had my instruments brought\\r\\nthere, so that I might be able to work. As soon, however, as they saw\\r\\nthe copper fittings on my scientific instruments, the monkeys, no doubt\\r\\ntaking them for some deadly engines, fled on all sides, uttering the\\r\\nmost piercing cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nI often also spent my evenings with Châli on one of the external\\r\\ngalleries that looked on to the lake of Vihara. Without speaking we\\r\\nlooked at the bright moon gliding over the sky and throwing a mantle of\\r\\ntrembling silver over the water, and down there, on the further shore,\\r\\nthe row of small pagodas like elegant mushrooms with their stalks in the\\r\\nwater. Taking the thoughtful head of my little mistress between my\\r\\nhands, I printed a long, soft kiss on her polished brow, on her great\\r\\neyes, which were full of the secret of that ancient and fabulous land,\\r\\nand on her calm lips which opened to my caress. I felt a confused,\\r\\npowerful, above all, a poetical, sensation, the sensation that I\\r\\npossessed a whole race in this little girl, that mysterious race from\\r\\nwhich all the others seem to have taken their origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, however, continued to load me with presents. One day he sent\\r\\nme a very unexpected object, which excited a passionate admiration in\\r\\nChâli. It was merely one of those cardboard boxes covered with shells\\r\\nstuck on outside, and they can be bought at any European seaside resort\\r\\nfor a penny or two. But there it was a jewel beyond price, and no doubt\\r\\nwas the first that had found its way into the kingdom. I put it on a\\r\\ntable and left it there, wondering at the value which was set upon this\\r\\ntrumpery article out of a bazaar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Châli never got tired of looking at it, of admiring it ecstatically.\\r\\nFrom time to time she would say to me, \"May I touch it?\" And when I had\\r\\ngiven her permission she raised the lid, closed it again with the\\r\\ngreatest precaution, touched the shells very gently, and the contact\\r\\nseemed to give her real physical pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I had finished my work, and it was time for me to return. I was\\r\\na long time in making up my mind, kept back by my tenderness for my\\r\\nlittle friend, but at last I was obliged to fix the day of my departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince got up fresh hunting excursions and fresh wrestling matches,\\r\\nand after a fortnight of these pleasures I declared that I could stay no\\r\\nlonger, and he gave me my liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy farewell from Châli was heartrending. She wept, lying beside me, with\\r\\nher head on my breast, shaken with sobs. I did not know how to console\\r\\nher; my kisses were no good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an idea struck me, and getting up I went and got the\\r\\nshell-box, and putting it into her hands, I said, \"That is for you; it\\r\\nis yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw her smile at first. Her whole face was lighted up with\\r\\ninternal joy, with that profound joy when impossible dreams are suddenly\\r\\nrealized, and she embraced me ardently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, she wept bitterly when I bade her a last farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave paternal kisses and cakes to all the rest of my wives, and then I\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years had passed when my duties again called me to Bombay, and,\\r\\nbecause I knew the country and the language well, I was left there to\\r\\nundertake another mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finished what I had to do as quickly as possible, and as I had a\\r\\nconsiderable amount of spare time on my hands I determined to go and see\\r\\nmy friend the King of Ganhard and my dear little Châli once more, though\\r\\nI expected to find her much changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rajah received me with every demonstration of pleasure, and hardly\\r\\nleft me for a moment during the first day of my visit. At night,\\r\\nhowever, when I was alone, I sent for Haribada, and after several\\r\\nmisleading questions I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know what has become of little Châli, whom the rajah gave me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately assumed a sad and troubled look, and said, in evident\\r\\nembarrassment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had better not speak of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why? She was a dear little woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She turned out badly, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--Châli? What has become of her? Where is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean to say that she came to a bad end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bad end! Is she dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. She committed a very dreadful action.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very much distressed. I felt my heart beat, and my breast was\\r\\noppressed with grief, and insisted on knowing what she had done and what\\r\\nhad happened to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man became more and more embarrassed, and murmured, \"You had better\\r\\nnot ask about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She stole--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who--Châli? What did she steal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something that belonged to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me? What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day you left she stole that little box which the prince had given\\r\\nyou; it was found in her hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What box are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The box covered with shells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I gave it to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian looked at me with stupefaction, then replied: \"Well, she\\r\\ndeclared with the most sacred oaths that you had given it to her, but\\r\\nnobody could believe that you could have given a king\\'s present to a\\r\\nslave, and so the rajah had her punished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was she punished? What was done to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was tied up in a sack, and thrown into the lake from this window,\\r\\nfrom the window of the room in which we are, where she had committed the\\r\\ntheft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt the most terrible grief that I ever experienced, and I made a\\r\\nsign to Haribada to go away, so that he might not see my tears; and I\\r\\nspent the night on the gallery that looked on to the lake, on the\\r\\ngallery where I had so often held the poor child on my knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pictured to myself her pretty little body lying decomposed in a sack\\r\\nin the dark waters beneath me, which we had so often looked at together\\r\\nformerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day I left again, in spite of the rajah\\'s entreaties and\\r\\nevident vexation; and I now still feel as if I had never loved any woman\\r\\nbut Châli.',\n"," 'THE UMBRELLA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille was a very economical woman; she thoroughly knew the value\\r\\nof a halfpenny, and possessed a whole storehouse of strict principles\\r\\nwith regard to the multiplication of money, so that her cook found the\\r\\ngreatest difficulty in making what the servants call their\\r\\n_market-penny_, while her husband was hardly allowed any pocket-money at\\r\\nall. They were, however, very comfortably off, and had no children; but\\r\\nit really pained Mme. Oreille to see any money spent; it was like\\r\\ntearing at her heartstrings when she had to take any of those nice\\r\\ncrown-pieces out of her pocket; and whenever she had to spend anything,\\r\\nno matter how necessary it was, she slept badly the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was continually saying to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really might be more liberal, as we have no children, and never\\r\\nspend our income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know what may happen,\" she used to reply. \"It is better to\\r\\nhave too much than too little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little woman of about forty, very active, rather hasty,\\r\\nwrinkled, very neat and tidy, and with a very short temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband very often used to complain of all the privations she made\\r\\nhim endure; some of them were particularly painful to him, as they\\r\\ntouched his vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was one of the upper clerks in the War Office, and only kept on there\\r\\nin obedience to his wife\\'s wish, so as to increase their income, which\\r\\nthey did not nearly spend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched\\r\\numbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow-clerks. At last he got\\r\\ntired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife buying him a new one.\\r\\nShe bought one for eight francs and a half, one of those cheap articles\\r\\nwhich large houses sell as an advertisement. When the others in the\\r\\noffice saw the article, which was being sold in Paris by the thousands,\\r\\nthey began their jokes again, and Oreille had a dreadful time of it with\\r\\nthem, and they even made a song about it, which he heard from morning\\r\\ntill night all over the immense building.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new\\r\\none, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so\\r\\nthat he might see that it was all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger\\r\\nas she gave it to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will last you for five years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille felt quite triumphant, and obtained a small ovation at the\\r\\noffice with his new acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he went home in the evening, his wife said to him, looking at the\\r\\numbrella uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very\\r\\nlikely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a\\r\\nnew one in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, unfastened it, and remained dumbfounded with astonishment\\r\\nand rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a\\r\\nsixpenny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband replied quietly, without looking at it: \"What is it? What do\\r\\nyou mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was choking with rage, and could hardly get out a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--you--have burnt--your umbrella! Why--you must be--mad! Do you wish\\r\\nto ruin us outright?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round, and felt that he was growing pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say that you have burnt your umbrella. Just look here--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rushing at him as if she were going to beat him, she violently\\r\\nthrust the little circular burnt hole under his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so utterly struck dumb at the sight of it that he could only\\r\\nstammer out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--what is it? How should I know? I have done nothing, I will swear.\\r\\nI don\\'t know what is the matter with the umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been playing tricks with it at the office; you have been\\r\\nplaying the fool and opening it, to show it off,\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only opened it once, to let them see what a nice one it was, that is\\r\\nall, I declare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she shook with rage, and got up one of those conjugal scenes which\\r\\nmake a peaceable man dread the domestic hearth more than a battlefield\\r\\nwhere bullets are raining.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mended it with a piece of silk cut out of the old umbrella, which\\r\\nwas of a different color, and the next day Oreille went off very humbly\\r\\nwith the mended article in his hand. He put it into a cupboard, and\\r\\nthought no more about it than one thinks of some unpleasant\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the\\r\\numbrella from him, opened it, and nearly had a fit when she saw what had\\r\\nbefallen it, for the disaster was irreparable. It was covered with small\\r\\nholes, which, evidently, proceeded from burns, just as if someone had\\r\\nemptied the ashes from a lighted pipe on to it. It was done for utterly,\\r\\nirreparably.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at it without a word, in too great a passion to be able to\\r\\nsay anything. He also, when he saw the damage, remained almost struck\\r\\nstupid, in a state of frightened consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other, then he looked on to the floor; and the next\\r\\nmoment she threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a\\r\\ntransport of the most violent rage, for she had recovered her voice by\\r\\nthat time:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you brute! you brute! You did it on purpose, but I will pay you out\\r\\nfor it. You shall not have another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the scene began again, and after the storm had raged for an\\r\\nhour, he, at last, was enabled to explain himself. He declared that he\\r\\ncould not understand it at all, and that it could only proceed from\\r\\nmalice or from vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ring at the bell saved him; it was a friend whom they were expecting\\r\\nfor dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille submitted the case to him. As for buying a new umbrella,\\r\\nthat was out of the question; her husband should not have another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend very sensibly said that in that case his clothes would be\\r\\nspoilt, and they were certainly worth more than the umbrella. But the\\r\\nlittle woman, who was still in a rage, replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then, when it rains he may have the kitchen umbrella, for I\\r\\nwill not give him a new silk one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille utterly rebelled at such an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said; \"then I shall resign my post. I am not going to\\r\\nthe office with the kitchen umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend interposed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have this one re-covered; it will not cost much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mme. Oreille, being in the temper that she was, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will cost at least eight francs to re-cover it. Eight and eighteen\\r\\nare twenty-six. Just fancy, twenty-six francs for an umbrella! It is\\r\\nutter madness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend, who was only a poor man of the middle-classes, had an\\r\\ninspiration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make your Fire Assurance pay for it. The companies pay for all articles\\r\\nthat are burnt, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this advice the little woman calmed down immediately, and\\r\\nthen, after a moment\\'s reflection, she said to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, before going to your office, you will go to the _Maternelle_\\r\\nAssurance Company, show them the state your umbrella is in, and make\\r\\nthem pay for the damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Oreille fairly jumped, he was so startled at the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not do it for my life! It is eighteen francs lost that is all.\\r\\nIt will not ruin us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he took a walking-stick when he went out, and, luckily,\\r\\nit was a fine day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft at home alone, Mme. Oreille could not get over the loss of her\\r\\neighteen francs by any means. She had put the umbrella on the\\r\\ndining-room table, and she looked at it without being able to come to\\r\\nany determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment she thought of the Assurance Company, but she did not dare\\r\\nto encounter the quizzical looks of the gentlemen who might receive her,\\r\\nfor she was very timid before people, and grew red at a mere nothing,\\r\\nand was embarrassed when she had to speak to strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she\\r\\nhad been wounded. She tried not to think of it any more, and yet every\\r\\nmoment the recollection of the loss struck her painfully. What was she\\r\\nto do, however? Time went on, and she could not decide; but suddenly,\\r\\nlike all cowards, on becoming determined, she made up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go, and we will see what will happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the\\r\\ndisaster might be complete, and the reason of it quite evident. She took\\r\\na match from the mantelpiece, and between the ribs she burnt a hole as\\r\\nbig as the palm of her hand; then she delicately rolled it up, fastened\\r\\nit with the elastic band, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quickly\\r\\ntowards the Rue de Rivoli, where the Assurance Office was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the nearer she got the slower she walked. What was she going to say,\\r\\nand what reply would she get?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the numbers of the houses; there were still twenty-eight.\\r\\nThat was all right, so she had time to consider, and she walked slower\\r\\nand slower. Suddenly she saw a door on which was a large brass plate\\r\\nwith \"_La Maternelle_ Fire Assurance Office\" engraved on it. Already!\\r\\nShe waited for a moment, for she felt nervous and almost ashamed; then\\r\\nshe went past, came back, went past again, and came back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she said to herself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go in, however, so I may as well do it sooner as later.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not help noticing, however, how her heart beat as she entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went into an enormous room with grated wicket openings all round,\\r\\nand a man behind each of them, and as a gentleman, carrying a number of\\r\\npapers, passed her, she stopped him and said, timidly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, Monsieur, but can you tell me where I must apply for\\r\\npayment for anything that has been accidentally burnt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a sonorous voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first door on the left; that is the department you want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis frightened her still more, and she felt inclined to run away, to\\r\\nmake no claim, to sacrifice her eighteen francs. But the idea of that\\r\\nsum revived her courage, and she went upstairs, out of breath, stopping\\r\\nat almost every other step.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knocked at a door which she saw on the first landing, and a clear\\r\\nvoice said, in answer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three\\r\\nsolemn gentlemen, all with a decoration in their buttonholes, were\\r\\nstanding talking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them asked her: \"What do you want, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly get out her words, but stammered: \"I have come--I have\\r\\ncome on account of an accident, something--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe very politely pointed out a seat to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will kindly sit down I will attend to you in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, returning to the other two, he went on with the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Company, gentlemen, does not consider that it is under any\\r\\nobligation to you for more than four hundred thousand francs, and we can\\r\\npay no attention to your claim to the further sum of a hundred thousand,\\r\\nwhich you wish to make us pay. Besides that, the surveyor\\'s valuation--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the others interrupted him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite enough, Monsieur; the Law Courts will decide between us,\\r\\nand we have nothing further to do than to take your leave.\" And they\\r\\nwent out after mutual ceremonious bows.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If she could only have gone away with them, how gladly she would\\r\\nhave done it; she would have run away and given up everything. But it\\r\\nwas too late, for the gentleman came back, and said, bowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for you, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could scarcely speak, but at last she managed to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come--for this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager looked at the object which she held out to him in mute\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith trembling fingers she tried to undo the elastic, and succeeded,\\r\\nafter several attempts, and hastily opened the damaged remains of the\\r\\numbrella.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks to me to be in a very bad state of health,\" he said,\\r\\ncompassionately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It cost me twenty francs,\" she said, with some hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished. \"Really! As much as that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was a capital article, and I wanted you to see the state it is\\r\\nin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, I see; very well. But I really do not understand what it can\\r\\nhave to do with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this Company did not pay for\\r\\nsuch small articles, and she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--it is burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not deny it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that very well,\" he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained open-mouthed, not knowing what to say next; then suddenly\\r\\nforgetting that she had left out the main thing, she said hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Mme. Oreille; we are assured in _La Maternelle_, and I have come\\r\\nto claim the value of this damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to have it re-covered,\" she added quickly, fearing a\\r\\npositive refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager was rather embarrassed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, really, Madame, we do not sell umbrellas; we cannot undertake such\\r\\nkinds of repairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little woman felt her courage reviving; she was not going to give up\\r\\nwithout a struggle; she was not even afraid any more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to pay me the cost of repairing it; I can quite well\\r\\nget it done myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman seemed rather confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Madame, it is such a very small matter! We are never asked to\\r\\ngive compensation for such trivial losses. You must allow that we cannot\\r\\nmake good pocket-handkerchiefs, gloves, brooms, slippers, all the small\\r\\narticles which are every day exposed to the chances of being burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red, and felt inclined to fly into a rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Monsieur, last December one of our chimneys caught fire, and\\r\\ncaused at least five hundred francs\\' damage; M. Oreille made no claim on\\r\\nthe Company, and so it is only just that it should pay for my umbrella\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager, guessing that she was telling a lie, said, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must acknowledge, Madame, that it is very surprising that M.\\r\\nOreille should have asked no compensation for damages amounting to five\\r\\nhundred francs, and should now claim five or six francs for mending an\\r\\numbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not the least put out, and replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg pardon, Monsieur, the five hundred francs affected M. Oreille\\'s\\r\\npocket, whereas this damage, amounting to eighteen francs, concerns Mme.\\r\\nOreille\\'s pocket only, which is a totally different matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he saw that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would\\r\\nonly be wasting his time, he said, resignedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you kindly tell me how the damage was done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt that she had won the victory, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is how it happened, Monsieur: In our hall there is a bronze\\r\\nstick-and umbrella-stand, and the other day, when I came in, I put my\\r\\numbrella into it. I must tell you that just above there is a shelf for\\r\\nthe candlesticks and matches. I put out my hand, took three or four\\r\\nmatches, and struck one, but it missed fire, so I struck another, which\\r\\nignited, but went out immediately, and a third did the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager interrupted her, to make a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose they were Government matches, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not understand him, and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely. At any rate, the fourth caught fire, and I lit my candle,\\r\\nand went into my room to go to bed; but in a quarter-of-an-hour I\\r\\nfancied that I smelt something burning, and I have always been terribly\\r\\nafraid of fire. If ever we have an accident it will not be my fault, I\\r\\nassure you. I am terribly nervous since our chimney was on fire, as I\\r\\ntold you; so I got up, and hunted about everywhere, sniffing like a dog\\r\\nafter game, and at last I noticed that my umbrella was burning. Most\\r\\nlikely a match had fallen between the folds and burnt it. You can see\\r\\nhow it has damaged it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager had taken his clue, and asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you estimate the damage at?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not know what to say, as she was not certain what amount to put\\r\\non it, but at last she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you had better get it done yourself. I will leave it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, naturally refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Madame, I cannot do that. Tell me the amount of your claim, that is\\r\\nall I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!--I think that--Look here, Monsieur, I do not want to make any\\r\\nmoney out of you, so I will tell you what we will do. I will take my\\r\\numbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it in good, durable silk, and\\r\\nI will bring the bill to you. Will that suit you, Monsieur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly, Madame; we will settle it so. Here is a note for the\\r\\ncashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave Mme. Oreille a slip of paper, who took it, got up and went out,\\r\\nthanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good\\r\\numbrella-maker, and when she found a shop which appeared to be a first\\r\\nclass one, she went in, and said, confidently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want this umbrella recovered in silk, good silk. Use the very best\\r\\nand strongest you have; I don\\'t mind what it costs.\"',\n"," 'MY UNCLE SOSTHENES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Uncle Sosthenes was a Freethinker, like so many others are, from pure\\r\\nstupidity; people are very often religious in the same way. The mere\\r\\nsight of a priest threw him into a violent rage; he shook his fist and\\r\\ngrimaced at him, and touched a piece of iron when the priest\\'s back was\\r\\nturned, forgetting that the latter action showed a belief after all, the\\r\\nbelief in the evil eye. Now when beliefs are unreasonable one should\\r\\nhave all or none at all. I myself am a Freethinker; I revolt at all the\\r\\ndogmas which have invented the fear of death, but I feel no anger\\r\\ntowards places of worship, be they Catholic, Apostolic, Roman,\\r\\nProtestant, Greek, Russian, Buddhist, Jewish, or Mohammedan. I have a\\r\\npeculiar manner of looking at them and explaining them. A place of\\r\\nworship represents the homage paid by man to THE UNKNOWN. The more\\r\\nextended our thoughts and our views become, the more _the unknown_\\r\\ndiminishes, and the more places of worship will decay. I, however, in\\r\\nthe place of church furniture, in the place of pulpits, reading desks,\\r\\naltars, and so on, would fit them up with telescopes, microscopes, and\\r\\nelectrical machines; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and I differed on nearly every point. He was a patriot, while I\\r\\nwas not, for after all patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg\\r\\nfrom which wars are hatched.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was a Freemason, and I used to declare that they are stupider\\r\\nthan old women devotees. That is my opinion, and I maintain it; if we\\r\\nmust have any religion at all the old one is good enough for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is their object? Mutual help to be obtained by tickling the palms\\r\\nof each other\\'s hands. I see no harm in it, for they put into practice\\r\\nthe Christian precept: \"Do unto others as ye would they should do unto\\r\\nyou.\" The only difference consists in the tickling, but it does not seem\\r\\nworth while to make such a fuss about lending a poor devil half-a-crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all my arguments my uncle\\'s reply used to be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are raising up a religion against a religion; Freethought will kill\\r\\nclericalism. Freemasonry is the headquarters of those who are\\r\\ndemolishing all deities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear uncle,\" I would reply (in my heart I felt inclined\\r\\nto say, \"You old idiot!\"); \"it is just that which I am blaming you for.\\r\\nInstead of destroying, you are organizing competition; it is only a case\\r\\nof lowering the prices. And then, if you only admitted Freethinkers\\r\\namong you I could understand it, but you admit anybody. You have a\\r\\nnumber of Catholics among you, even the leaders of the party. Pius IX.\\r\\nis said to have been one of you before he became Pope. If you call a\\r\\nsociety with such an organization a bulwark against clericalism, I think\\r\\nit is an extremely weak one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" my uncle would reply, with a wink, \"our most formidable\\r\\nactions are political; slowly and surely we are everywhere undermining\\r\\nthe monarchical spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I broke out: \"Yes, you are very clever! If you tell me that\\r\\nFreemasonry is an election-machine, I will grant it you. I will never\\r\\ndeny that it is used as a machine to control stove for candidates of\\r\\nall shades; if you say that it is only used to hoodwink people, to drill\\r\\nthem to go to the voting-urn as soldiers are sent under fire, I agree\\r\\nwith you; if you declare that it is indispensable to all political\\r\\nambitions because it changes all its members into electoral agents, I\\r\\nshould say to you, \\'That is as clear as the sun.\\' But when you tell me\\r\\nthat it serves to undermine the monarchical spirit, I can only laugh in\\r\\nyour face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just consider that vast and democratic association which had Prince\\r\\nNapoleon for its Grand Master under the Empire; which has the Crown\\r\\nPrince for its Grand Master in Germany, the Czar\\'s brother in Russia,\\r\\nand to which the Prince of Wales and King Humbert and nearly all the\\r\\nroyalists of the globe belong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right,\" my uncle said; \"but all these persons are serving\\r\\nour projects without guessing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt inclined to tell him he was talking a pack of nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, however, indeed a sight to see my uncle when he had a Freemason\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn meeting they shook hands in a manner that was irresistibly funny; one\\r\\ncould see that they were going through a series of secret mysterious\\r\\npressures. When I wished to put my uncle in a rage, I had only to tell\\r\\nhim that dogs also have a manner which savors very much of Freemasonry,\\r\\nwhen they greet one another on meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen my uncle would take his friend into a corner to tell him something\\r\\nimportant, and at dinner they had a peculiar way of looking at each\\r\\nother, and of drinking to each other, in a manner as if to say: \"We know\\r\\nall about it, don\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to think that there are millions on the face of the globe who are\\r\\namused at such monkey tricks! I would sooner be a Jesuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in our town there really was an old Jesuit who was my uncle\\'s\\r\\ndetestation. Every time he met him, or if he only saw him at a distance,\\r\\nhe used to say: \"Go on, you toad!\" And then, taking my arm, he would\\r\\nwhisper to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, that fellow will play me a trick some day or other, I feel\\r\\nsure of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle spoke quite truly, and this was how it happened and through my\\r\\nfault also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a\\r\\ndinner on Good Friday, a real dinner with his favorite chitterlings and\\r\\nblackpuddings. I resisted as much as I could, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall eat meat on that day, but at home, quite by myself. Your\\r\\n_manifestation_, as you call it, is an idiotic idea. Why should you\\r\\nmanifest? What does it matter to you if people do not eat any meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my uncle would not be persuaded. He asked three of his friends to\\r\\ndine with him at one of the best restaurants in the town, and as he was\\r\\ngoing to pay the bill, I had certainly, after all, no scruples about\\r\\n_manifesting_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt four o\\'clock we took a conspicuous place in the most frequented\\r\\nrestaurant in the town, and my uncle ordered dinner in a loud voice for\\r\\nsix o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat down punctually, and at ten o\\'clock he had not finished yet. Five\\r\\nof us had drunk eighteen bottles of fine still wines, and four of\\r\\nchampagne. Then my uncle proposed what he was in the habit of calling:\\r\\n\"The archbishop\\'s turn.\" Each man put six small glasses in front of him,\\r\\neach of them filled with a different liquor, and then they had all to be\\r\\nemptied at one gulp, one after another, while one of the waiters counted\\r\\ntwenty. It was very stupid, but my uncle thought it was very suitable to\\r\\nthe occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven o\\'clock he was as drunk as a fly. So we had to take him home\\r\\nin a cab and put him to bed, and one could easily foresee that his\\r\\nanti-clerical demonstration would end in a terrible fit of indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was going back to my lodgings, being rather drunk myself, with a\\r\\ncheerful Machiavelian drunkenness which quite satisfied all my instincts\\r\\nof skepticism, an idea struck me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI arranged my necktie, put on a look of great distress, and went and\\r\\nrang loudly at the old Jesuit\\'s door. As he was deaf he made me wait a\\r\\nlong while, but at length he appeared at his window in a cotton nightcap\\r\\nand asked what I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shouted out at the top of my voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make haste, reverend Sir, and open the door; a poor, despairing, sick\\r\\nman is in need of your spiritual ministrations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good, kind man put on his trousers as quickly as he could, and came\\r\\ndown without his cassock. I told him in a breathless voice that my\\r\\nuncle, the Freethinker, had been taken suddenly ill, and fearing it was\\r\\ngoing to be something serious he had been seized with a sudden fear of\\r\\ndeath, and wished to see him and talk to him; to have his advice and\\r\\ncomfort, to make his peace with the Church, and to confess, so as to be\\r\\nable to cross the dreaded threshold at peace with himself; and I added\\r\\nin a mocking tone:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate he wishes it, and if it does him no good it can do him no\\r\\nharm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Jesuit, who was startled, delighted, and almost trembling, said\\r\\nto me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a moment, my son, I will come with you;\" but I replied: \"Pardon\\r\\nme, reverend Father, if I do not go with you; but my convictions will\\r\\nnot allow me to do so. I even refused to come and fetch you; so I beg\\r\\nyou not to say that you have seen me, but to declare that you had a\\r\\npresentiment--a sort of revelation of his illness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest consented, and went off quickly, knocked at my uncle\\'s door,\\r\\nand was soon let in; and I saw the black cassock disappear within that\\r\\nstronghold of Freethought.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hid under a neighboring gateway to wait for events. Had he been well,\\r\\nmy uncle would have half-murdered the Jesuit, but I knew that he would\\r\\nscarcely be able to move an arm, and I asked myself, gleefully, what\\r\\nsort of a scene would take place between these antagonists, what\\r\\nexplanation would be given? and what would be the issue of the situation\\r\\nwhich my uncle\\'s indignation would render more tragic still?\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed till I had to hold my sides, and said to myself, half aloud:\\r\\n\"Oh! what a joke, what a joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile it was getting very cold, and I noticed that the Jesuit stayed\\r\\na long time, and thought: \"They are having an explanation, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, two, three hours passed, and still the reverend Father did not come\\r\\nout. What had happened? Had my uncle died in a fit when he saw him, or\\r\\nhad he killed the cassocked gentleman? Perhaps they had mutually\\r\\ndevoured each other? This last supposition appeared very unlikely, for\\r\\nI fancied that my uncle was quite incapable of swallowing a grain more\\r\\nnourishment at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the day broke.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very uneasy, and, not venturing to go into the house myself, I\\r\\nwent to one of my friends who lived opposite. I knocked him up,\\r\\nexplained matters to him, much to his amusement and astonishment, and\\r\\ntook possession of his window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine o\\'clock he relieved me, and I got a little sleep. At two o\\'clock\\r\\nI, in my turn, replaced him. We were utterly astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six o\\'clock the Jesuit left, with a very happy and satisfied look on\\r\\nhis face, and we saw him go away with a quiet step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, timid and ashamed, I went and knocked at my uncle\\'s door; and when\\r\\nthe servant opened it I did not dare to ask her any questions, but went\\r\\nupstairs without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was lying pale, exhausted, with weary, sorrowful eyes and heavy\\r\\narms, on his bed. A little religious picture was fastened to one of the\\r\\nbed-curtains with a pin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, uncle,\" I said, \"you in bed still? Are you not well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a feeble voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear boy, I have been very ill, nearly dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was that, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know; it was most surprising. But, what is stranger still is,\\r\\nthat the Jesuit priest who has just left--you know, that excellent man\\r\\nwhom I have made such fun of--had a divine revelation of my state, and\\r\\ncame to see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, and with\\r\\ndifficulty said: \"Oh, really!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he came. He heard a Voice telling him to get up and come to me,\\r\\nbecause I was going to die. It was a revelation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pretended to sneeze, so as not to burst out laughing; I felt inclined\\r\\nto roll on the ground with amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about a minute I managed to say, indignantly: \"And you received him,\\r\\nuncle, you? You, a Freethinker, a Freemason? You did not have him thrown\\r\\nout-of-doors?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen a moment, it is so astonishing--so astonishing and providential!\\r\\nHe also spoke to me about my father; it seems he knew him formerly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father, uncle? But that is no reason for receiving a Jesuit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that, but I was very ill, and he looked after me most devotedly\\r\\nall night long. He was perfect; no doubt he saved my life; those men are\\r\\nall a little bit of a doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! he looked after you all night? But you said just now that he had\\r\\nonly been gone a very short time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite true; I kept him to breakfast after all his kindness. He\\r\\nhad it at a table by my bedside while I drank a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he ate meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle looked vexed, as if I had said something very much out of\\r\\nplace, and then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t joke, Gaston; such things are out of place at times. He has shown\\r\\nme more devotion than many a relation would have done, and I expect to\\r\\nhave his convictions respected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather upset me, but I answered, nevertheless: \"Very well, uncle;\\r\\nand what did you do after breakfast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We played a game of bezique, and then he repeated his breviary while I\\r\\nread a little book which he happened to have in his pocket, and which\\r\\nwas not by any means badly written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A religious book, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and no, or rather--no. It is the history of their missions in\\r\\nCentral Africa, and is rather a book of travels and adventures. What\\r\\nthese men have done is very grand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to feel that matters were going badly, so I got up. \"Well,\\r\\ngood-bye, uncle,\" I said, \"I see you are going to leave Freemasonry for\\r\\nreligion; you are a renegade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still rather confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but religion is a sort of Freemasonry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When is your Jesuit coming back?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t--I don\\'t know exactly; to-morrow, perhaps; but it is not\\r\\ncertain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out, altogether overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy joke turned out very badly for me! My uncle became radically\\r\\nconverted, and if that had been all I should not have cared so much.\\r\\nClerical or Freemason, to me it is all the same; six of one and\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen of the other; but the worst of it is that he has just made\\r\\nhis will--yes, made his will--and he has disinherited me in favor of\\r\\nthat rascally Jesuit!',\n"," 'HE?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear friend, you cannot understand it by any possible means, you say,\\r\\nand I perfectly believe you. You think I am going mad? It may be so, but\\r\\nnot for the reasons which you suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I am going to get married, and I will give you what has led me to\\r\\ntake that step.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy ideas and my convictions have not changed at all. I look upon all\\r\\nlegalized cohabitation as utterly stupid, for I am certain that nine\\r\\nhusbands out of ten are cuckolds; and they get no more than their\\r\\ndeserts for having been idiotic enough to fetter their lives, and\\r\\nrenounce their freedom in love, the only happy and good thing in the\\r\\nworld, and for having clipped the wings of fancy, which continually\\r\\ndrives us on towards all women, &c., &c., &c. You know what I mean. More\\r\\nthan ever I feel that I am incapable of loving one woman alone, because\\r\\nI shall always adore all the others too much. I should like to have a\\r\\nthousand arms, a thousand mouths, and a thousand--_temperaments_, to be\\r\\nable to strain an army of these charming creatures in my embrace at the\\r\\nsame moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet I am going to get married!\\r\\n\\r\\nI may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my\\r\\nwife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that\\r\\nthere is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my\\r\\npurpose. She is small, fair, and stout; so of course the day after\\r\\nto-morrow I shall ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is not rich, and belongs to the middle-classes. She is a girl such\\r\\nas you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any\\r\\napparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say\\r\\nof her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,\" and to-morrow they will say: \"What\\r\\na very nice woman Madame Raymon is.\" She belongs, in a word, to that\\r\\nimmense number of girls whom one is glad to have for one\\'s wife till the\\r\\nmoment comes, when one discovers that one happens to prefer all the\\r\\nother women to that particular woman whom one has married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" you will say to me, \"what on earth did you get married for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason\\r\\nthat urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am\\r\\nfrightened of being alone!\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state\\r\\nof mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not want to be alone any longer at night; I want to feel that there\\r\\nis someone close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say\\r\\nsomething, no matter what it be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able\\r\\nto ask some sudden question, a stupid question even if I feel inclined,\\r\\nso that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking\\r\\nsoul close to me, someone whose reason is at work; so that when I\\r\\nhastily light the candle I may see some human face by my\\r\\nside--because--because--I am ashamed to confess it--because I am afraid\\r\\nof being alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! you don\\'t understand me yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room I\\r\\nshould kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I\\r\\nbelieve in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I\\r\\nbelieve in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from\\r\\nthe face of this earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell,--yes, well, it must be told; I am afraid of myself, afraid of that\\r\\nhorrible sensation of incomprehensible fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I\\r\\nam afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects, which\\r\\nare animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above\\r\\nall, I am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems\\r\\nas if it were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and\\r\\ninvisible agony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind which causes a cold shiver\\r\\nto run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be seen,\\r\\nand I wish there were something there, no matter what, as long as it\\r\\nwere something tangible: I am frightened, merely because I cannot\\r\\nunderstand my own terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I\\r\\nknow not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or\\r\\nunder my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and\\r\\nI turn round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although\\r\\nthere is nothing there, and I know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get agitated; I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself up\\r\\nin my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes, and there,\\r\\ncowering down rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and remain\\r\\nthus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight on the\\r\\ntable by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet--I dare not\\r\\ndo it!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly I felt nothing of all that; I came home quite comfortably, and\\r\\nwent up and down in my rooms without anything disturbing my calmness of\\r\\nmind. Had anyone told me that I should be attacked by a malady--for I\\r\\ncan call it nothing else--of most improbable fear, such a stupid and\\r\\nterrible malady as it is, I should have laughed outright. I was\\r\\ncertainly never afraid of opening the door in the dark; I went to bed\\r\\nslowly without locking it, and never got up in the middle of the night\\r\\nto make sure that everything was firmly closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began last year in a very strange manner, on a damp autumn evening.\\r\\nWhen my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself\\r\\nwhat I was going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time,\\r\\nfeeling tired without any reason for it, unable to work, and even\\r\\nwithout energy to read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a\\r\\nprey to one of those fits of despondency, without any apparent cause\\r\\nwhich makes us feel inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so\\r\\nas to shake off our depressing thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than\\r\\nthey had ever done before, while I was surrounded by a sensation of\\r\\ninfinite and overwhelming solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but\\r\\nthen a kind of nervous impatience agitated my legs, so I got up and\\r\\nbegan to walk about again. I was rather feverish, for my hands, which I\\r\\nhad clasped behind me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost\\r\\nseemed to burn one another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my\\r\\nback, and I thought the damp air might have penetrated into my room, so\\r\\nI lit the fire for the first time that year, and sat down again and\\r\\nlooked at the flames. But soon I felt that I could not possibly remain\\r\\nquiet, and so I got up again and determined to go out, to pull myself\\r\\ntogether, and to find a friend to bear me company.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not find anyone, so I went on to the boulevards to try and meet\\r\\nsome acquaintance or other there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the\\r\\ngaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay\\r\\nheavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light from the lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on slowly, saying to myself, \"I shall not find a soul to talk\\r\\nto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced into several cafés, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg\\r\\nPoissonière, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the\\r\\ntables, who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the\\r\\nrefreshments they had ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I\\r\\nstarted off for home; I was very calm and very tired. My concierge[9]\\r\\nopened the door at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought\\r\\nthat another lodger had no doubt just come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it\\r\\nmerely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had\\r\\nbeen brought up for me in the course of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, and found my fire still burning, so that it lighted up the\\r\\nroom a little, and, in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed somebody\\r\\nsitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his back\\r\\ntowards me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought very naturally\\r\\nthat some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, whom\\r\\nI had told when I went out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I\\r\\nremembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had\\r\\nbeen opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched, and not\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone\\r\\nto sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw\\r\\nhim quite clearly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were\\r\\ncrossed, while his head, which was somewhat inclined to the left of the\\r\\narmchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. \"Who can it be?\" I\\r\\nasked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather dark, so I\\r\\nput out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in contact\\r\\nwith the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if some\\r\\nterrible danger had suddenly appeared in my way; then I turned round\\r\\nagain, impelled by some imperious desire of looking at the armchair\\r\\nagain, and I remained standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that\\r\\nI could not collect my thoughts, and ready to drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: \"It is a mere\\r\\nhallucination, that is all,\" and I immediately began to reflect about\\r\\nthis phenomenon. Thoughts fly very quickly at such moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been suffering from a hallucination, that was an incontestable\\r\\nfact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and\\r\\nlogically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only\\r\\nmy eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those\\r\\nvisions which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous\\r\\naccident to the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather\\r\\ncongested, perhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in so doing, I\\r\\nnoticed that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if\\r\\nsomebody had touched me from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly not by any means quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I double-locked my door, and felt rather reassured; now, at any\\r\\nrate, nobody could come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down again, and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I\\r\\nwent to bed, and blew out my light.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but then an\\r\\nirresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned on to\\r\\nmy side.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light\\r\\non to the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken, for there was nothing\\r\\nthere; I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to\\r\\nget to sleep as the room was now dark, but I had not forgotten myself\\r\\nfor more than five minutes when in my dream I saw all the scene which I\\r\\nhad witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up with a start,\\r\\nand having lit the candle, I sat up in bed, without venturing even to\\r\\ntry and go to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself,\\r\\nand twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad;\\r\\nwhen day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept\\r\\npeacefully till noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare; I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what. I had been ill, in a word, but yet I thought that I was\\r\\na great fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening; I went and dined at a\\r\\nrestaurant; afterwards I went to the theater, and then started home. But\\r\\nas I got near the house I was seized by a strange feeling of uneasiness\\r\\nonce more; I was afraid of _seeing_ him again. I was not afraid of him,\\r\\nnot afraid of his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid\\r\\nof being deceived again; I was afraid of some fresh hallucination,\\r\\nafraid lest fear should take possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then I\\r\\nthought that I was really too foolish, and at last I returned home. I\\r\\npanted so that I could scarcely get upstairs, and I remained standing\\r\\noutside my door for more than ten minutes; then suddenly I took courage,\\r\\nand screwed myself together. I inserted my key into the lock, and went\\r\\nin with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my half-open bedroom door,\\r\\nand gave a frightened look towards the fireplace; there was nothing\\r\\nthere. A--h!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a relief and what a delight! What a deliverance! I walked up and\\r\\ndown briskly and boldly, but I was not altogether reassured, and kept\\r\\nturning round with a jump; the very shadows in the corner disquieted me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but I\\r\\ndid not see _him_; no, that was all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that\\r\\nthe specter is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to\\r\\nme again. And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not\\r\\nbelieve in it, and know that it is nothing?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt still worries me, however, because I am constantly thinking of it:\\r\\n_his right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man\\r\\nwho was asleep_.... Enough of that, in Heaven\\'s name! I don\\'t want to\\r\\nthink about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, however, am I so persistently possessed with this idea? His feet\\r\\nwere close to the fire!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe haunts me; it is very stupid, but so it is. Who and what is HE? I\\r\\nknow that he does not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my\\r\\nfears, and in my agony! There--enough of that!...\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, _to stiffen\\r\\nmyself_, so to say; but I cannot remain at home, because I know he is\\r\\nthere. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again;\\r\\nthat is all over. But he is there all the same in my thoughts. He\\r\\nremains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is\\r\\nbehind the doors, in the closed cupboards, in the wardrobe, under the\\r\\nbed, in every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take\\r\\nthe candle to look under the bed and throw a light on to the dark\\r\\nplaces, he is there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn\\r\\nround, certain that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him\\r\\nagain; but he is, for all that, none the less behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very stupid, it is dreadful; but what am I to do? I cannot help\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if there were two of us in the place, I feel certain that he would\\r\\nnot be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone; simply\\r\\nand solely because I am alone!',\n"," 'A PHILOSOPHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot had been my most intimate friend from childhood; we had no\\r\\nsecrets from each other, and were united heart and soul by a brotherly\\r\\nintimacy and a boundless confidence in each other, and I had been\\r\\nintrusted with the secret of all his love affairs, as he had been with\\r\\nmine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he told me that he was going to get married I was hurt, just as if\\r\\nhe had been guilty of a treacherous act with regard to me. I felt that\\r\\nit must interfere with that cordial and absolute affection which had\\r\\nunited us hitherto. His wife would come between us. The intimacy of the\\r\\nmarriage-bed establishes a kind of complicity of mysterious alliance\\r\\nbetween two persons, even when they have ceased to love each other. Man\\r\\nand wife are like two discreet partners who will not let anyone else\\r\\ninto their secrets. But that close bond which the conjugal kiss fastens\\r\\nis widely loosened on the day on which the woman takes a lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember Blérot\\'s wedding as if it were but yesterday. I would not be\\r\\npresent at the signing of the marriage contract, as I have no particular\\r\\nliking for such ceremonies, but I only went to the civil wedding and to\\r\\nthe church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife, whom I had never seen before, was a tall, slight girl, with\\r\\npale hair, pale cheeks, pale hands, and eyes to match. She walked with a\\r\\nslightly undulating motion, as if she were on board a ship, and seemed\\r\\nto advance with a succession of long, graceful curtsies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot seemed very much in love with her. He looked at her constantly,\\r\\nand I felt a shiver of an immoderate desire for her pass through my\\r\\nframe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to see him in a few days, and he said to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not know how happy I am; I am madly in love with her; but then\\r\\nshe is ... she is ...\" He did not finish his sentence, but he put the\\r\\ntips of his fingers to his lips with a gesture which signified:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Divine! delicious! perfect!\" and a good deal more besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked, laughing, \"What! all that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything that you can imagine,\" was his answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe introduced me to her. She was very pleasant, on easy terms with me,\\r\\nas was natural, and begged me to look upon their house as my own. I felt\\r\\nthat he, Blérot, did not belong to me any longer. Our intimacy was\\r\\naltogether checked, and we hardly found a word to say to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon took my leave, and shortly afterwards went to the East, and\\r\\nreturned by way of Russia, Germany, Sweden, and Holland, after an\\r\\nabsence of eighteen months from Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after my arrival, as I was walking along the boulevards to\\r\\nbreathe the air once more, I saw a pale man with sunken cheeks coming\\r\\ntowards me, who was as much like Blérot as it was possible for a\\r\\nphysically emaciated man to be to a strong, ruddy, rather stout man. I\\r\\nlooked at him in surprise, and asked myself: \"Can it possibly be he?\"\\r\\nBut he saw me, and came towards me with outstretched arms, and we\\r\\nembraced in the middle of the boulevard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had gone up and down once or twice from the Rue Druot to the\\r\\nVaudeville Theater, just as we were taking leave of each other--for he\\r\\nalready seemed quite done up with walking--I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t look at all well. Are you ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do feel rather out of sorts,\" was all he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked like a man who was going to die, and I felt a flood of\\r\\naffection for my old friend, the only real one that I had ever had. I\\r\\nsqueezed his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you? Are you in pain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little tired; but it is nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does your doctor say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He calls it anæmia, and has ordered me to eat no white meat and to take\\r\\ntincture of iron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA suspicion flashed across me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you happy?\" I asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very happy; my wife is charming, and I love her more than ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I noticed that he grew rather red and seemed embarrassed, as if he\\r\\nwas afraid of any further questions, so I took him by the arm and pushed\\r\\nhim into a café, which was nearly empty at that time of day. I forced\\r\\nhim to sit down, and looking him straight in the face, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, old fellow, just tell me the exact truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing to tell you,\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not true,\" I replied firmly. \"You are ill, mentally perhaps,\\r\\nand you dare not reveal your secret to anyone. Something or other is\\r\\ndoing you harm, and I mean you to tell me what it is. Come, I am waiting\\r\\nfor you to begin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he got very red, stammered, and turning his head away, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very idiotic--but I--I am done for!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he did not go on, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I have got a wife who is killing me, that is all,\" he said\\r\\nabruptly, almost desperately.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not understand at first. \"Does she make you unhappy? How? What is\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he replied in a low voice, as if he were confessing some crime; \"I\\r\\nlove her too much, that is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thunderstruck at this brutal avowal, and then I felt inclined to\\r\\nlaugh, but at length I managed to reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, at least so it seems to me, you might manage to--to love\\r\\nher a little less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had got very pale again, and at length made up his mind to speak to\\r\\nme openly, as he used to do formerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"that is impossible; and I am dying from it I know; it is\\r\\nkilling me, and I am really frightened. Some days, like to-day, I feel\\r\\ninclined to leave her, to go away altogether, to start for the other end\\r\\nof the world, so as to live for a long time; and then, when the evening\\r\\ncomes, I return home in spite of myself, but slowly, and feeling\\r\\nuncomfortable. I go upstairs hesitatingly and ring, and when I go in I\\r\\nsee her there sitting in her easy chair, and she says, \\'How late you\\r\\nare,\\' I kiss her, and we sit down to dinner. During the meal I think to\\r\\nmyself: \\'I will go directly it is over, and take the train for\\r\\nsomewhere, no matter where;\\' but when we get back to the drawing-room I\\r\\nam so tired that I have not the courage to get up out of my chair, and\\r\\nso I remain, and then--and then--I succumb again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help smiling again. He saw it, and said: \"You may laugh, but\\r\\nI assure you it is very horrible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you tell your wife?\" I asked him. \"Unless she be a regular\\r\\nmonster she would understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"It is all very well for you to talk. I don\\'t\\r\\ntell her because I know her nature. Have you ever heard it said of\\r\\ncertain women, \\'She has just married a third time?\\' Well, and that makes\\r\\nyou laugh like you did just now, and yet it is true. What is to be done?\\r\\nIt is neither her fault nor mine. She is so, because nature has made her\\r\\nso; I assure you, my dear old friend, she has the temperament of a\\r\\nMessalina. She does not know it, but I do; so much the worse for me. She\\r\\nis charming, gentle, tender, and thinks that our conjugal intercourse,\\r\\nwhich is wearing me out and killing me, is natural and quite moderate.\\r\\nShe seems like an ignorant schoolgirl, and she really is ignorant, poor\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day I form energetic resolutions, for you must understand that I\\r\\nam dying. But one look of her eyes, one of those looks in which I can\\r\\nread the ardent desire of her lips, is enough for me, and I succumb at\\r\\nonce, saying to myself: \\'This is really the end; I will have no more of\\r\\nher death-giving kisses,\\' and then, when I have yielded again, like I\\r\\nhave to-day, I go out and walk on ahead, thinking of death, and saying\\r\\nto myself that I am lost, that all is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so mentally ill that I went for a walk to Père Lachaise cemetery\\r\\nyesterday. I looked at all the graves, standing in a row like dominoes,\\r\\nand I thought to myself: \\'I shall soon be there,\\' and then I returned\\r\\nhome, quite determined to pretend to be ill, and so escape, but I could\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! You don\\'t know what it is. Ask a smoker who is poisoning himself\\r\\nwith nicotine whether he can give up his delicious and deadly habit. He\\r\\nwill tell you that he has tried a hundred times without success, and he\\r\\nwill, perhaps, add: \\'So much the worse, but I had rather die than go\\r\\nwithout tobacco.\\' That is just the case with me. When once one is in the\\r\\nclutches of such a passion or such a vice, one must give oneself up to\\r\\nit entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and gave me his hand. I felt seized with a tumult of rage, and\\r\\nwith hatred for this woman, this careless, charming, terrible woman; and\\r\\nas he was buttoning up his coat to go out I said to him, brutally\\r\\nperhaps:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, in God\\'s name, why don\\'t you let her have a lover, rather than\\r\\nkill yourself like that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders without replying, and went off.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor six months I did not see him. Every morning I expected a letter of\\r\\ninvitation to his funeral, but I would not go to his house from a\\r\\ncomplicated feeling of contempt for him and for that woman; of anger, of\\r\\nindignation, of a thousand sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely spring morning I was walking in the Champs Elysées. It was\\r\\none of those warm days which makes our eyes bright and stir up in us a\\r\\ntumultuous feeling of happiness from the mere sense of existence.\\r\\nSomeone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I saw my old\\r\\nfriend, looking well, stout and rosy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me both hands, beaming with pleasure, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are, you erratic individual!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him, utterly thunderstruck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on my word--yes. By Jove! I congratulate you; you have indeed\\r\\nchanged in the last six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flushed scarlet, and said, with an embarrassed laugh:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One can but do one\\'s best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him so obstinately that he evidently felt uncomfortable, so\\r\\nI went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So--now--you are--completely cured?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stammered, hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, perfectly, thank you.\" Then changing his tone, \"How lucky that I\\r\\nshould have come across you, old fellow. I hope we shall often meet\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I would not give up my idea; I wanted to know how matters really\\r\\nstood, so I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you remember what you told me six months ago? I\\r\\nsuppose--I--eh--suppose you resist now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t talk any more about it,\" he replied, uneasily; \"forget\\r\\nthat I mentioned it to you; leave me alone. But, you know, I have no\\r\\nintention of letting you go; you must come and dine at my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden fancy took me to see for myself how matters stood, so that I\\r\\nmight understand all about it, and I accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife received me in a most charming manner, and she was, as a matter\\r\\nof fact, a most attractive woman. Her long hands, her neck and cheeks\\r\\nwere beautifully white and delicate, and marked her breeding, and her\\r\\nwalk was undulating and delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené gave her a brotherly kiss on the forehead and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has not Lucien come yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" she replied, in a clear, soft voice; \"you know he is almost\\r\\nalways rather late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the bell rang, and a tall man was shown in. He was dark,\\r\\nwith a thick beard, and looked like a modern Hercules. We were\\r\\nintroduced to each other; his name was Lucien Delabarre.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené and he shook hands in a most friendly manner, and then we went to\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a most enjoyable meal, without the least constraint. My old\\r\\nfriend spoke with me constantly, in the old familiar cordial manner,\\r\\njust as he used to do. It was: \"You know, old fellow!\"--\"I say, old\\r\\nfellow!\"--\"Just listen a moment, old fellow!\" Suddenly he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know how glad I am to see you again; it takes me back to old\\r\\ntimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at his wife and the other man. Their attitude was perfectly\\r\\ncorrect, though I fancied once or twice that they exchanged a rapid and\\r\\nfurtive look.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as dinner was over René turned to his wife, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, I have just met Pierre again, and I am going to carry him off\\r\\nfor a walk and a chat along the boulevards to remind us of old times. I\\r\\nam leaving you in very good company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman smiled, and said to me, as she shook hands with me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep him too long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we went along, arm-in-arm, I could not help saying to him, for I was\\r\\ndetermined to know how matters stood:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, what has happened? Do tell me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, interrupted me roughly, and answered like a man who has\\r\\nbeen disturbed without any reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look here, old fellow leave one alone with your questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he added, half aloud, as if talking to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, it would have been too stupid to have let oneself go to pot\\r\\nlike that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not press him. We walked on quickly and began to talk. All of a\\r\\nsudden he whispered in my ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, suppose we go and have a bottle of \\'fizz\\' with some girls! Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not prevent myself from laughing heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you like; come along, let us go.\"',\n"," 'ALWAYS LOCK THE DOOR!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four glasses which were standing in front of the diners were now\\r\\nstill nearly half full, which is a sign, as a general rule, that the\\r\\nguests are quite so. They were beginning to speak without waiting for an\\r\\nanswer; no one took any notice of anything except what was going on\\r\\ninside him, either in his mind or stomach; voices grew louder, gestures\\r\\nmore animated, eyes brighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bachelors\\' dinner of confirmed old bachelors. They had\\r\\ninstituted this regular banquet twenty years before, christening it \"The\\r\\nCelibate,\" and at the time there were fourteen of them, all fully\\r\\ndetermined never to marry. Now there were only four of them left; three\\r\\nwere dead and the other seven were married.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four stuck firmly to it, and, as far as lay in their power, they\\r\\nscrupulously observed the rules which had been laid down at the\\r\\nbeginning of their curious association. They had sworn, hand-in-hand, to\\r\\nturn aside every woman they could from the right path, and their\\r\\nfriends\\' wives for choice, and more especially those of their most\\r\\nintimate friends. For this reason, as soon as any of them left the\\r\\nsociety, in order to set up in domestic life for himself, he took care\\r\\nto quarrel definitely with all his former companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this, they were pledged at every dinner to relate most minutely\\r\\ntheir last adventures, which had given rise to this familiar phrase\\r\\namongst them:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To lie like an old bachelor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey professed, moreover, the most profound contempt for woman whom they\\r\\ntalked of as an animal made solely for their pleasure. Every moment they\\r\\nquoted Schopenhauer, who was their god, and his well-known essay \"On\\r\\nWomen;\" they wished that harems and towers might be reintroduced, and\\r\\nhad the ancient maxim: \"Mulier, perpetuus infans,\"[10] woven into their\\r\\ntable-linen, and below it, the line of Alfred de Vigny\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n_La femme, enfant malade et douze fois impure._[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that by dint of despising women they lived only for them, while all\\r\\ntheir efforts and all their desires were directed towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of them who had married called them old fops, made fun of them,\\r\\nand--feared them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they began to feel the exhilarating effects of the champagne, this\\r\\nwas the moment that their old bachelor experiences began.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day in question, these old fellows, for they were old by this\\r\\ntime, and the older they got the more extraordinary _good fortune_ in\\r\\nthe way of love affairs they had to relate, were quite inexhaustible.\\r\\nFor the last month, to hear them, each of them had played the gallant\\r\\nwith at least one woman a day; and what women! the youngest, the\\r\\nnoblest, the richest, and the most beautiful!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had finished their tales, one of them, he who having spoken\\r\\nfirst had been obliged to listen to all the others, rose and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now that we have finished drawing the long-bow, I should like to tell\\r\\nyou, not my last, but my first adventure,--I mean the first adventure\\r\\nof my life, my first fall,--for it is a moral fall after all, in the\\r\\narms of Venus. Oh! I am not going to tell you my first--what shall I\\r\\ncall it?--my first appearance; certainly not. The leap over the first\\r\\nhedge (I am speaking figuratively) has nothing interesting about it. It\\r\\nis generally rather a disagreeable one, and one picks oneself up rather\\r\\nabashed, with one charming illusion the less, with a vague feeling of\\r\\ndisappointment and sadness. That _realization_ of love the first time\\r\\none experiences it is rather repugnant; we had dreamt of it as being so\\r\\ndifferent, so delicate, so refined. It leaves a physical and moral sense\\r\\nof disgust behind it, just like as when one has happened to have put\\r\\none\\'s hand into some clammy matter and feels in a hurry to _wash_ it\\r\\noff. You may _rub_ it as hard as you like, but the moral feeling\\r\\nremains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! but one very soon gets quite used to it; there is no doubt about\\r\\nthat. For my part, however, I am very sorry it was not in my power to\\r\\ngive the Creator the benefit of my advice when He was arranging these\\r\\nlittle matters. I wonder what _I_ should have done? I am not quite sure,\\r\\nbut I think with the English savant, John Stuart Mill, I should have\\r\\nmanaged differently; I should have found some more convenient and more\\r\\npoetical combination; yes--more poetical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really think that the Creator showed Himself to be too much of a\\r\\nnaturalist ... too ... what shall I say? His invention lacks poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, what I am going to tell you is about my first woman of the\\r\\nworld, the first woman in society I ever made love to;--I beg your\\r\\npardon, I ought to say the first woman of the world that ever triumphed\\r\\nover me. For at first it is _we_ who allow ourselves to be taken, while,\\r\\nlater on--well, then it is quite another matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was a friend of my mother\\'s, a charming woman in every way. When\\r\\nsuch women are chaste, it is generally from sheer stupidity, and when\\r\\nthey are in love they are furiously so. And then--_we_ are accused of\\r\\ncorrupting _them_! Yes, yes, of course! With them it is always the\\r\\nrabbit that begins and never the sportsman. I know all about it; they\\r\\ndon\\'t seem to put their fingers near us, but they do it all the same,\\r\\nand do what they like with us, without it being noticed, and then they\\r\\nactually accuse us of having ruined them, dishonored them, humiliated\\r\\nthem, and all the rest of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The woman in question certainly had a great desire to be humiliated by\\r\\nme. She may have been about thirty-five, while I was scarcely\\r\\ntwo-and-twenty. I no more thought of dishonoring her than I did of\\r\\nturning Trappist. Well, one day when I was calling on her, and while I\\r\\nwas looking at her dress with considerable astonishment, for she had on\\r\\na morning wrapper which was open as wide as a church-door when the bells\\r\\nare ringing for service, she took my hand and squeezed it--squeezed it,\\r\\nyou know, like they will do at such moments--and said, with a deep sigh,\\r\\none of those sighs, you know, which come from right down the bottom of\\r\\nthe chest: \\'Oh! don\\'t look at me like that, child!\\' I got as red as a\\r\\ntomato, and felt more nervous than usual, naturally. I was very much\\r\\ninclined to bolt, but she held my hand tightly, and putting it onto her\\r\\nwell-developed bust, she said: \\'Just feel how my heart beats!\\' Of course\\r\\nit was beating, and I began to understand what was the matter, but I\\r\\ndid not know what to do. I have changed considerably since then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I remained standing there, with one hand on the soft covering of her\\r\\nheart, while I held my hat in the other, and continuing to look at her\\r\\nwith a confused, silly smile--a timid, frightened smile--she suddenly\\r\\ndrew back, and said in an irritated voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Young man, what are you doing? You are indecent and badly brought up.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be sure I took my hand away quickly, stopped smiling, and\\r\\nstammering out some excuse, I got up and took my leave as if I had lost\\r\\nmy head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was caught, and dreamt of her. I thought her charming, adorable;\\r\\nI fancied that I loved her, that I had always loved her, and I\\r\\ndetermined to see her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I saw her again she gave me a little smile like an actress might\\r\\nbehind the scenes. Oh, how that little smile upset me! And she shook\\r\\nhands with a long, significant pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From that day it seems that I made love to her; at least, she declared\\r\\nafterwards that I had ruined her, captured her, dishonored her, with\\r\\nrare Machiavelism, with consummate cleverness, with the perseverance of\\r\\na mathematician, and the cunning of an Apaché Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But one thing troubled me strangely; where was my triumph to be\\r\\naccomplished? I lived with my family, and on this point my family was\\r\\nmost particular. I was not bold enough to venture to go to an hotel in\\r\\nbroad daylight with a woman on my arm, and I did not know whom to ask\\r\\nfor advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my fair friend had often said in joke that every young man ought\\r\\nto have a room for himself somewhere or other from home. We lived in\\r\\nParis, and this was a sort of inspiration. I took a room, and she came.\\r\\nShe came one day in November; I should have liked to put off her visit\\r\\nbecause I had no fire, and I had no fire because the chimney smoked. The\\r\\nvery evening before, I had spoken to my landlord, a retired shopkeeper,\\r\\nabout it, and he had promised that he would send for the chimneysweep in\\r\\na day or two to get it all put to rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as she came in, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There is no fire because my chimney smokes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not even appear to hear me, but stammered: \\'That does not\\r\\nmatter, I have...;\\' and when I looked surprised, she stopped short in\\r\\nconfusion, and then went on: \\'I don\\'t know what I am saying; I am\\r\\nmad.... I have lost my head.... Oh! what am I doing? Why did I come? How\\r\\nunhappy I am! What a disgrace, what a disgrace!\\' And she threw herself\\r\\nsobbing into my arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought that she really felt remorse, and swore that I would respect\\r\\nher. Then, however, she sank down at my knees, sighing: \\'But don\\'t you\\r\\nsee that I love you, that you have overcome me, that it seems as though\\r\\nyou had thrown a charm over me?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I thought it was about time to show myself a man. But she\\r\\ntrembled, got up, ran and hid behind a wardrobe, crying out: \\'Oh! don\\'t\\r\\nlook at me; no! no! If only you did not see me, if we were only in the\\r\\ndark! I am ashamed in the light. Cannot you imagine it? What a dreadful\\r\\ndream! Oh! this light, this light!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I rushed to the window; I closed the outside shutters, drew the\\r\\ncurtains, and hung a coat over a ray of light that peeped in, and then,\\r\\nstretching out my hands so as not to fall over the chairs, with my heart\\r\\nbeating, and felt for her, and found her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a fresh journey for the two of us then, groping our way, with\\r\\nour hands united, towards the other corner where the sofa stood. I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose we went straight, for first of all I knocked against the\\r\\nmantelpiece, and then against a chest of drawers, before finding what we\\r\\nwanted. After we sat down I forgot everything, and we almost went to\\r\\nsleep in each other\\'s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was half dreaming; but in my dream I fancied that someone was calling\\r\\nme and crying for help; then I received a violent blow, and opened my\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'O--h!\\' The setting sun, magnificent and red, shone full into the room\\r\\nthrough the door, which was wide open, and seemed to look at us from the\\r\\nverge of the horizon, illuminating us both, especially my companion, who\\r\\nwas screaming, struggling, and twisting, and trying with hands and feet\\r\\nto get under the sofa, while in the middle of the room stood my landlord\\r\\nby the side of the concierge[12] and a chimneysweep, as black as the\\r\\ndevil, who were looking at us with stupid eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood up in rage, ready to jump at his throat, and shouted:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What the deuce are you doing in my room?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimneysweep laughed so that he let his brush fall on the floor.\\r\\nThe porter looked as if he were going out of his mind, and the landlord\\r\\nstammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But, Monsieur, it was--it was--about the chimney--the chimney, the\\r\\nchimney which--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Go to the devil!\\' I roared. So he took off his hat, which he had kept\\r\\non in his confusion, and said, in a confused but very civil manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I beg your pardon, Monsieur; if I had known, I should not have\\r\\ndisturbed you; I should not have come. The concierge told me you had\\r\\ngone out. Pray excuse me.\\' And they all went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ever since that time I never draw the curtains but am always very\\r\\ncareful to lock the door first.\"',\n"," 'A MEETING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all an accident, a pure accident. Tired of standing, Baron\\r\\nd\\'Etraille went, as all the Princess\\'s rooms were open on that\\r\\nparticular evening, into an empty bedroom, which appeared almost dark\\r\\nafter coming out of the brilliantly lighted drawing-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his\\r\\nwife would not go away before daylight. As soon as he got inside the\\r\\ndoor he saw the big bed with its azure-and-gold hangings, in the middle\\r\\nof the great room, looking like a catafalque in which love was buried,\\r\\nfor the Princess was no longer young. Behind it, a large bright spot\\r\\nlooked like a lake seen at a distance from the window. It was a large\\r\\nlooking-glass, which, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that,\\r\\nhowever, was very rarely let down, seemed to look at the bed, which was\\r\\nits accomplice. One might almost fancy that it felt regrets, and that\\r\\none was going to see in it charming shapes of naked women, and the\\r\\ngentle movement of arms about to embrace them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron stood still for a moment, smiling, rather moved, on the\\r\\nthreshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly something\\r\\nappeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had evoked\\r\\nhad risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on a low\\r\\ncouch hidden in the shade had got up, and the polished surface,\\r\\nreflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other\\r\\nbefore separating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigné. He turned and\\r\\nwent away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited till it\\r\\nwas day before taking away the Baroness; but he had no longer any\\r\\nthoughts of sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they were alone he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame, I saw you just now in Princess de Raynes\\' room; I need say no\\r\\nmore, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of\\r\\nridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without\\r\\nany scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my\\r\\norders. You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer\\r\\nunder my roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn\\r\\nyou that, should any scandal arise, I shall show myself inflexible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to speak, but he stopped her, bowed, and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly\\r\\nduring the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,\\r\\nand now he often had a caprice, either in a theater or in society,\\r\\nthough he always preserved a certain liking for the Baroness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight--too\\r\\nslight--and very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoilt,\\r\\nelegant, coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to\\r\\nsay familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My wife is charming, attractive, but--there is nothing to lay hold of.\\r\\nShe is like a glass of champagne that is all froth--when you have got to\\r\\nthe wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked up and down the room in great agitation, and thinking of a\\r\\nthousand things. At one moment he felt in a great rage, and felt\\r\\ninclined to give the Marquis a good thrashing or to smack his face\\r\\npublicly, in the club. But he thought that would not do, it would not be\\r\\nat all _the thing_; he would be laughed at, and not the Marquis, and as\\r\\nhe felt that his anger proceeded more from wounded vanity than from a\\r\\nbroken heart he went to bed, but could not go to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days afterwards it was known in Paris that the Baron and Baroness\\r\\nd\\'Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of\\r\\nincompatibility of temper. Nobody suspected anything, nobody laughed,\\r\\nand nobody was astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron, however, to avoid meeting her, traveled for a year, then he\\r\\nspent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning\\r\\nto Paris for the winter. He did not meet his wife once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not even know what people said about her. At any rate, she took\\r\\ncare to save appearances, and that was all he asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got dreadfully bored, traveled again, restored his old castle of\\r\\nVillebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he received\\r\\nrelays of friends there, till at last, tired of all these commonplace,\\r\\nso-called pleasures, he returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lills,\\r\\njust six years after their separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was then forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and\\r\\nwith that melancholy look of people who have been handsome, sought\\r\\nafter, and much liked, and who are deteriorating daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month after his return to Paris he took cold on coming out of his\\r\\nclub, and had a bad cough, so his medical man ordered him to Nice for\\r\\nthe rest of the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started by the express on Monday evening. He was late, and got to the\\r\\nstation only a very short time before the departure of the train, and\\r\\nhad barely time to get into a carriage, with only one occupant, who was\\r\\nsitting in a corner so wrapped in furs and cloaks that he could not even\\r\\nmake out whether it were a man or a woman, as nothing of the figure\\r\\ncould be seen. When he perceived that he could not find out, he put on\\r\\nhis traveling-cap, rolled himself up in his rugs, and stretched himself\\r\\nout comfortably to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not wake up till the day was breaking, and looked immediately at\\r\\nhis fellow-traveler. He had not stirred all night, and seemed still to\\r\\nbe sound asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. d\\'Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his\\r\\nbeard, and to try and freshen himself up a little generally, for a\\r\\nnight\\'s traveling changes one\\'s looks very much when one has attained to\\r\\na certain age.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great poet has said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"When we are young, our mornings are triumphant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we wake up with a cool skin, a bright eye, and glossy hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one grows older one wakes up in a very different state. Dull eyes,\\r\\nred, swollen cheeks, dry lips, the hair and beard all disarranged,\\r\\nimpart an old, fatigued, wornout look to the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron opened his traveling dressing-case, and made himself as tidy\\r\\nas he could, and then he waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engine whistled and the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No\\r\\ndoubt he was awake. They started off again, and then an oblique ray of\\r\\nsun shone into the carriage just on to the sleeper, who moved again,\\r\\nshook himself, and then calmly showed his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a young, fair, pretty, stout woman, and the Baron looked at her\\r\\nin amazement. He did not know what to believe. He could really have\\r\\nsworn that it was--his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better:\\r\\nstouter--why she had grown as stout as he was--only it suited her much\\r\\nbetter than it did him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him quietly, did not seem to recognize him, and then\\r\\nslowly laid aside her wraps. She had that calm assurance of a woman who\\r\\nis sure of herself, the insolent audacity of a first awakening, knowing\\r\\nand feeling that she was in her full beauty and freshness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron really lost his head. Was it his wife, or somebody else who\\r\\nwas as like her as any sister could be? As he had not seen her for six\\r\\nyears he might be mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe yawned, and he knew her by her gesture, and she turned and looked at\\r\\nhim again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then\\r\\nlooked out at the country again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was upset and dreadfully perplexed, and waited, looking at her\\r\\nsideways, steadfastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; it was certainly his wife. How could he possibly have doubted?\\r\\nThere could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand\\r\\nrecollections flashed through him, slight details of her body, a\\r\\nbeauty-spot on one of her thighs, and another opposite to it on her\\r\\nback. How often he had kissed them! He felt the old feeling of the\\r\\nintoxication of love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet\\r\\nodor of her skin, her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders,\\r\\nthe soft intonations of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. He\\r\\nthought her riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more\\r\\ndesirable, adorably desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a\\r\\nrailway-carriage belonged to him; he had only to say to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I insist upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he\\r\\nhad found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.\\r\\nIt was another, and yet she at the same time. It was another who had\\r\\nbeen born, and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she,\\r\\nindeed; she whom he had possessed but who was now altered, with a more\\r\\nassured smile and greater self-possession. There were two women in one,\\r\\nmingling a great past of what was new and unknown with many sweet\\r\\nrecollections of the past. There was something singular, disturbing,\\r\\nexciting about it--a kind of mystery of love in which there floated a\\r\\ndelicious confusion. It was his wife in a new body and in new flesh\\r\\nwhich lips had never pressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he thought that in six years everything changes in us, only the\\r\\noutline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood, the hair, the skin all change, and is reconstituted, and when\\r\\npeople have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they\\r\\nfind another totally different being, although it be the same and bear\\r\\nthe same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so\\r\\nthat in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant\\r\\ntransformations, become four or five totally new and different beings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken\\r\\npossession of him when he surprised her in the Princess\\'s room. He was\\r\\nnot the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking\\r\\nat--that thin, excitable little doll of those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to\\r\\nher? Had she recognized him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: \"Bertha, do you\\r\\nwant anything I could bring you?...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the\\r\\nslightest surprise or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect\\r\\nindifference:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not want anything,--thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to\\r\\nrecover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall.\\r\\nWhat should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as\\r\\nif he were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would\\r\\nlook as if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were\\r\\nher master? He would look like a fool, and besides, he really had no\\r\\nright to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got in again and took his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was\\r\\nnow lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to her, and said: \"My dear Bertha, since this singular chance\\r\\nhas brought us together after a separation of six years--a quite\\r\\nfriendly separation--are we to continue to look upon each other as\\r\\nirreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, _tête-à-tête_, which is\\r\\nso much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into\\r\\nanother carriage, so don\\'t you think it is preferable to talk as friends\\r\\ntill the end of our journey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered quite calmly again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had\\r\\nplenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle-seat, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,\\r\\nhowever, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how\\r\\nyou have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who\\r\\ncould give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now\\r\\nwhen you emerged from your wraps. I could really have thought such a\\r\\nchange impossible....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout moving her head or looking at him, she said: \"I cannot say the\\r\\nsame with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got red and confused, and then, with a smile of resignation, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" was her reply. \"I am only stating facts. I don\\'t suppose you\\r\\nintend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter of perfect\\r\\nindifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a painful\\r\\nsubject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been doing\\r\\nsince I last saw you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt rather out of countenance, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I? I have traveled, shot, and grown old, as you see. And you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said, quite calmly: \"I have taken care of appearances, as you\\r\\nordered me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very near saying something brutal, but he checked himself, and\\r\\nkissed his wife\\'s hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I thank you,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised. He was indeed cool and always master of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now talk\\r\\nwithout any bitterness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made a little movement of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bitterness? I don\\'t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I am\\r\\nonly trying to keep up a difficult conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still looking at her, carried away in spite of her harshness, and\\r\\nhe felt seized with a brutal desire, the desire of the master.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerceiving that she had hurt his feelings, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old are you now? I thought you were younger than you look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grew rather pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am forty-five;\" and then he added: \"I forgot to ask after Princess de\\r\\nRaynes. Are you still intimate with her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him as if she hated him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I certainly am. She is very well, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey remained sitting side-by-side, agitated and irritated. Suddenly he\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I expect\\r\\nyou to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both morally and\\r\\nphysically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your husband,\\r\\nand it is my right to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but\\r\\nhis face was resolute and impenetrable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" she said, \"but I have made other engagements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse for you,\" was his reply. \"The law gives me the power,\\r\\nand I mean to use it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were getting to Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened\\r\\nspeed. The Baroness got up, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then\\r\\nturning to her husband, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of the _tête-à-tête_ which I had\\r\\ncarefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your\\r\\nadvice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other\\r\\npeople, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall go wherever you go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me in\\r\\npeace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the\\r\\nPrincess de Raynes and Countess Hermit waiting for me with their\\r\\nhusbands. I wished them to see us, and to know that we had spent the\\r\\nnight together in the railway-carriage. Don\\'t be alarmed; they will tell\\r\\nit everywhere as a most surprising fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice and\\r\\nsaved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in\\r\\norder to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to\\r\\navoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid--I am\\r\\nafraid--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up\\r\\nto open the carriage-door, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that I am in the family-way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess stretched out her arms to embrace her, and the Baroness\\r\\nsaid, pointing to the Baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was\\r\\ntrying to get at the truth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal, and\\r\\nhe agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take\\r\\nlittle trips like this, occasionally, like good friends who cannot live\\r\\ntogether. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped\\r\\nout on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron hastily shut the carriage-door, for he was too much disturbed\\r\\nto say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife\\'s voice,\\r\\nand their merry laughter as they went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told\\r\\nhim a lie or was speaking the truth.',\n"," 'THE LITTLE CASK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJules Chicot, the innkeeper, who lived at Épreville, pulled up his\\r\\ntilbury in front of Mother Magloire\\'s farmhouse. He was a tall man of\\r\\nabout forty, with a red face and a round stomach, and was generally said\\r\\nto be _a very knowing customer_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hitched his horse up to the gatepost and went in. He owned some land\\r\\nadjoining that of the old woman\\'s, which he had been coveting for a long\\r\\nwhile, and had tried in vain to buy a score of times, but she had always\\r\\nobstinately refused to part with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was born here, and here I mean to die,\" was all she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door. She was a\\r\\nwoman of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost\\r\\ndried up in fact, and much bent, but as active and untiring as a girl.\\r\\nChicot patted her on the back in a very friendly fashion, and then sat\\r\\ndown by her on a stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Mother, you are always pretty well and hearty, I am glad to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to complain of, considering, thank you. And how are you, Mons.\\r\\nChicot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains occasionally;\\r\\notherwise, I should have nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all the better!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work.\\r\\nHer crooked, knotty fingers, hard as a lobster\\'s claws, seized the\\r\\ntubers, which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of\\r\\npincers, and she peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin\\r\\nwith an old knife which she held in the other hand, throwing the\\r\\npotatoes into the water as they were done. Three daring fowls jumped one\\r\\nafter the other into her lap, seized a bit of peel, and then ran away as\\r\\nfast as their legs would carry them with it in their beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his\\r\\ntongue which he could not get out. At last he said hurriedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Mother Magloire--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your farm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not; you may make up your mind to that. What I have said, I\\r\\nhave said, so don\\'t refer to it again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well; only I fancy I have thought of an arrangement that might\\r\\nsuit us both very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are. You shall sell it to me, and keep it all the same. You\\r\\ndon\\'t understand? Very well, so just follow me in what I am going to\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman left off peeling her potatoes, and looked at the innkeeper\\r\\nattentively from under her bushy eyebrows, and he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me explain myself. Every month I will give you one hundred and\\r\\nfifty francs. You understand me, I suppose? Every month I will come and\\r\\nbring you thirty crowns[13] and it will not make the slightest\\r\\ndifference in your life--not the very slightest. You will have your own\\r\\nhome just as you have now, will not trouble yourself about me, and will\\r\\nowe me nothing; all you will have to do will be to take my money. Will\\r\\nthat arrangement suit you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said\\r\\nbenevolently, and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if\\r\\nshe suspected a trap, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems all right, as far as I am concerned, but it will not give you\\r\\nthe farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind about that,\" he said, \"you will remain here as long as it\\r\\npleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home. Only you\\r\\nwill sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me after your death.\\r\\nYou have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don\\'t care a\\r\\nstraw. Will that suit you? You will keep everything during your life,\\r\\nand I will give you the thirty crowns a month. It is pure gain as far as\\r\\nyou are concerned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but nevertheless, very much\\r\\ntempted to agree, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.\\r\\nCome back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then\\r\\ngive you my definite answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Chicot went off, as happy as a king who has conquered an empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in\\r\\nfact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation. She _smelt_, so to\\r\\nsay, that there was something underneath the offer which was not to her\\r\\nadvantage; but then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those\\r\\ncoins chinking in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies,\\r\\nwithout her doing anything for it, filled her with covetousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the notary, and told him about it. He advised her to accept\\r\\nChicot\\'s offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty\\r\\ninstead of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the\\r\\nlowest calculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you live for fifteen years longer,\" he said, \"even then he will only\\r\\nhave paid forty-five thousand francs for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns\\r\\na month; but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she\\r\\nremained a long time with the lawyer, asking questions without being\\r\\nable to make up her mind to go. At last she gave him instructions to\\r\\ndraw up the deed, and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if\\r\\nshe had drunk four jugs of new cider.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Chicot came again to receive her answer she took a lot of\\r\\npersuading, and declared that she could not make up her mind to agree to\\r\\nhis proposal, though she was all the time on tenter-hooks lest he should\\r\\nnot consent to give the fifty crowns: but at last, when he grew urgent,\\r\\nshe told him what she expected for her farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised and disappointed, and refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in order to convince him, she began to talk about the probable\\r\\nduration of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly not likely to live for more than five or six years\\r\\nlonger. I am nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering\\r\\nmy age. The other evening I thought I was going to die, and could\\r\\nhardly manage to crawl into bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Chicot was not going to be taken in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and will\\r\\nlive till you are a hundred at least; you will be sure to see me put\\r\\nunderground first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman\\r\\nwould not give way, the landlord consented to give the fifty crowns, and\\r\\nshe insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years passed by, and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day\\r\\nolder. Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been\\r\\npaying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done,\\r\\nthat he was ruined. From time to time he went to see his annuitant, just\\r\\nas one goes in July to see when the harvest is likely to begin. She\\r\\nalways met him with a cunning look, and one would have felt inclined to\\r\\nthink that she was congratulating herself on the trick she had played\\r\\nhim. Seeing how well and hearty she seemed, he very soon got into his\\r\\ntilbury again, growling to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you never die, you old brute?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he\\r\\nsaw her. He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a\\r\\npeasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for means of\\r\\ngetting rid of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands like he did the\\r\\nfirst time when he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a\\r\\nfew minutes, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you are\\r\\nin Épreville? The people are talking about it, and saying that we are\\r\\nnot on friendly terms, and that pains me. You know it will cost you\\r\\nnothing if you come, for I don\\'t look at the price of a dinner. Come\\r\\nwhenever you feel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Mother Magloire did not need to be told twice, and the next day but\\r\\none, as she was going to town in any case, it being market-day, in her\\r\\ngig, driven by her man, she, without any demur, put her trap up in\\r\\nChicot\\'s stable, and went in search of her promised dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe publican was delighted, and treated her like a lady, giving her\\r\\nroast fowl, blackpudding, leg of mutton, and bacon and cabbage. But she\\r\\nate next to nothing. She had always been a small eater, and had\\r\\ngenerally lived on a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot was disappointed, and pressed her to eat more, but she refused,\\r\\nand she would drink next to nothing either, and declined any coffee, so\\r\\nhe asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as to that, I don\\'t know that I will refuse.\" Whereupon he\\r\\nshouted out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosalie, bring the superfine brandy,--_the special_,--you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper\\r\\nvine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just try that; you will find it first-rate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last\\r\\nall the longer, and when she had finished her glass, draining the last\\r\\ndrops so as to make the pleasure last all the longer, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that is first-rate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost before she had said it, Chicot had poured her out another\\r\\nglassful. She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it\\r\\nvery slowly, like she had done the first, and he asked her to have a\\r\\nthird. She objected, but he persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen without any\\r\\nill effects; it goes down like sugar, and leaves no signs in the head,\\r\\none would think that it evaporated on the tongue. It is the most\\r\\nwholesome thing you can drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, for she really wished to have it, but she left half the\\r\\nglass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chicot, in an excess of generosity, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small keg\\r\\nof it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends.\" So she\\r\\ntook one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of what\\r\\nshe had drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the innkeeper drove into her yard, and took a little\\r\\niron-hooped keg out of his gig. He insisted on her tasting the contents,\\r\\nto make sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each\\r\\nof them drunk three more glasses, he said, as he was going away:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know, when it is all gone, there is more left; don\\'t be\\r\\nmodest, for I shall not mind. The sooner it is finished, the better\\r\\npleased I shall be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days later he came again. The old woman was outside her door\\r\\ncutting up the bread for her soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went up to her, and put his face close to hers, so that he might\\r\\nsmell her breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you will give me a glass of _the special_?\" he said. And they\\r\\nhad three glasses each.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was\\r\\nin the habit of getting drunk all by herself. She was picked up in her\\r\\nkitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and\\r\\nshe was often brought home like a log.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to him about\\r\\nher, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age; but\\r\\nwhen people get old there is no remedy. It will be the death of her in\\r\\nthe long run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it certainly was the death of her. She died the next winter. About\\r\\nChristmas-time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found\\r\\ndead the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Chicot came in for the farm he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very stupid of her; if she had not taken to drink she might very\\r\\nwell have lived for ten years longer.\"',\n"," 'HOW HE GOT THE LEGION OF HONOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people are born with a predominant instinct, with some vocation or\\r\\nsome desire which has been evoked as soon as they begin to speak or to\\r\\nthink.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since he was a child M. Caillard had only had one idea in his\\r\\nhead--to be decorated. When he was still quite a small boy he used to\\r\\nwear a zinc Cross of the Legion of Honor in his tunic, just like other\\r\\nchildren wear a soldier\\'s cap, and he took his mother\\'s hand in the\\r\\nstreet with a proud look, sticking out his little chest with its red\\r\\nribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis studies were not a success, and he failed in his Examination for\\r\\nBachelor of Arts; so, not knowing what to do, he married a pretty girl,\\r\\nas he had plenty of money of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived in Paris, like many rich middle-class people do, mixing with\\r\\ntheir own particular set, without going among other people, and proud of\\r\\nknowing a Deputy, who might perhaps be a Minister some day, while two\\r\\nChiefs of Division were among their friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mons. Caillard could not get rid of his one absorbing idea, and he\\r\\nfelt constantly unhappy because he had not the right to wear a little\\r\\nbit of colored ribbon in his buttonhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he met any men who were decorated, on the boulevards, he looked at\\r\\nthem askance, with intense jealousy. Sometimes, when he had nothing to\\r\\ndo in the afternoon, he would count them, and say to himself: \"Just let\\r\\nme see how many I shall meet between the Madeleine and the Rue Druot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye\\r\\nfor the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his\\r\\nwalk he always said the numbers out aloud. \"Eight officers and seventeen\\r\\nknights. As many as that! It is stupid to sow the Cross broadcast in\\r\\nthat fashion. I wonder how many I shall meet going back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he returned slowly, unhappy when the crowd of passers-by interfered\\r\\nwith his seeing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew the places where most were to be found. They swarmed in the\\r\\nPalais Royal. Fewer were seen in the Avenue de l\\'Opera than in the Rue\\r\\nde la Paix, while the right side of the boulevard was more frequented by\\r\\nthem than the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also seemed to prefer certain cafés and theaters. Whenever he saw a\\r\\ngroup of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of\\r\\nthe pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:\\r\\n\"They are officers of the Legion of Honor,\" and he felt inclined to take\\r\\noff his hat to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had often remarked that the officers had a different bearing to the\\r\\nmere knights. They carried their head differently, and one felt that\\r\\nthey enjoyed a higher official consideration, and a more widely-extended\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes again the worthy man would be seized with a furious hatred for\\r\\neveryone who was decorated; he felt like a Socialist towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when he got home, excited at meeting so many Crosses--just like a\\r\\npoor hungry wretch is on passing some dainty provision shop--he used to\\r\\nask in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When shall we get rid of this wretched Government?\" And his wife would\\r\\nbe surprised, and ask:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am indignant,\" he replied, \"at the injustice I see going on around\\r\\nus. Oh! the Communards were certainly right!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner he would go out again and look at the shops where all the\\r\\ndecorations were sold, and he examined all the emblems of various shapes\\r\\nand colors. He would have liked to possess them all, and to have walked\\r\\ngravely at the head of a procession with his crush-hat under his arm and\\r\\nhis breast covered with decorations, radiant as a star, amid a buzz of\\r\\nadmiring whispers and a hum of respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! he had no right to wear any decoration whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used to say to himself: \"It is really too difficult for any man to\\r\\nobtain the Legion of Honor unless he is some public functionary. Suppose\\r\\nI try to get appointed an officer of the Academy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did not know how to set about it, and spoke to his wife on the\\r\\nsubject, who was stupefied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Officer of the Academy! What have you done to deserve it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got angry. \"I know what I am talking about; I only want to know how\\r\\nto set about it. You are quite stupid at times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled. \"You are quite right; I don\\'t understand anything about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn idea struck him: \"Suppose you were to speak to M. Rosselin, the\\r\\nDeputy, he might be able to advise me. You understand I cannot broach\\r\\nthe subject to him directly. It is rather difficult and delicate, but\\r\\ncoming from you it might seem quite natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Caillard did what he asked her, and M. Rosselin promised to speak\\r\\nto the Minister about it, and then Caillard began to worry him, till the\\r\\nDeputy told him he must make a formal application and put forward his\\r\\nclaims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What were his claims?\" he said. \"He was not even a Bachelor of Arts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he set to work and produced a pamphlet, with the title, \"The\\r\\nPeople\\'s Right to Instruction,\" but he could not finish it for want of\\r\\nideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The\\r\\nfirst was, \"The Instruction of Children by means of the Eye.\" He wanted\\r\\ngratuitous theaters to be established in every poor quarter of Paris for\\r\\nlittle children. Their parents were to take them there when they were\\r\\nquite young, and, by means of a magic-lantern, all the notions of human\\r\\nknowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular courses.\\r\\nThe sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain\\r\\nimpressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made\\r\\nvisible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history,\\r\\nnatural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, &c., &c., thus?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his ideas printed in tract form, and sent a copy to each Deputy,\\r\\nten to each Minister, fifty to the President of the Republic, ten to\\r\\neach Parisian and five to each provincial newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he wrote on \"Street Lending-Libraries.\" His idea was to have\\r\\nlittle carts full of books drawn about the streets, like orange-carts\\r\\nare. Every householder or lodger would have a right to ten volumes a\\r\\nmonth by means of a halfpenny subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The people,\" M. Caillard said, \"will only disturb itself for the sake\\r\\nof its pleasures, and since it will not go to instruction, instruction\\r\\nmust come to it,\" &c., &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis essays attracted no attention, but he sent in his application, and\\r\\nhe got the usual formal official reply. He thought himself sure of\\r\\nsuccess, but nothing came of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made up his mind to apply personally. He begged for an interview\\r\\nwith the Minister of Public Instruction, and he was received by a young\\r\\nsubordinate, who already was very grave and important, and who kept\\r\\ntouching the knobs of electric-bells to summon ushers, and footmen, and\\r\\nofficials inferior to himself. He declared to M. Caillard that his\\r\\nmatter was going on quite favorably, and advised him to continue his\\r\\nremarkable labors, and M. Caillard set at it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Rosselin, the Deputy, seemed now to take a great interest in his\\r\\nsuccess, and gave him a lot of excellent, practical advice. He was\\r\\ndecorated, although nobody knew exactly what he had done to deserve such\\r\\na distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told Caillard what new studies he ought to undertake; he introduced\\r\\nhim to learned Societies which took up particularly obscure points of\\r\\nscience, in the hope of gaining credit and honors thereby; and he even\\r\\ntook him under his wing at the Ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when he came to lunch with his friend (for several months past\\r\\nhe had constantly taken his meals there), he said to him in a whisper as\\r\\nhe shook hands: \"I have just obtained a great favor for you. The\\r\\nCommittee of Historical Works is going to intrust you with a commission.\\r\\nThere are some researches to be made in various libraries in France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaillard was so delighted that he could scarcely eat or drink, and a\\r\\nweek later he set out. He went from town to town, studying catalogues,\\r\\nrummaging in lofts full of dusty volumes, and was hated by all the\\r\\nlibrarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, happening to be at Rouen, he thought he should like to go and\\r\\nembrace his wife, whom he had not seen for more than a week, so he took\\r\\nthe nine o\\'clock train, which would land him at home by twelve at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his latchkey, so he went in without making any noise, delighted\\r\\nat the idea of the surprise he was going to give her. She had locked\\r\\nherself in. How tiresome! However, he cried out through the door:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jeanne, it is I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must have been very frightened, for he heard her jump out of bed and\\r\\nspeak to herself, as if she were in a dream. Then she went to her\\r\\ndressing-room, opened and closed the door, and went quickly up and down\\r\\nher room barefoot two or three times, shaking the furniture till the\\r\\nvases and glasses sounded. Then at last she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it you, Alexander?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he replied; \"make haste and open the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had done so, she threw herself into his arms, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! what a fright!... What a surprise!... What a pleasure!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to undress himself methodically, like he did everything, and\\r\\nfrom a chair he took his overcoat, which he was in the habit of hanging\\r\\nup in the hall. But, suddenly, he remained motionless, struck dumb with\\r\\nastonishment--there was a red ribbon in the buttonhole!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" he stammered, \"this--this--this--this overcoat has got the\\r\\nrosette in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a second his wife threw herself on him, and taking it from his hands,\\r\\nshe said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! you have made a mistake--give it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he still held it by one of the sleeves, without letting it go,\\r\\nrepeating, in a half-dazed manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Why? Just explain ... whose overcoat is it? It is not mine, as it\\r\\nhas the Legion of Honor on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to take it from him, terrified, and hardly able to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen ... listen ... give it me ... I must not tell you ... it is a\\r\\nsecret ... listen to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he grew angry, and turned pale:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know how this overcoat comes to be here? It does not belong\\r\\nto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she almost screamed at him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes it does; listen ... swear to me ... well ... you are decorated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not intend to joke at his expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so overcome that he let the overcoat fall, and dropped into an\\r\\narmchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am ... you say I am ... decorated?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but it is a secret, a great secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had put the glorious garment into a cupboard, and came to her\\r\\nhusband pale and trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she continued, \"it is a new overcoat that I have had made for\\r\\nyou. But I swore that I would not tell you anything about it, as it will\\r\\nnot be officially announced for a month or six weeks, and you were not\\r\\nto have known till your return from your business journey. M. Rosselin\\r\\nmanaged it for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin!\" he contrived to utter in his joy; \"he has obtained the\\r\\ndecoration for me? He--Oh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he was obliged to drink a glass of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the\\r\\novercoat. Caillard picked it up; it was a visiting-card, and he read\\r\\nout:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin--Deputy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see how it is,\" said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe almost cried with joy, and, a week later, it was announced in the\\r\\n_Journal Officiel_ that M. Caillard had been awarded the Legion of Honor\\r\\non account of his exceptional services.',\n"," 'THE ACCURSED BREAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDaddy Taille had three daughters: Anna, the eldest, who was scarcely\\r\\never mentioned in the family; Rose, the second girl, who was eighteen;\\r\\nand Clara, the youngest, who was a girl of fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Taille was a widower, and a foreman in M. Lebrument\\'s\\r\\nbutton-manufactory. He was a very upright man, very well thought of,\\r\\nabstemious; in fact a sort of model workman. He lived at Havre, in the\\r\\nRue d\\'Angoulême.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Anna ran away the old man flew into a fearful rage. He threatened\\r\\nto kill the seducer, who was head clerk in a large draper\\'s\\r\\nestablishment in that town. Then, when he was told by various people\\r\\nthat she was keeping very steady and investing money in Government\\r\\nsecurities, that she was no gadabout, but was kept by a Mons. Dubois,\\r\\nwho was a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, the father was appeased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe even showed some anxiety as to how she was getting on, asked some of\\r\\nher old friends who had been to see her how she was getting on; and when\\r\\ntold that she had her own furniture, and that her mantelpiece was\\r\\ncovered with vases and the walls with pictures, that there were clocks\\r\\nand carpets everywhere, he gave a broad, contented smile. He had been\\r\\nworking for thirty years to get together a wretched five or six thousand\\r\\nfrancs. This girl was evidently no fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning the son of Touchard, the cooper, at the other end of\\r\\nthe street, came and asked him for the hand of Rose, the second girl.\\r\\nThe old man\\'s heart began to beat, for the Touchards were rich and in a\\r\\ngood position. He was decidedly lucky with his girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage was agreed upon, and it was settled that it should be a\\r\\ngrand affair, and the wedding dinner was to be held at Sainte-Adresse,\\r\\nat Mother Lusa\\'s restaurant. It would cost a lot certainly; but never\\r\\nmind, it did not matter just for once in a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one morning, just as the old man was going home to breakfast with\\r\\nhis two daughters the door opened suddenly, and Anna appeared. She was\\r\\nelegantly dressed, wore rings and an expensive bonnet, and looked\\r\\nundeniably pretty and nice. She threw her arms round her father\\'s neck\\r\\nbefore he could say a word, then fell into her sister\\'s arms with many\\r\\ntears, and then asked for a plate, so that she might share the family\\r\\nsoup. Taille was moved to tears in his turn and said several times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right, dear; that is right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told them about herself. She did not wish Rose\\'s wedding to\\r\\ntake place at Sainte-Adresse,--certainly not. It should take place at\\r\\nher house, and would cost her father nothing. She had settled everything\\r\\nand arranged everything, so it was \"no good to say any more about\\r\\nit,--there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear! very well!\" the old man said, \"we will leave it\\r\\nso.\" But then he felt some doubt. Would the Touchards consent? But Rose,\\r\\nthe bride-elect, was surprised and asked, \"Why should they object, I\\r\\nshould like to know? Just leave that to me, I will talk to Philip about\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mentioned it to her lover the very same day, and he declared that\\r\\nit would suit him exactly. Father and Mother Touchard were naturally\\r\\ndelighted at the idea of a good dinner which would cost them nothing,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be quite sure that everything will be in first-rate style, as\\r\\nM. Dubois is made of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey asked to be allowed to bring a friend, Mme. Florence, the cook on\\r\\nthe first floor, and Anna agreed to everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was fixed for the last Tuesday of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the civil formalities and the religious ceremony the wedding party\\r\\nwent to Anna\\'s house. Among those whom the Tailles had brought was a\\r\\ncousin of a certain age, a M. Sauvetanin, a man given to philosophical\\r\\nreflections, serious, and always very self-possessed, and Mme.\\r\\nLamonoois, an old aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Sauvetanin had been told off to give Anna his arm, as they were\\r\\nlooked upon as the two most important persons in the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they had arrived at the door of Anna\\'s house she let go her\\r\\ncompanion\\'s arm, and ran on ahead, saying, \"I will show you the way,\"\\r\\nand ran upstairs while the invited guests followed more slowly; and,\\r\\nwhen they got upstairs, she stood on one side to let them pass, and they\\r\\nrolled their eyes and turned their heads in all directions to admire\\r\\nthis mysterious and luxurious dwelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was laid in the drawing-room as the dining-room had been\\r\\nthought too small. Extra knives, forks, and spoons had been hired from\\r\\na neighboring restaurant, and decanters full of wine under the rays of\\r\\nthe sun which shown in through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies went into the bedroom to take off their shawls and bonnets,\\r\\nand Father Touchard, who was standing at the door, squinted at the low\\r\\nwide bed, and made funny and suggestive signs to the men, with many a\\r\\nwink and a nod. Daddy Taille, who thought a great deal of himself,\\r\\nlooked with fatherly pride at his child\\'s well-furnished rooms, and went\\r\\nfrom one to the other holding his hat in his hand, making a mental\\r\\ninventory of everything, and walking like a verger in a church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna went backwards and forwards, ran about giving orders and hurrying\\r\\non the wedding feast. Soon she appeared at the door of the dining-room,\\r\\nand cried: \"Come here, all of you, for a moment,\" and when the twelve\\r\\nguests did as they were asked they saw twelve glasses of Madeira on a\\r\\nsmall table.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose and her husband had their arms round each other\\'s waists, and were\\r\\nkissing each other in every corner. Mons. Sauvetanin never took his eyes\\r\\noff Anna; he no doubt felt that ardor, that sort of expectation which\\r\\nall men, even if they are old and ugly, feel for women of a certain\\r\\nstamp, as if they owed a little of themselves, professionally, to all\\r\\nmales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down, and the wedding-breakfast began; the relations sitting at\\r\\none end of the table and the young people at the other. Mme. Touchard,\\r\\nthe mother, presided on the right and the bride on the left. Anna looked\\r\\nafter everybody, saw that the glasses were kept filled and the plates\\r\\nwell supplied. The guests evidently felt a certain respectful\\r\\nembarrassment at the sight of all the sumptuousness of the rooms and at\\r\\nthe lavish manner in which they were treated. They all ate heartily of\\r\\nthe good things provided, but there were no jokes such as are prevalent\\r\\nat weddings of that sort; it was all too grand, and it made them feel\\r\\nuncomfortable. Old Madame Touchard, who was fond of a bit of fun, tried\\r\\nto enliven matters a little, and at the beginning of the dessert she\\r\\nexclaimed: \"I say, Philip, do sing us something.\" The neighbors in their\\r\\nstreet considered that he had the finest voice in all Havre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom got up, smiled, and turning to his sister-in-law, from\\r\\npoliteness and gallantry, tried to think of something suitable for the\\r\\noccasion, something serious and correct, to harmonize with the\\r\\nseriousness of the repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna had a satisfied look on her face, and leaned back in her chair to\\r\\nlisten, and all assumed looks of attention, though prepared to smile\\r\\nshould smiles be called for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singer announced, \"The Accursed Bread,\" and extending his right arm,\\r\\nwhich made his coat ruck up into his neck, he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was decidedly long, three verses of eight lines each, with the last\\r\\nline and the last line but one repeated twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went well for the first two verses; they were the usual commonplaces\\r\\nabout bread gained by honest labor and by dishonesty. The aunt and the\\r\\nbride wept outright. The cook, who was present, at the end of the first\\r\\nverse looked at a roll which she held in her hand with running eyes, as\\r\\nif they applied to her, while all applauded vigorously. At the end of\\r\\nthe second verse the two servants, who were standing with their backs\\r\\nto the wall, joined loudly in the chorus, and the aunt and the bride\\r\\nwept outright. Daddy Taille blew his nose with the noise of a trombone,\\r\\nand old Touchard brandished a whole loaf half over the table, and the\\r\\ncook shed silent tears on the crust which she was still holding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmidst the general emotion M. Sauvetanin said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the right sort of song; very different to the nasty, risky\\r\\nthings one generally hears at weddings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna, who was visibly affected, kissed her hand to her sister, and\\r\\npointed to her husband with an affectionate nod, as if to congratulate\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntoxicated by his success, the young man continued, and unfortunately\\r\\nthe last verse contained the words about the bread of dishonor gained by\\r\\nyoung girls who had been led astray from the paths of virtue. No one\\r\\ntook up the refrain about this bread, supposed to be eaten with tears,\\r\\nexcept old Touchard and the two servants. Anna had grown deadly pale,\\r\\nand cast down her eyes, while the bridegroom looked from one to the\\r\\nother without understanding the reason for this sudden coldness, and the\\r\\ncook hastily dropped the crust as if it were poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMons. Sauvetanin said solemnly, in order to save the situation: \"That\\r\\nlast couplet is not at all necessary;\" and Daddy Taille, who had got red\\r\\nup to the ears, looked round the table fiercely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Anna, with her eyes swimming in tears, told the servants, in the\\r\\nfaltering voice of a woman trying to stifle her sobs, to bring the\\r\\nchampagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the guests were suddenly seized with exuberant joy, and all their\\r\\nfaces became radiant again. And when old Touchard, who had seen, felt,\\r\\nand understood nothing of what was going on, and, pointing to the guests\\r\\nso as to emphasize his words, sang the last words of the refrain:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread,\" the whole company,\\r\\nwhen they saw the champagne bottles, with their necks covered with gold\\r\\nfoil appear, burst out singing, as if electrified by the sight:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread.\"',\n"," 'WHAT WAS REALLY THE MATTER WITH ANDREW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer\\'s house looked on to the Square. Behind it, there was a nice,\\r\\nwell-kept garden, with a back entrance into a narrow street which was\\r\\nalmost always deserted, and from which it was separated by a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of that garden Maitre[14] Moreau\\'s wife had promised, for\\r\\nthe first time, to meet Captain Sommerive, who had been making love to\\r\\nher for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband had gone to Paris for a week, so she was quite free for the\\r\\ntime being. The Captain had begged so hard, and had used such loving\\r\\nwords, she was certain that he loved her so ardently, and she felt so\\r\\nisolated, so misunderstood, so neglected amidst all the law business\\r\\nwhich seemed to be her husband\\'s sole pleasure, that she had given away\\r\\nher heart without even asking herself whether it would give her anything\\r\\nelse at some future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, after some months of platonic love, of pressing of hands, of\\r\\nkisses rapidly stolen behind a door, the Captain had declared that he\\r\\nwould ask permission to exchange, and leave the town immediately, if she\\r\\nwould not grant him a meeting, a real meeting, during her husband\\'s\\r\\nabsence; and so at length she yielded to his importunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she was waiting, close against the wall, with a beating heart,\\r\\ntrembling at the slightest sound, and when at length she heard somebody\\r\\nclimbing up the wall, she very nearly ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose it were not he, but a thief? But no; someone called out softly,\\r\\n\"_Matilda_!\" and when she replied, \"_Etienne_!\" a man jumped on to the\\r\\npath with a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was he,--and what a kiss!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time they remained in each other\\'s arms, with united lips.\\r\\nBut suddenly a fine rain began to fall, and the drops from the leaves\\r\\nfell on to her neck and made her start. Whereupon he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Matilda, my adored one, my darling, my angel, let us go indoors. It is\\r\\ntwelve o\\'clock, we can have nothing to fear; please let us go to your\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dearest; I am too frightened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he held her in his arms, and whispered in her ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your servants sleep on the third floor, looking on to the Square, and\\r\\nyour room, on the first, looks on to the garden, so nobody can hear us.\\r\\nI love you so that I wish to love you entirely, from head to foot.\" And\\r\\nhe embraced her vehemently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe resisted still, frightened and even ashamed. But he put his arms\\r\\nround her, lifted her up, and carried her off under the rain, which was\\r\\nby this time descending in torrents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was open; they groped their way upstairs; and when they were in\\r\\nthe room he bolted the door while she lit a match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she fell, half fainting, into a chair, while he knelt down beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, she said, panting:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Etienne, please let me remain a virtuous woman; I should be\\r\\ntoo angry with you afterwards; and after all, it is so horrid, so\\r\\ncommon. Cannot we love each other with a spiritual love only?... Oh!\\r\\nEtienne!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was inexorable, and then she tried to get up and escape from his\\r\\nattacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her fright she ran to the bed in order to hide herself behind the\\r\\ncurtains; but it was a dangerous place of refuge, and he followed her.\\r\\nBut in haste he took off his sword too quickly, and it fell on the floor\\r\\nwith a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then--a prolonged, shrill child\\'s cry came from the next room, the\\r\\ndoor of which had remained open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have awakened the child,\" she whispered, \"and perhaps he will not\\r\\ngo to sleep again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was only fifteen months old, and slept in a room opening out of hers,\\r\\nso that she might be able to hear him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain exclaimed, ardently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does it matter, Matilda? How I love you; you must come to me,\\r\\nMatilda.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she struggled, and resisted in her fright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Just listen how he is crying; he will wake up the nurse, and\\r\\nwhat should we do if she were to come? We should be lost. Just listen to\\r\\nme, Etienne. When he screams at night his father always takes him into\\r\\nour bed, and he is quiet immediately; it is the only means of keeping\\r\\nhim still. Do let me take him....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child roared, uttered shrill screams, which pierced the thickest\\r\\nwalls, so as to be heard by passers-by in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his consternation, the Captain got up, and Matilda jumped out and\\r\\ntook the child into her bed, when he was quiet at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtienne sat astride on a chair, and made a cigarette, and in about five\\r\\nminutes Andrew went to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take him back,\" his mother said; and she took him back very\\r\\ncarefully to his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned, the Captain was waiting for her with open arms, and\\r\\nput his arms round her in a transport of love, while she, embracing him\\r\\nmore closely, said, stammering:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Etienne, my darling, if you only knew how I love you; how....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew began to cry again, and he, in a rage, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confound it all, won\\'t the little brute be quiet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, the little brute would not be quiet, but howled all the louder, on\\r\\nthe contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought she heard a noise downstairs; no doubt the nurse was coming,\\r\\nso she jumped up, and took the child into bed, and he grew quiet\\r\\ndirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree times she put him back, and three times she had to fetch him\\r\\nagain, and an hour before daybreak the Captain had to go, swearing like\\r\\nthe proverbial trooper; and, to calm his impatience, Matilda promised to\\r\\nreceive him again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course he came, more impatient and ardent than ever, excited by the\\r\\ndelay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took care to put his sword carefully into a corner; he took off his\\r\\nboots like a thief, and spoke so low that Matilda could hardly hear him.\\r\\nAt last, he was just going to be really happy when the floor, or some\\r\\npiece of furniture, or perhaps the bed itself, creaked; it sounded as\\r\\nif something had broken; and in a moment a cry, feeble at first, but\\r\\nwhich grew louder every moment, made itself heard. Andrew was awake\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe _yapped_ like a fox, and there was not the slightest doubt that if he\\r\\nwent on like that the whole house would awake; so his mother, not\\r\\nknowing what to do, got up and brought him. The Captain was more furious\\r\\nthan ever, but did not move, and very carefully he put out his hand,\\r\\ntook a small piece of the child\\'s skin between his two fingers, no\\r\\nmatter where it was, the thighs or elsewhere, and pinched it. The little\\r\\none struggled and screamed in a deafening manner, but his tormentor\\r\\npinched everywhere furiously and more vigorously. He took a morsel of\\r\\nflesh and twisted and turned it, and then let go in order to take hold\\r\\nof another piece, and then another and another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child screamed like a chicken that is having its throat cut, or a\\r\\ndog that is being mercilessly beaten. His mother caressed him, kissed\\r\\nhim, and tried to stifle his cries by her tenderness; but Andrew grew\\r\\npurple, as if he were going into convulsions, and kicked and struggled\\r\\nwith his little arms and legs in an alarming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain said, softly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try and take him back to his cradle; perhaps he will be quiet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Matilda went into the other room with the child in her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he was out of his mother\\'s bed he cried less loudly, and when\\r\\nhe was in his own he was quiet, with exception of a few broken sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the night was tranquil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night he came again. As he happened to speak rather loudly,\\r\\nAndrew awoke again and began to scream. His mother went and fetched him\\r\\nimmediately, but the Captain pinched so hard and long that the child was\\r\\nnearly suffocated by its cries, and its eyes turned in its head and it\\r\\nfoamed at the mouth; as soon as it was back in its cradle it was quiet,\\r\\nand in four days Andrew did not cry any more to come into his mother\\'s\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday evening the lawyer returned, and took his place again at the\\r\\ndomestic hearth and in the conjugal chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was tired with his journey he went to bed early; but he had not\\r\\nlong lain down when he said to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, how is it that Andrew is not crying? Just go and fetch him,\\r\\nMatilda; I like to feel that he is between us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up and brought the child, but as soon as he saw that he was in\\r\\nthat bed, in which he had been so fond of sleeping a few days\\r\\npreviously, he wriggled and screamed so violently in his fright that she\\r\\nhad to take him back to his cradle.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Moreau could not get over his surprise. \"What a very funny thing!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with him this evening? I suppose he is sleepy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been like that all the time that you were away; I have never\\r\\nbeen able to have him in bed with me once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the child woke up and began to laugh and play with his\\r\\ntoys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer, who was an affectionate man, got up, kissed his offspring,\\r\\nand took him into his arms to carry him to their bed. Andrew laughed,\\r\\nwith that vacant laugh of little creatures whose ideas are still vague.\\r\\nHe suddenly saw the bed and his mother in it, and his happy little face\\r\\npuckered up, till suddenly he began to scream furiously, and struggled\\r\\nas if he were going to be put to the torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment his father said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be something the matter with the child,\" and mechanically he\\r\\nlifted up his little nightshirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe uttered a prolonged \"O--o--h!\" of astonishment. The child\\'s calves,\\r\\nthighs, and buttocks were covered with blue spots as big as halfpennies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look, Matilda!\" the father exclaimed; \"this is horrible!\" And the\\r\\nmother rushed forward in a fright. It was horrible; no doubt the\\r\\nbeginning of some sort of leprosy, of one of those strange affections of\\r\\nthe skin which doctors are often at a loss to account for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parents looked at one another in consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must send for the doctor,\" the father said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Matilda, pale as death, was looking at her child, who was spotted\\r\\nlike a leopard. Then suddenly uttering a violent cry, as if she had seen\\r\\nsomething that filled her with horror, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! the wretch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment M. Moreau asked: \"What are you talking about? What\\r\\nwretch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red up to the roots of her hair, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing! but I think I can guess--it must be--we ought to send for\\r\\nthe doctor ... it must be that wretch of a nurse who has been pinching\\r\\nthe poor child to make him keep quiet when he cries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his rage the lawyer sent for the nurse, and very nearly beat her.\\r\\nShe denied it most impudently, but was instantly dismissed, and the\\r\\nMunicipality having been informed of her conduct, she will find it a\\r\\nhard matter to get another situation.',\n"," 'MY LANDLADY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time (George Kervelen said) I was living in furnished lodgings\\r\\nin the Rue des Saints-Pères.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my father had made up his mind that I should go to Paris to\\r\\ncontinue my law studies, there had been a long discussion about settling\\r\\neverything. My allowance had been fixed at first at two thousand five\\r\\nhundred francs, but my poor mother was so anxious, that she said to my\\r\\nfather that if I spent my money badly I might not take enough to eat,\\r\\nand then my health would suffer, and so it was settled that a\\r\\ncomfortable boarding-house should be found for me, and that the amount\\r\\nshould be paid to the proprietor himself, or herself, every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of our neighbors told us of a certain Mme. Kergaran, a native of\\r\\nBrittany, who took in boarders, and so my father arranged matters by\\r\\nletter with this respectable person, at whose house I and my luggage\\r\\narrived one evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was a woman of about forty. She was very stout, had a\\r\\nvoice like a drill-sergeant, and decided everything in a very abrupt\\r\\nmanner. Her house was narrow, with only one window opening on to the\\r\\nstreet on each story, which rather gave it the appearance of a ladder of\\r\\nwindows, or better, perhaps, of a slice of a house sandwiched in between\\r\\ntwo others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady lived on the first floor with her servant, the kitchen and\\r\\ndining-room were on the second, and four boarders from Brittany lived\\r\\non the third and fourth, and I had two rooms on the fifth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little dark corkscrew staircase led up to these attics. All day long\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was up and down these stairs like a captain on board ship.\\r\\nTen times a day she would go into each room, noisily superintending\\r\\neverything, seeing that the beds were properly made, the clothes well\\r\\nbrushed, if the attendance were all that it should be; in a word, she\\r\\nlooked after her boarders like a mother, and better than a mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon made the acquaintance of my four fellow-countrymen. Two were\\r\\nmedical and two were law students, but all impartially endured the\\r\\nlandlady\\'s despotic yoke. They were as frightened of her as a boy\\r\\nrobbing an orchard would be of a rural policeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, immediately felt that I wished to be independent; it is my\\r\\nnature to rebel. I declared at once that I meant to come in at whatever\\r\\ntime I liked, for Mme. Kergaran had fixed twelve o\\'clock at night as the\\r\\nlimit. On hearing this she looked at me for a few moments, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is quite impossible; I cannot have Annette awakened at any hour of\\r\\nthe night. You can have nothing to do out-of-doors at such a time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied firmly that, according to the law, she was obliged to open the\\r\\ndoor for me at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you refuse,\" I said, \"I shall get a policeman to witness the fact,\\r\\nand go and get a bed at some hotel, at your expense, in which I shall be\\r\\nfully justified. You will, therefore, be obliged either to open the door\\r\\nfor me or to get rid of me. Do which you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed in her face as I told her my conditions. She could not speak\\r\\nfor a moment for surprise, then she tried to negotiate, but I was firm,\\r\\nand she was obliged to yield; and so it was agreed that I should have a\\r\\nlatchkey, on my solemn undertaking that no one else should know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy energy made such a wholesome impression on her that from that time\\r\\nshe treated me with marked favor; she was most attentive, and even\\r\\nshowed me a sort of rough tenderness which was not at all unpleasing.\\r\\nSometimes when I was in a jovial mood I would kiss her by surprise, if\\r\\nonly for the sake of getting the box on the ears which she gave me\\r\\nimmediately afterwards. When I managed to duck my head quickly enough,\\r\\nher hand would pass over me as swiftly as a ball, and I would run away\\r\\nlaughing, while she would call after me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you wretch, I will pay you out for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we soon became real friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I made the acquaintance of a girl who was\\r\\nemployed in a shop, and whom I constantly met. You know what such sort\\r\\nof love affairs are in Paris. One fine day, going to a lecture, you meet\\r\\na work-girl going to work arm-in-arm with a friend. You look at her and\\r\\nfeel that pleasant little shock which the eye of some women gives you.\\r\\nThe next day at the same time, going through the same street, you meet\\r\\nher again, and the next, and the succeeding days. At last you speak, and\\r\\nthe love affair follows its course just like an illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, by the end of three weeks I was on that footing with Emma which\\r\\nprecedes a fall. The fall would indeed have taken place much sooner had\\r\\nI known where to bring it about. The girl lived at home, and utterly\\r\\nrefused to go to an hotel. I did not know how to manage, but at last I\\r\\ntook the desperate resolve to take her to my room some night at about\\r\\neleven o\\'clock, under the pretense of giving her a cup of tea. Mme.\\r\\nKergaran always went to bed at ten, so that we could get in by means of\\r\\nmy latchkey without exciting any attention, and go down again in an hour\\r\\nor two in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good deal of entreaty on my part, Emma accepted my invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not spend a very pleasant day, for I was by no means easy in my\\r\\nmind. I was afraid of complications, of a catastrophe, of some scandal.\\r\\nAt night I went into a café, and drank two cups of coffee, and three or\\r\\nfour glasses of cognac, to give me courage, and when I heard the clock\\r\\nstrike half-past ten, I went slowly to the place of meeting, where she\\r\\nwas already waiting for me. She took my arm in a coaxing manner, and we\\r\\nset off slowly towards my lodgings. The nearer we got to the door the\\r\\nmore nervous I got, and I thought to myself--\"If only Mme. Kergaran is\\r\\nin bed already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to Emma two or three times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Above all things, don\\'t make any noise on the stairs,\" to which she\\r\\nreplied, laughing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you afraid of being heard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I said, \"but I am afraid of waking the man who sleeps in the room\\r\\nnext to me, who is not at all well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got near the house I felt as frightened as a man does who is\\r\\ngoing to the dentist\\'s. All the windows were dark, so no doubt everybody\\r\\nwas asleep, and I breathed again. I opened the door as carefully as a\\r\\nthief, let my fair companion in, shut it behind me, and went upstairs on\\r\\ntiptoe, holding my breath, and striking wax-matches lest the girl\\r\\nshould make a false step.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we passed the landlady\\'s door I felt my heart beating very quickly,\\r\\nbut we reached the second floor, then the third, and at last the fifth,\\r\\nand got into my room. Victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I only dared to speak in a whisper, and took off my boots so as\\r\\nnot to make any noise. The tea, which I made over a spirit-lamp, was\\r\\nsoon drunk, and then I became pressing, till little by little, as if in\\r\\nplay, I, one by one, took off my companion\\'s clothes, who yielded while\\r\\nresisting, blushing, confused.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had absolutely nothing more on except a short white petticoat when\\r\\nmy door suddenly opened, and Mme. Kergaran appeared with a candle in her\\r\\nhand, in exactly the same costume as Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nI jumped away from her and remained standing up, looking at the two\\r\\nwomen, who were looking at each other. What was going to happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy landlady said, in a lofty tone of voice which I had never heard from\\r\\nher before:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Monsieur Kervelen, I will not have prostitutes in my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Madame Kergaran,\" I stammered, \"the young lady is a friend of\\r\\nmine. She just came in to have a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People don\\'t take tea in their chemise. You will please make this\\r\\nperson go directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, in a natural state of consternation, began to cry, and hid her\\r\\nface in her petticoat, and I lost my head, not knowing what to do or\\r\\nsay. My landlady added, with irresistible authority:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Help her to dress, and take her out at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly the only thing I could do, so I picked up her dress\\r\\nfrom the floor, put it over her head, and began to fasten it as best I\\r\\ncould. She helped me, crying all the time, hurrying and making all sorts\\r\\nof mistakes and unable to find either buttonholes or laces, while Mme.\\r\\nKergaran stood by motionless, with the candle in her hand, looking at us\\r\\nwith the severity of a judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Emma was dressed, without even stopping to button her boots,\\r\\nshe rushed past the landlady and ran down stairs. I followed her in my\\r\\nslippers and half undressed, and kept repeating: \"Mademoiselle!\\r\\nMademoiselle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I ought to say something to her, but I could not find\\r\\nanything. I overtook her just by the street-door, and tried to take her\\r\\ninto my arms, but she pushed me violently away, saying in a low, nervous\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave me alone, leave me alone!\" and so ran out into the street,\\r\\nclosing the door behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went upstairs again I found that Mme. Kergaran was waiting on the\\r\\nfirst landing, and I went up slowly, expecting, and ready for, anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer door was open, and she called me in, saying in a severe voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to speak to you, M. Kervelen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, with my head bent. She put her candle on the mantelpiece, and\\r\\nthen, folding her arms over her expansive bosom, which a fine white\\r\\ndressing-jacket hardly covered, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Monsieur Kervelen, you think my house is a house of ill-fame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not at all proud. I murmured:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, no! But, Mme. Kergaran, you must not be angry; you know what\\r\\nyoung men are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" was her answer, \"that I will not have such creatures here, so\\r\\nyou will understand that. I expect to have my house respected, and I\\r\\nwill not have it lose its reputation, you understand me? I know....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on thus for at least twenty minutes, overwhelming me with the\\r\\ngood name of her house, with reasons for her indignation, and loading me\\r\\nwith severe reproofs. I went to bed crestfallen, and resolved never\\r\\nagain to try such an experiment, so long, at least, as I continued to be\\r\\na lodger of Mme. Kergaran.',\n"," 'THE HORLA, OR MODERN GHOSTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 8._ What a beautiful day! I have spent all the morning lying in the\\r\\ngrass in front of my house, under the enormous plantain tree which\\r\\ncovers it, and shades and shelters the whole of it. I like this part of\\r\\nthe country and I am fond of living here because I am attached to it by\\r\\ndeep roots, profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil\\r\\non which his ancestors were born and died, which attach him to what\\r\\npeople think and what they eat, to the usages as well as to the food,\\r\\nlocal expressions, the peculiar language of the peasants, to the smell\\r\\nof the soil, of the villages and of the atmosphere itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love my house in which I grew up. From my windows I can see the Seine\\r\\nwhich flows by the side of my garden, on the other side of the road,\\r\\nalmost through my grounds, the great wide Seine, which goes to Rouen and\\r\\nHavre, and which is covered with boats passing to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left, down yonder, lies Rouen, that large town with its blue\\r\\nroofs, under its pointed, Gothic towers. They are innumerable, delicate\\r\\nor broad, dominated by the spire of the cathedral, and full of bells\\r\\nwhich sound through the blue air on fine mornings, sending their sweet\\r\\nand distant iron clang, to me; their metallic sound which the breeze\\r\\nwafts in my direction, now stronger and now weaker, according as the\\r\\nwind is stronger or lighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a delicious morning it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eleven o\\'clock, a long line of boats drawn by a steam-tug, as big\\r\\nas a fly, and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke,\\r\\npassed my gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two English schooners, whose red flag fluttered towards the sky,\\r\\nthere came a magnificent Brazilian three-master; it was perfectly white\\r\\nand wonderfully clean and shining. I saluted it, I hardly know why,\\r\\nexcept that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 12._ I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days, and\\r\\nI feel ill, or rather I feel low-spirited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence do these mysterious influences come, which change our happiness\\r\\ninto discouragement, and our self-confidence into diffidence? One might\\r\\nalmost say that the air, the invisible air, is full of unknowable\\r\\nForces, whose mysterious presence we have to endure. I wake up in the\\r\\nbest spirits, with an inclination to sing in my throat. Why? I go down\\r\\nby the side of the water, and suddenly, after walking a short distance,\\r\\nI return home wretched, as if some misfortune were awaiting me there.\\r\\nWhy? Is it a cold shiver which, passing over my skin, has upset my\\r\\nnerves and given me low spirits? Is it the form of the clouds, or the\\r\\ncolor of the sky, or the color of the surrounding objects which is so\\r\\nchangeable, which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my\\r\\neyes? Who can tell? Everything that surrounds us, everything that we see\\r\\nwithout looking at it, everything that we touch without knowing it,\\r\\neverything that we handle without feeling it, all that we meet without\\r\\nclearly distinguishing it, has a rapid, surprising and inexplicable\\r\\neffect upon us and upon our organs, and through them on our ideas and on\\r\\nour heart itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow profound that mystery of the Invisible is! We cannot fathom it with\\r\\nour miserable senses, with our eyes which are unable to perceive what is\\r\\neither too small or too great, too near to, or too far from us; neither\\r\\nthe inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water ... with our ears that\\r\\ndeceive us, for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air in\\r\\nsonorous notes. They are fairies who work the miracle of changing that\\r\\nmovement into noise, and by that metamorphosis give birth to music,\\r\\nwhich makes the mute agitation of nature musical ... with our sense of\\r\\nsmell which is smaller than that of a dog ... with our sense of taste\\r\\nwhich can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our\\r\\nfavor, what a number of fresh things we might discover around us!\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 16._ I am ill, decidedly! I was so well last month! I am feverish,\\r\\nhorribly feverish, or rather I am in a state of feverish enervation,\\r\\nwhich makes my mind suffer as much as my body. I have without ceasing\\r\\nthat horrible sensation of some danger threatening me, that apprehension\\r\\nof some coming misfortune or of approaching death, that presentiment\\r\\nwhich is, no doubt, an attack of some illness which is still unknown,\\r\\nwhich germinates in the flesh and in the blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 18._ I have just come from consulting my medical man, for I could\\r\\nno longer get any sleep. He found that my pulse was high, my eyes\\r\\ndilated, my nerves highly strung, but no alarming symptoms. I must have\\r\\na course of shower baths and of bromide of potassium.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 25._ No change! My state is really very peculiar. As the evening\\r\\ncomes on, an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me, just as\\r\\nif night concealed some terrible menace towards me. I dine quickly, and\\r\\nthen try to read, but I do not understand the words, and can scarcely\\r\\ndistinguish the letters. Then I walk up and down my drawing-room,\\r\\noppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear, the fear of\\r\\nsleep and fear of my bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten o\\'clock I go up to my room. As soon as I have got in I double\\r\\nlock, and bolt it: I am frightened ... of what? Up till the present time\\r\\nI have been frightened of nothing ... I open my cupboards, and look\\r\\nunder my bed; I listen ... I listen ... to what? How strange it is that\\r\\na simple feeling of discomfort, impeded or heightened circulation,\\r\\nperhaps the irritation of a nervous thread, a slight congestion, a small\\r\\ndisturbance in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living\\r\\nmachinery, can turn the most light-hearted of men into a melancholy one,\\r\\nand make a coward of the bravest? Then, I go to bed, and I wait for\\r\\nsleep as a man might wait for the executioner. I wait for its coming\\r\\nwith dread, and my heart beats and my legs tremble, while my whole body\\r\\nshivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes, until the moment when I\\r\\nsuddenly fall asleep, as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant\\r\\nwater in order to drown oneself. I do not feel as I used to do formerly,\\r\\nthis perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me, which is\\r\\ngoing to seize me by the head, to close my eyes and annihilate me,\\r\\ncoming over me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sleep--a long time--two or three hours perhaps--then a dream--no--a\\r\\nnightmare lays hold on me. I feel that I am in bed and asleep ... I feel\\r\\nit and I know it ... and I feel also that somebody is coming close to\\r\\nme, is looking at me, touching me, is getting on to my bed, is kneeling\\r\\non my chest, is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing it ...\\r\\nsqueezing it with all his might in order to strangle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI struggle, bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in\\r\\nour dreams; I try to cry out--but I cannot; I want to move--I cannot; I\\r\\ntry, with the most violent efforts and out of breath, to turn over and\\r\\nthrow off this being which is crushing and suffocating me--I cannot!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then suddenly, I wake up, shaken and bathed in perspiration; I light\\r\\na candle and find that I am alone, and after that crisis, which occurs\\r\\nevery night, I at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 2._ My state has grown worse. What is the matter with me? The\\r\\nbromide does me no good, and the shower baths have no effect whatever.\\r\\nSometimes, in order to tire myself out, though I am fatigued enough\\r\\nalready, I go for a walk in the forest of Roumare. I used to think at\\r\\nfirst that the fresh light and soft air, impregnated with the odor of\\r\\nherbs and leaves, would instill new blood into my veins and impart fresh\\r\\nenergy to my heart. I turned into a broad ride in the wood, and then I\\r\\nturned towards La Bouille, through a narrow path, between two rows of\\r\\nexceedingly tall trees, which placed a thick, green, almost black roof\\r\\nbetween the sky and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden shiver ran through me, not a cold shiver, but a shiver of\\r\\nagony, and so I hastened my steps, uneasy at being alone in the wood,\\r\\nfrightened stupidly and without reason, at the profound solitude.\\r\\nSuddenly it seemed to me as if I were being followed, that somebody was\\r\\nwalking at my heels, close, quite close to me, near enough to touch me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned round suddenly, but I was alone. I saw nothing behind me except\\r\\nthe straight, broad ride, empty and bordered by high trees, horribly\\r\\nempty; on the other side it also extended until it was lost in the\\r\\ndistance, and looked just the same, terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed my eyes. Why? And then I began to turn round on one heel very\\r\\nquickly, just like a top. I nearly fell down, and opened my eyes; the\\r\\ntrees were dancing round me and the earth heaved; I was obliged to sit\\r\\ndown. Then, ah! I no longer remembered how I had come! What a strange\\r\\nidea! What a strange, strange idea! I did not the least know. I started\\r\\noff to the right, and got back into the avenue which had led me into the\\r\\nmiddle of the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 3._ I have had a terrible night. I shall go away for a few weeks,\\r\\nfor no doubt a journey will set me up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 2._ I have come back, quite cured, and have had a most delightful\\r\\ntrip into the bargain. I have been to Mount Saint-Michel, which I had\\r\\nnot seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a sight, when one arrives as I did, at Avranches towards the end of\\r\\nthe day! The town stands on a hill, and I was taken into the public\\r\\ngarden at the extremity of the town. I uttered a cry of astonishment. An\\r\\nextraordinarily large bay lay extended before me, as far as my eyes\\r\\ncould reach, between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist; and\\r\\nin the middle of this immense yellow bay, under a clear, golden sky, a\\r\\npeculiar hill rose up, somber and pointed in the midst of the sand. The\\r\\nsun had just disappeared, and under the still flaming sky the outline\\r\\nof that fantastic rock stood out, which bears on its summit a fantastic\\r\\nmonument.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak I went to it. The tide was low as it had been the night\\r\\nbefore, and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as I approached\\r\\nit. After several hours walking, I reached the enormous mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich supports the little town, dominated by the great church. Having\\r\\nclimbed the steep and narrow street, I entered the most wonderful Gothic\\r\\nbuilding that has ever been built to God on earth, as large as a town,\\r\\nfull of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs, and lofty\\r\\ngalleries supported by delicate columns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of\\r\\nlace, covered with towers, with slender belfries to which spiral\\r\\nstaircases ascend, and which raise their strange heads that bristle with\\r\\nchimeras, with devils, with fantastic animals, with monstrous flowers,\\r\\nand which are joined together by finely carved arches, to the blue sky\\r\\nby day, and to the black sky by night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the summit, I said to the monk who accompanied me:\\r\\n\"Father, how happy you must be here!\" And he replied: \"It is very windy,\\r\\nMonsieur;\" and so we began to talk while watching the rising tide, which\\r\\nran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the monk told me stories, all the old stories belonging to the\\r\\nplace, legends, nothing but legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them struck me forcibly. The country people, those belonging to\\r\\nthe Mornet, declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the\\r\\nsand, and then that one hears two goats bleat, one with a strong, the\\r\\nother with a weak voice. Incredulous people declare that it is nothing\\r\\nbut the cry of the sea birds, which occasionally resembles bleatings,\\r\\nand occasionally human lamentations; but belated fishermen swear that\\r\\nthey have met an old shepherd, whose head, which is covered by his\\r\\ncloak, they can never see, wandering on the downs, between two tides,\\r\\nround the little town placed so far out of the world, and who is guiding\\r\\nand walking before them, a he-goat with a man\\'s face, and a she-goat\\r\\nwith a woman\\'s face, and both of them with white hair; and talking\\r\\nincessantly, quarreling in a strange language, and then suddenly ceasing\\r\\nto talk in order to bleat with all their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you believe it?\" I asked the monk. \"I scarcely know,\" he replied,\\r\\nand I continued: \"If there are other beings besides ourselves on this\\r\\nearth, how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time, or why\\r\\nhave you not seen them? How is it that I have not seen them?\" He\\r\\nreplied: \"Do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists? Look\\r\\nhere; there is the wind, which is the strongest force in nature, which\\r\\nknocks down men, and blows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea\\r\\ninto mountains of water, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the\\r\\nbreakers; the wind which kills, which whistles, which sighs, which\\r\\nroars,--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It exists for all\\r\\nthat, however.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was silent before this simple reasoning. That man was a philosopher,\\r\\nor perhaps a fool; I could not say which exactly, so I held my tongue.\\r\\nWhat he had said, had often been in my own thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 3._ I have slept badly; certainly there is some feverish influence\\r\\nhere, for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I am. When I went\\r\\nback home yesterday, I noticed his singular paleness, and I asked him:\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, Jean?\" \"The matter is that I never get any\\r\\nrest, and my nights devour my days. Since your departure, Monsieur,\\r\\nthere has been a spell over me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the other servants are all well, but I am very frightened of\\r\\nhaving another attack, myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 4._ I am decidedly taken again; for my old nightmares have\\r\\nreturned. Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my\\r\\nlife from between my lips with his mouth. Yes, he was sucking it out of\\r\\nmy neck, like a leech would have done. Then he got up, satiated, and I\\r\\nwoke up, so beaten, crushed and annihilated that I could not move. If\\r\\nthis continues for a few days, I shall certainly go away again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 5._ Have I lost my reason? What has happened, what I saw last\\r\\nnight is so strange, that my head wanders when I think of it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I do now every evening, I had locked my door, and then, being\\r\\nthirsty, I drank half a glass of water, and I accidentally noticed that\\r\\nthe water-bottle was full up to the cut-glass stopper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps, from which I\\r\\nwas aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes\\r\\nup with a knife in his chest, and who is rattling in his throat, covered\\r\\nwith blood, and who can no longer breathe and is going to die and does\\r\\nnot understand anything at all about it--there it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recovered my senses, I was thirsty again, so I lit a candle and\\r\\nwent to the table on which my water-bottle was. I lifted it up and\\r\\ntilted it over my glass, but nothing came out. It was empty! It was\\r\\ncompletely empty! At first I could not understand it at all, and then\\r\\nsuddenly I was seized by such a terrible feeling that I had to sit down,\\r\\nor rather I fell into a chair! Then I sprang up with a bound to look\\r\\nabout me, and then I sat down again, overcome by astonishment and fear,\\r\\nin front of the transparent crystal bottle! I looked at it with fixed\\r\\neyes, trying to conjecture, and my hands trembled! Somebody had drunk\\r\\nthe water, but who? I? I without any doubt. It could surely only be I?\\r\\nIn that case I was a somnambulist. I lived, without knowing it, that\\r\\ndouble mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not two\\r\\nbeings in us, or whether a strange, unknowable and invisible being does\\r\\nnot at such moments, when our soul is in a state of torpor, animate our\\r\\ncaptive body which obeys this other being, as it does us ourselves, and\\r\\nmore than it does ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! Who will understand my horrible agony? Who will understand the\\r\\nemotion of a man who is sound in mind, wide awake, full of sound sense,\\r\\nand who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has\\r\\ndisappeared while he was asleep, through the glass of a water-bottle!\\r\\nAnd I remained there until it was daylight, without venturing to go to\\r\\nbed again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 6._ I am going mad. Again all the contents of my water-bottle have\\r\\nbeen drunk during the night;--or rather, I have drunk it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is it I? Is it I? Who could it be? Who? Oh! God! Am I going mad? Who\\r\\nwill save me?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 10._ I have just been through some surprising ordeals. Decidedly I\\r\\nam mad! And yet!...\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, before going to bed, I put some wine, milk, water, bread and\\r\\nstrawberries on my table. Somebody drank--I drank--all the water and a\\r\\nlittle of the milk, but neither the wine, bread nor the strawberries\\r\\nwere touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment, with the same\\r\\nresults, and on July 8, I left out the water and the milk and nothing\\r\\nwas touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, on July 9 I put only water and milk on my table, taking care to\\r\\nwrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers. Then I\\r\\nrubbed my lips, my beard and my hands with pencil lead, and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrresistible sleep seized me, which was soon followed by a terrible\\r\\nawakening. I had not moved, and my sheets were not marked. I rushed to\\r\\nthe table. The muslin round the bottles remained intact; I undid the\\r\\nstring, trembling with fear. All the water had been drunk, and so had\\r\\nthe milk! Ah! Great God!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI must start for Paris immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 12._ Paris. I must have lost my head during the last few days! I\\r\\nmust be the plaything of my enervated imagination, unless I am really a\\r\\nsomnambulist, or that I have been brought under the power of one of\\r\\nthose influences which have been proved to exist, but which have\\r\\nhitherto been inexplicable, which are called suggestions. In any case,\\r\\nmy mental state bordered on madness, and twenty-four hours of Paris\\r\\nsufficed to restore me to my equilibrium.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which\\r\\ninstilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me, I wound up my\\r\\nevening at the _Théâtre-Français_. A play by Alexandre Dumas the\\r\\nYounger was being acted, and his active and powerful mind completed my\\r\\ncure. Certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds. We require men\\r\\nwho can think and can talk, around us. When we are alone for a long\\r\\ntime, we people space with phantoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits. Amid\\r\\nthe jostling of the crowd I thought, not without irony, of my terrors\\r\\nand surmises of the previous week, because I believed, yes, I believed,\\r\\nthat an invisible being lived beneath my roof. How weak our head is, and\\r\\nhow quickly it is terrified and goes astray, as soon as we are struck by\\r\\na small, incomprehensible fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of concluding with these simple words: \"I do not understand\\r\\nbecause the cause escapes me,\" we immediately imagine terrible mysteries\\r\\nand supernatural powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 14._ _Fête_ of the Republic. I walked through the streets, and the\\r\\ncrackers and flags amused me like a child. Still it is very foolish to\\r\\nbe merry on a fixed date, by a Government decree. The populace, an\\r\\nimbecile flock of sheep, now steadily patient, and now in ferocious\\r\\nrevolt. Say to it: \"Amuse yourself,\" and it amuses itself. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Go and fight with your neighbor,\" and it goes and fights. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Vote for the Emperor,\" and it votes for the Emperor, and then say to\\r\\nit: \"Vote for the Republic,\" and it votes for the Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who direct it are also stupid; but instead of obeying men, they\\r\\nobey principles, which can only be stupid, sterile and false, for the\\r\\nvery reason that they are principles, that is to say, ideas which are\\r\\nconsidered as certain and unchangeable, in this world where one is\\r\\ncertain of nothing, since light is an illusion and noise is an illusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 16._ I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was dining with my cousin Madame Sablé, whose husband is colonel of\\r\\nthe 76th Chasseurs at Limoges. There were two young women there, one of\\r\\nwhom had married a medical man, Dr. Parent, who devotes himself a great\\r\\ndeal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which\\r\\nat this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe related to us at some length the remarkable results obtained by\\r\\nEnglish scientists and the doctors of the medical school at Nancy, and\\r\\nthe facts which he adduced, appeared to me so strange, that I declared\\r\\nthat I was altogether incredulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are,\" he declared, \"on the point of discovering one of the most\\r\\nimportant secrets of nature, I mean to say, one of its most important\\r\\nsecrets on this earth, for there are certainly some which are of a\\r\\ndifferent kind of importance up in the stars, yonder. Ever since man has\\r\\nthought, since he has been able to express and write down his thoughts,\\r\\nhe has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable to his\\r\\ncoarse and imperfect senses, and he endeavors to supplement the want of\\r\\npower of his organs, by the efforts of his intellect. As long as that\\r\\nintellect still remained in its elementary stage, this intercourse with\\r\\ninvisible spirits, assumed forms which were commonplace though\\r\\nterrifying. Thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural, the\\r\\nlegends of wandering spirits, of fairies, of gnomes, ghosts, I might\\r\\neven say the legend of God, for our conceptions of the workman-creator,\\r\\nfrom whatever religion they may have come down to us, are certainly the\\r\\nmost mediocre, the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that\\r\\never sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures. Nothing is\\r\\ntruer than what Voltaire says: \\'God made man in His own image, but man\\r\\nhas certainly paid Him back again.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for rather more than a century, men seem to have had a presentiment\\r\\nof something new. Mesmer and some others have put us on an unexpected\\r\\ntrack, and especially within the last two or three years, we have\\r\\narrived at really surprising results.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who is also very incredulous, smiled, and Doctor Parent said\\r\\nto her: \"Would you like me to try and send you to sleep, Madame?\" \"Yes,\\r\\ncertainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in an easy-chair, and he began to look at her fixedly, so\\r\\nas to fascinate her. I suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable, with\\r\\na beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat. I saw that Madame\\r\\nSablé\\'s eyes were growing heavy, her mouth twitched and her bosom\\r\\nheaved, and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand behind her,\" the doctor said to me, and so I took a seat behind\\r\\nher. He put a visiting-card into her hands, and said to her: \"This is a\\r\\nlooking-glass; what do you see in it?\" And she replied: \"I see my\\r\\ncousin.\" \"What is he doing?\" \"He is twisting his moustache.\" \"And now?\"\\r\\n\"He is taking a photograph out of his pocket.\" \"Whose photograph is it?\"\\r\\n\"His own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was true, and that photograph had been given me that same evening\\r\\nat the hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is his attitude in this portrait?\" \"He is standing up with his hat\\r\\nin his hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she saw on that card, on that piece of white paste-board, as if she\\r\\nhad seen it in a looking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young women were frightened, and exclaimed: \"That is quite enough!\\r\\nQuite, quite enough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the doctor said to her authoritatively: \"You will get up at eight\\r\\no\\'clock to-morrow morning; then you will go and call on your cousin at\\r\\nhis hotel and ask him to lend you five thousands francs which your\\r\\nhusband demands of you, and which he will ask for when he sets out on\\r\\nhis coming journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn returning to my hotel, I thought over this curious _séance_ and I was\\r\\nassailed by doubts, not as to my cousin\\'s absolute and undoubted good\\r\\nfaith, for I had known her as well as if she had been my own sister ever\\r\\nsince she was a child, but as to a possible trick on the doctor\\'s part.\\r\\nHad not he, perhaps, kept a glass hidden in his hand, which he showed to\\r\\nthe young woman in her sleep, at the same time as he did the card?\\r\\nProfessional conjurors do things which are just as singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I went home and to bed, and this morning, at about half past eight, I\\r\\nwas awakened by my footman, who said to me: \"Madame Sablé has asked to\\r\\nsee you immediately, Monsieur,\" so I dressed hastily and went to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in some agitation, with her eyes on the floor, and without\\r\\nraising her veil she said to me: \"My dear cousin, I am going to ask a\\r\\ngreat favor of you.\" \"What is it, cousin?\" \"I do not like to tell you,\\r\\nand yet I must. I am in absolute want of five thousand francs.\" \"What,\\r\\nyou?\" \"Yes, I, or rather my husband, who has asked me to procure the\\r\\nmoney for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so stupefied that I stammered out my answers. I asked myself\\r\\nwhether she had not really been making fun of me with Doctor Parent, if\\r\\nit were not merely a very well-acted farce which had been got up\\r\\nbeforehand. On looking at her attentively, however, my doubts\\r\\ndisappeared. She was trembling with grief, so painful was this step to\\r\\nher, and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that she was very rich and so I continued: \"What! Has not your\\r\\nhusband five thousand francs at his disposal! Come, think. Are you sure\\r\\nthat he commissioned you to ask me for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated for a few seconds, as if she were making a great effort to\\r\\nsearch her memory, and then she replied: \"Yes ... yes, I am quite sure\\r\\nof it.\" \"He has written to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again and reflected, and I guessed the torture of her\\r\\nthoughts. She did not know. She only knew that she was to borrow five\\r\\nthousand francs of me for her husband. So she told a lie. \"Yes, he has\\r\\nwritten to me.\" \"When pray? You did not mention it to me yesterday.\" \"I\\r\\nreceived his letter this morning.\" \"Can you show it me?\" \"No; no ... no\\r\\n... it contained private matters ... things too personal to ourselves\\r\\n... I burnt it.\" \"So your husband runs into debt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again, and then murmured: \"I do not know.\" Thereupon I\\r\\nsaid bluntly: \"I have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this\\r\\nmoment, my dear cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a kind of a cry as if she were in pain and said: \"Oh! oh I\\r\\nbeseech you, I beseech you to get them for me....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me! I\\r\\nheard her voice change its tone; she wept and stammered, harassed and\\r\\ndominated by the irresistible order that she had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! oh! I beg you to ... if you knew what I am suffering.... I want\\r\\nthem to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had pity on her: \"You shall have them by and by, I swear to you.\" \"Oh!\\r\\nthank you! thank you! How kind you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI continued: \"Do you remember what took place at your house last night?\"\\r\\n\"Yes.\" \"Do you remember that Doctor Parent sent you to sleep?\" \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Very well then; he ordered you to come to me this morning to borrow\\r\\nfive thousand francs, and at this moment you are obeying that\\r\\nsuggestion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered for a few moments, and then replied: \"But as it is my\\r\\nhusband who wants them....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a whole hour I tried to convince her, but could not succeed, and\\r\\nwhen she had gone I went to the doctor. He was just going out, and he\\r\\nlistened to me with a smile, and said: \"Do you believe now?\" \"Yes, I\\r\\ncannot help it.\" \"Let us go to your cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was already dozing on a couch, overcome with fatigue. The doctor\\r\\nfelt her pulse, looked at her for some time with one hand raised towards\\r\\nher eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of\\r\\nthis magnetic influence, and when she was asleep, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer! You\\r\\nmust, therefore, forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you,\\r\\nand, if he speaks to you about it, you will not understand him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up, and I took out a pocketbook and said: \"Here is what\\r\\nyou asked me for this morning, my dear cousin.\" But she was so\\r\\nsurprised, that I did not venture to persist; nevertheless, I tried to\\r\\nrecall the circumstance to her, but she denied it vigorously, thought\\r\\nthat I was making fun of her, and in the end, very nearly lost her\\r\\ntemper.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere! I have just come back, and I have not been able to eat any lunch,\\r\\nfor this experiment has altogether upset me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 19._ Many people to whom I have told the adventure, have laughed\\r\\nat me. I no longer know what to think. The wise man says: Perhaps?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 21._ I dined at Bougival, and then I spent the evening at a\\r\\nboatmen\\'s ball. Decidedly everything depends on place and surroundings.\\r\\nIt would be the height of folly to believe in the supernatural on the\\r\\n_île de la Grenouillière_[15] ... but on the top of Mont\\r\\nSaint-Michel?... and in India? We are terribly under the influence of\\r\\nour surroundings. I shall return home next week.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 30._ I came back to my own house yesterday. Everything is going on\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 2._ Nothing new. It is splendid weather, and I spent my days in\\r\\nwatching the Seine flow past.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 4._ Quarrels among my servants. They declare that the glasses\\r\\nare broken in the cupboards at night. The footman accuses the cook, who\\r\\naccuses the needle woman, who accuses the other two. Who is the culprit?\\r\\nA clever person, to be able to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 6._ This time, I am not mad. I have seen ... I have seen ... I\\r\\nhave seen!... I can doubt no longer ... I have seen it!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI was walking at two o\\'clock among my rose trees, in the full sunlight\\r\\n... in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall. As\\r\\nI stopped to look at a _Géant de Bataille_, which had three splendid\\r\\nblooms, I distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend, close to\\r\\nme, as if an invisible hand had bent it, and then break, as if that hand\\r\\nhad picked it! Then the flower raised itself, following the curve which\\r\\na hand would have described in carrying it towards a mouth, and it\\r\\nremained suspended in the transparent air, all alone and motionless, a\\r\\nterrible red spot, three yards from my eyes. In desperation I rushed at\\r\\nit to take it! I found nothing; it had disappeared. Then I was seized\\r\\nwith furious rage against myself, for it is not allowable for a\\r\\nreasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was it a hallucination? I turned round to look for the stalk, and I\\r\\nfound it immediately under the bush, freshly broken, between two other\\r\\nroses which remained on the branch, and I returned home then, with a\\r\\nmuch disturbed mind; for I am certain now, as certain as I am of the\\r\\nalternation of day and night, that there exists close to me an invisible\\r\\nbeing that lives on milk and on water, which can touch objects, take\\r\\nthem and change their places; which is, consequently, endowed with a\\r\\nmaterial nature, although it is imperceptible to our senses, and which\\r\\nlives as I do, under my roof....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 7._ I slept tranquilly. He drank the water out of my decanter,\\r\\nbut did not disturb my sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask myself whether I am mad. As I was walking just now in the sun by\\r\\nthe river side, doubts as to my own sanity arose in me; not vague doubts\\r\\nsuch as I have had hitherto, but precise and absolute doubts. I have\\r\\nseen mad people, and I have known some who have been quite intelligent,\\r\\nlucid, even clear-sighted in every concern of life, except on one point.\\r\\nThey spoke clearly, readily, profoundly on everything, when suddenly\\r\\ntheir thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and broke to\\r\\npieces there, and were dispersed and foundered in that furious and\\r\\nterrible sea, full of bounding waves, fogs and squalls, which is called\\r\\n_madness_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI certainly should think that I was mad, absolutely mad, if I were not\\r\\nconscious, did not perfectly know my state, if I did not fathom it by\\r\\nanalyzing it with the most complete lucidity. I should, in fact, be a\\r\\nreasonable man who was laboring under a hallucination. Some unknown\\r\\ndisturbance must have been excited in my brain, one of those\\r\\ndisturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to\\r\\nfix precisely, and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in\\r\\nmy mind and in the order and logic of my ideas. Similar phenomena occur\\r\\nin the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria,\\r\\nwithout causing us any surprise, because our verifying apparatus and our\\r\\nsense of control has gone to sleep, while our imaginative faculty wakes\\r\\nand works. Is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the\\r\\ncerebral finger-board has been paralyzed in me? Some men lose the\\r\\nrecollection of proper names, or of verbs or of numbers or merely of\\r\\ndates, in consequence of an accident. The localization of all the\\r\\nparticles of thought has been proved nowadays; what then would there be\\r\\nsurprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of\\r\\ncertain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being!\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water. The sun was\\r\\nshining brightly on the river and made earth delightful, while it filled\\r\\nmy looks with love for life, for the swallows, whose agility is always\\r\\ndelightful in my eyes, for the plants by the riverside, whose rustling\\r\\nis a pleasure to my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees, however, an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me. It\\r\\nseemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me, were\\r\\npreventing me from going further and were calling me back. I felt that\\r\\npainful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a beloved\\r\\ninvalid at home, and when you are seized by a presentiment that he is\\r\\nworse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, returned in spite of myself, feeling certain that I should\\r\\nfind some bad news awaiting me, a letter or a telegram. There was\\r\\nnothing, however, and I was more surprised and uneasy than if I had had\\r\\nanother fantastic vision.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 8._ I spent a terrible evening, yesterday. He does not show\\r\\nhimself any more, but I feel that he is near me, watching me, looking at\\r\\nme, penetrating me, dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides\\r\\nhimself thus, than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible\\r\\npresence by supernatural phenomena. However, I slept.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 9._ Nothing, but I am afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 10._ Nothing; what will happen to-morrow?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 11._ Still nothing; I cannot stop at home with this fear hanging\\r\\nover me and these thoughts in my mind; I shall go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 12._ Ten o\\'clock at night. All day long I have been trying to\\r\\nget away, and have not been able. I wished to accomplish this simple and\\r\\neasy act of liberty--go out--get into my carriage in order to go to\\r\\nRouen--and I have not been able to do it. What is the reason?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 13._ When one is attacked by certain maladies, all the springs\\r\\nof our physical being appear to be broken, all our energies destroyed,\\r\\nall our muscles relaxed, our bones to have become as soft as our flesh,\\r\\nand our blood as liquid as water. I am experiencing that condition in my\\r\\nmoral being in a strange and distressing manner. I have no longer any\\r\\nstrength, any courage, any self-control, nor even any power to set my\\r\\nown will in motion. I have no power left to _will_ anything, but some\\r\\none does it for me and I obey.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 14._ I am lost! Somebody possesses my soul and governs it!\\r\\nSomebody orders all my acts, all my movements, all my thoughts. I am no\\r\\nlonger anything in myself, nothing except an enslaved and terrified\\r\\nspectator of all the things which I do. I wish to go out; I cannot. He\\r\\ndoes not wish to, and so I remain, trembling and distracted in the\\r\\narmchair in which he keeps me sitting. I merely wish to get up and to\\r\\nrouse myself, so as to think that I am still master of myself: I cannot!\\r\\nI am riveted to my chair, and my chair adheres to the ground in such a\\r\\nmanner that no force could move us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly, I must, I must go to the bottom of my garden to pick some\\r\\nstrawberries and eat them, and I go there. I pick the strawberries and I\\r\\neat them! Oh! my God! my God! Is there a God? If there be one, deliver\\r\\nme! save me! succor me! Pardon! Pity! Mercy! Save me! Oh! what\\r\\nsufferings! what torture! what horror!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 15._ Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was\\r\\npossessed and swayed, when she came to borrow five thousand francs of\\r\\nme. She was under the power of a strange will which had entered into\\r\\nher, like another soul, like another parasitic and ruling soul. Is the\\r\\nworld coming to an end?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who is he, this invisible being that rules me. This unknowable\\r\\nbeing, this rover of a supernatural race?\\r\\n\\r\\nInvisible beings exist, then! How is it then that since the beginning of\\r\\nthe world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner\\r\\nprecisely as they do to me? I have never read anything which resembles\\r\\nwhat goes on in my house. Oh! If I could only leave it, if I could only\\r\\ngo away and flee, so as never to return. I should be saved, but I\\r\\ncannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 16._ I managed to escape to-day for two hours, like a prisoner\\r\\nwho finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open. I suddenly felt\\r\\nthat I was free and that he was far away, and so I gave orders to put\\r\\nthe horses in as quickly as possible, and I drove to Rouen. Oh! How\\r\\ndelightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you: \"Go to Rouen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI made him pull up before the library, and I begged them to lend me Dr.\\r\\nHerrmann Herestauss\\'s treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient\\r\\nand modern world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting into my carriage, I intended to say: \"To the\\r\\nrailway station!\" but instead of this I shouted,--I did not say, but I\\r\\nshouted--in such a loud voice that all the passers-by turned round:\\r\\n\"Home!\" and I fell back onto the cushion of my carriage, overcome by\\r\\nmental agony. He had found me out and regained possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 17._ Oh! What a night! what a night! And yet it seems to me that\\r\\nI ought to rejoice. I read until one o\\'clock in the morning! Herestauss,\\r\\nDoctor of Philosophy and Theogony, wrote the history and the\\r\\nmanifestations of all those invisible beings which hover around man, or\\r\\nof whom he dreams. He describes their origin, their domains, their\\r\\npower; but none of them resembles the one which haunts me. One might say\\r\\nthat man, ever since he has thought, has had a foreboding of, and feared\\r\\na new being, stronger than himself, his successor in this world, and\\r\\nthat, feeling him near, and not being able to foretell the nature of\\r\\nthat master, he has, in his terror, created the whole race of hidden\\r\\nbeings, of vague phantoms born of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving, therefore, read until one o\\'clock in the morning, I went and sat\\r\\ndown at the open window, in order to cool my forehead and my thoughts,\\r\\nin the calm night air. It was very pleasant and warm! How I should have\\r\\nenjoyed such a night formerly!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no moon, but the stars darted out their rays in the dark\\r\\nheavens. Who inhabits those worlds? What forms, what living beings, what\\r\\nanimals are there yonder? What do those who are thinkers in those\\r\\ndistant worlds, know more than we do? What can they do more than we can?\\r\\nWhat do they see which we do not know? Will not one of them, some day or\\r\\nother, traversing space, appear on our earth to conquer it, just as the\\r\\nNorsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations more\\r\\nfeeble than themselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are so weak, so unarmed, so ignorant, so small, we who live on this\\r\\nparticle of mud which turns round in a drop of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell asleep, dreaming thus in the cool night air, and then, having\\r\\nslept for about three quarters of an hour, I opened my eyes without\\r\\nmoving, awakened by I know not what confused and strange sensation. At\\r\\nfirst I saw nothing, and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page of\\r\\na book which had remained open on my table, turned over of its own\\r\\naccord. Not a breath of air had come in at my window, and I was\\r\\nsurprised and waited. In about four minutes, I saw, I saw, yes I saw\\r\\nwith my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the\\r\\nothers, as if a finger had turned it over. My armchair was empty,\\r\\nappeared empty, but I knew that he was there, he, and sitting in my\\r\\nplace, and that he was reading. With a furious bound, the bound of an\\r\\nenraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer, I crossed my\\r\\nroom to seize him, to strangle him, to kill him!... But before I could\\r\\nreach it, my chair fell over as if somebody had ran away from me ... my\\r\\ntable rocked, my lamp fell and went out, and my window closed as if some\\r\\nthief had been surprised and had fled out into the night, shutting it\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he had run away: he had been afraid: he, afraid of me!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ... so ... to-morrow ... or later ... some day or other ... I should\\r\\nbe able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground! Do\\r\\nnot dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 18._ I have been thinking the whole day long. Oh! yes, I will\\r\\nobey him, follow his impulses, fulfill all his wishes, show myself\\r\\nhumble, submissive, a coward. He is the stronger; but an hour will\\r\\ncome....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I know, ... I know ... I know all! I have just read the\\r\\nfollowing in the _Revue du Monde Scientifique_: \"A curious piece of news\\r\\ncomes to us from Rio de Janeiro. Madness, an epidemic of madness, which\\r\\nmay be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the people of\\r\\nEurope in the Middle Ages, is at this moment raging in the Province of\\r\\nSan-Paulo. The frightened inhabitants are leaving their houses,\\r\\ndeserting their villages, abandoning their land, saying that they are\\r\\npursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by invisible, though\\r\\ntangible beings, a species of vampire, which feed on their life while\\r\\nthey are asleep, and who, besides, drink water and milk without\\r\\nappearing to touch any other nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Professor Don Pedro Henriques, accompanied by several medical savants,\\r\\nhas gone to the Province of San-Paulo, in order to study the origin and\\r\\nthe manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot, and to\\r\\npropose such measures to the Emperor as may appear to him to be most\\r\\nfitted to restore the mad population to reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! Ah! I remember now that fine Brazilian three-master which passed in\\r\\nfront of my windows as it was going up the Seine, on the 8th of last\\r\\nMay! I thought it looked so pretty, so white and bright! That Being was\\r\\non board of her, coming from there, where its race sprang from. And it\\r\\nsaw me! It saw my house which was also white, and he sprang from the\\r\\nship onto the land. Oh! Good heavens!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I know, I can divine. The reign of man is over, and he has come. He\\r\\nwhom disquieted priests exorcised, whom sorcerers evoked on dark nights,\\r\\nwithout yet seeing him appear, to whom the presentiments of the\\r\\ntransient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful forms\\r\\nof gnomes, spirits, genii, fairies and familiar spirits. After the\\r\\ncoarse conceptions of primitive fear, more clear-sighted men foresaw it\\r\\nmore clearly. Mesmer divined him, and ten years ago physicians\\r\\naccurately discovered the nature of his power, even before he exercised\\r\\nit himself. They played with that weapon of their new Lord, the sway of\\r\\na mysterious will over the human soul, which had become enslaved. They\\r\\ncalled it magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion ... what do I know? I have\\r\\nseen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this horrible\\r\\npower! Woe to us! Woe to man! He has come, the ... the ... what does he\\r\\ncall himself ... the ... I fancy that he is shouting out his name to me\\r\\nand I do not hear him ... the ... yes ... he is shouting it out ... I am\\r\\nlistening ... I cannot ... repeat ... it ... Horla ... I have heard ...\\r\\nthe Horla, ... it is he ... the Horla ... he has come!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! the vulture has eaten the pigeon, the wolf has eaten the lamb; the\\r\\nlion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns; man has killed the lion\\r\\nwith an arrow, with a sword, with gunpowder; but the Horla will make of\\r\\nman what we have made of the horse and of the ox: his chattel, his slave\\r\\nand his food, by the mere of his will. Woe to us!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, nevertheless, the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who\\r\\nhas subjugated it.... I should also like ... I shall be able to ... but\\r\\nI must know him, touch him, see him! Learned men say that beasts\\' eyes,\\r\\nas they differ from ours, do not distinguish like ours do.... And my eye\\r\\ncannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Oh! Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont Saint-Michel: \"Can\\r\\nwe see the hundred-thousandth part of what exists? Look here; there is\\r\\nthe wind which is the strongest force in nature, which knocks men, and\\r\\nblows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea into mountains of\\r\\nwater, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers; the wind\\r\\nwhich kills, which whistles, which sighs, which roars,--have you ever\\r\\nseen it, and can you see it? It exists for all that, however!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I went on thinking: my eyes are so weak, so imperfect, that they do\\r\\nnot even distinguish hard bodies, if they are as transparent as\\r\\nglass!... If a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way, I\\r\\nshould run into it, just like a bird which has flown into a room breaks\\r\\nits head against the windowpanes. A thousand things, moreover, deceive\\r\\nhim and lead him astray. How should it then be surprising that he cannot\\r\\nperceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new being! Why not? It was assuredly bound to come! Why should we be\\r\\nthe last? We do not distinguish it, like all the others created before\\r\\nus? The reason is, that its nature is more perfect, its body finer and\\r\\nmore finished than ours, that ours is so weak, so awkwardly conceived,\\r\\nencumbered with organs that are always tired, always on the strain like\\r\\nlocks that are too complicated, which lives like a plant and like a\\r\\nbeast, nourishing itself with difficulty on air, herbs and flesh, an\\r\\nanimal machine, which is a prey to maladies, to malformations, to decay;\\r\\nbroken-winded, badly regulated, simple and eccentric, ingeniously badly\\r\\nmade, a coarse and a delicate work, the outline of a being which might\\r\\nbecome intelligent and grand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are only a few, so few in this world, from the oyster up to man. Why\\r\\nshould there not be one more, when once that period is accomplished\\r\\nwhich separates the successive apparitions from all the different\\r\\nspecies?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not one more? Why not, also, other trees with immense, splendid\\r\\nflowers, perfuming whole regions? Why not other elements besides fire,\\r\\nair, earth and water? There are four, only four, those nursing fathers\\r\\nof various beings! What a pity! Why are they not forty, four hundred,\\r\\nfour thousand! How poor everything is, how mean and wretched! grudgingly\\r\\ngiven, dryly invented, clumsily made! Ah! the elephant and the\\r\\nhippopotamus, what grace! And the camel, what elegance!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, the butterfly you will say, a flying flower! I dream of one that\\r\\nshould be as large as a hundred worlds, with wings whose shape, beauty,\\r\\ncolors and motion I cannot even express. But I see it ... it flutters\\r\\nfrom star to star, refreshing them and perfuming them with the light and\\r\\nharmonious breath of its flight!... And the people up there look at it\\r\\nas it passes in an ecstacy of delight!...\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the matter with me? It is he, the Horla, who haunts me, and who\\r\\nmakes me think of these foolish things! He is within me, he is becoming\\r\\nmy soul; I shall kill him!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I shall kill him. I have seen him! Yesterday I sat down at\\r\\nmy table and pretended to write very assiduously. I knew quite well that\\r\\nhe would come prowling round me, quite close to me, so close that I\\r\\nmight perhaps be able to touch him, to seize him. And then!... then I\\r\\nshould have the strength of desperation; I should have my hands, my\\r\\nknees, my chest, my forehead, my teeth to strangle him, to crush him, to\\r\\nbite him, to tear him to pieces. And I watched for him with all my\\r\\noverexcited organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece,\\r\\nas if, by this light, I could have discovered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy bed, my old oak bed with its columns was opposite to me; on my right\\r\\nwas the fireplace; on my left the door, which was carefully closed,\\r\\nafter I had left it open for some time, in order to attract him; behind\\r\\nme was a very high wardrobe with a looking-glass in it, which served me\\r\\nto dress by every day, and in which I was in the habit of looking at\\r\\nmyself from head to foot every time I passed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I pretended to be writing in order to deceive him, for he also was\\r\\nwatching me, and suddenly I felt, I was certain that he was reading over\\r\\nmy shoulder, that he was there, almost touching my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got up so quickly, with my hands extended, that I almost fell. Eh!\\r\\nwell?... It was as bright as at midday, but I did not see myself in the\\r\\nglass!... It was empty, clear, profound, full of light! But my figure\\r\\nwas not reflected in it ... and I, I was opposite to it! I saw the\\r\\nlarge, clear glass from top to bottom, and I looked at it with unsteady\\r\\neyes; and I did not dare to advance; I did not venture to make a\\r\\nmovement, nevertheless, feeling perfectly that he was there, but that he\\r\\nwould escape me again, he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow frightened I was! And then suddenly I began to see myself through a\\r\\nmist in the depths of the looking-glass, in a mist as it were through a\\r\\nsheet of water; and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing slowly\\r\\nfrom left to right, and making my figure clearer every moment. It was\\r\\nlike the end of an eclipse. Whatever it was that hid me, did not appear\\r\\nto possess any clearly defined outlines, but a sort of opaque\\r\\ntransparency, which gradually grew clearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I was able to distinguish myself completely, as I do every day\\r\\nwhen I look at myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen it! And the horror of it remained with me, and makes me\\r\\nshudder even now.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 20._ How could I kill it, as I could not get hold of it? Poison?\\r\\nBut it would see me mix it with the water; and then, would our poisons\\r\\nhave any effect on its impalpable body? No ... no ... no doubt about the\\r\\nmatter ... Then? ... then?...\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 21._ I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen, and ordered iron\\r\\nshutters of him for my room, such as some private hotels in Paris have\\r\\non the ground floor, for fear of thieves, and he is going to make me a\\r\\nsimilar door as well. I have made myself out as a coward, but I do not\\r\\ncare about that!...\\r\\n\\r\\n_September 10._ Rouen, Hotel Continental. It is done; ... it is\\r\\ndone.... But is he dead? My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, then, yesterday, the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and\\r\\ndoor, I left everything open until midnight, although it was getting\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I felt that he was there, and joy, mad joy took possession of\\r\\nme. I got up softly, and I walked to the right and left for sometime, so\\r\\nthat he might not guess anything; then I took off my boots and put on my\\r\\nslippers carelessly; then I fastened the iron shutters and going back to\\r\\nthe door quickly I double-locked it with a padlock, putting the key into\\r\\nmy pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed that he was moving restlessly round me, that in his\\r\\nturn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out. I nearly\\r\\nyielded, though I did not yet, but putting my back to the door, I half\\r\\nopened, just enough to allow me to go out backwards, and as I am very\\r\\ntall, my head touched the lintel. I was sure that he had not been able\\r\\nto escape, and I shut him up quite alone, quite alone. What happiness! I\\r\\nhad him fast. Then I ran downstairs; in the drawing-room, which was\\r\\nunder my bedroom, I took the two lamps and I poured all the oil onto the\\r\\ncarpet, the furniture, everywhere; then I set the fire to it and made my\\r\\nescape, after having carefully double-locked the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden, in a clump of laurel\\r\\nbushes. How long it was! how long it was! Everything was dark, silent,\\r\\nmotionless, not a breath of air and not a star, but heavy banks of\\r\\nclouds which one could not see, but which weighed, oh! so heavily on my\\r\\nsoul.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at my house and waited. How long it was! I already began to\\r\\nthink that the fire had gone out of its own accord, or that he had\\r\\nextinguished it, when one of the lower windows gave way under the\\r\\nviolence of the flames, and a long, soft, caressing sheet of red flame\\r\\nmounted up the white wall, and kissed it as high as the roof. The light\\r\\nfell onto the trees, the branches, and the leaves, and a shiver of fear\\r\\npervaded them also! The birds awoke; a dog began to howl, and it seemed\\r\\nto me as if the day were breaking! Almost immediately two other windows\\r\\nflew into fragments, and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my\\r\\nhouse was nothing but a terrible furnace. But a cry, a horrible, shrill,\\r\\nheartrending cry, a woman\\'s cry, sounded through the night, and two\\r\\ngarret windows were opened! I had forgotten the servants! I saw the\\r\\nterror-struck faces, and their frantically waving arms!...\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, overwhelmed with horror, I set off to run to the village,\\r\\nshouting: \"Help! help! fire! fire!\" I met some people who were already\\r\\ncoming onto the scene, and I went back with them to see!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the house was nothing but a horrible and a magnificent\\r\\nfuneral pile, a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country, a\\r\\nfuneral pile where men were burning, and where he was burning also, He,\\r\\nHe, my prisoner, that new Being, the new master, the Horla!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls, and a volcano of\\r\\nflames darted up to the sky. Through all the windows which opened onto\\r\\nthat furnace, I saw the flames darting, and I thought that he was there,\\r\\nin that kiln, dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead? perhaps?... His body? Was not his body, which was transparent,\\r\\nindestructible by such means as would kill ours?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he was not dead?... Perhaps time alone has power over that Invisible\\r\\nand Redoubtable Being. Why this transparent, unrecognizable body, this\\r\\nbody belonging to a spirit, if it also had to fear ills, infirmities and\\r\\npremature destruction?\\r\\n\\r\\nPremature destruction? All human terror springs from that! After man the\\r\\nHorla. After him who can die every day, at any hour, at any moment, by\\r\\nany accident, he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and\\r\\nminute, because he had touched the limits of his existence!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo ... no ... without any doubt ... he is not dead.... Then ... then ...\\r\\nI suppose I must kill myself!...',\n"," 'LOVE\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE PAGES FROM A SPORTSMAN\\'S BOOK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just read among the General News in one of the papers, a drama of\\r\\npassion. He killed her and then he killed himself, so he must have loved\\r\\nher. What matter He or She? Their love alone matters to me; and it does\\r\\nnot interest me because it moves me or astonishes me, or because it\\r\\nsoftens me or makes me think, but because it recalls to my mind a\\r\\nremembrance of my youth, a strange recollection of a hunting adventure\\r\\nwhere Love appeared to me, as the Cross appeared to the early\\r\\nChristians, in the midst of the heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born with all the instincts and the senses of primitive man,\\r\\ntempered by the arguments and the feelings of a civilized being. I am\\r\\npassionately fond of shooting, and the sight of the bleeding animal,\\r\\nwith the blood on its feathers and on my hands, affect my heart so, as\\r\\nalmost to make it stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year the cold weather set in suddenly towards the end of autumn,\\r\\nand I was invited by one of my cousins, Karl de Rauville, to go with him\\r\\nand shoot ducks on the marshes, at daybreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who was a jolly fellow of forty, with red hair, very stout\\r\\nand bearded, a country gentleman, an amiable semi-brute, of a happy\\r\\ndisposition and endowed with that Gallic wit which makes even mediocrity\\r\\nagreeable, lived in a house, half farmhouse, half château, situated in\\r\\na broad valley through which a river ran. The hills right and left were\\r\\ncovered with woods, old seignorial woods where magnificent trees still\\r\\nremained, and where the rarest feathered game in that part of France was\\r\\nto be found. Eagles were shot there occasionally, and birds of passage,\\r\\nthose which rarely come into our over-populated part of the country,\\r\\nalmost infallibly stopped amid these branches, which were centuries old,\\r\\nas if they knew or recognized a little corner of a forest of ancient\\r\\ntimes which had remained there to serve them as a shelter during their\\r\\nshort nocturnal halting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the valley there were large meadows watered by trenches and separated\\r\\nby hedges; then, further on the river, which up to that point had been\\r\\ncanalized, expanded into a vast marsh. That marsh, which was the best\\r\\nshooting ground which I ever saw, was my cousin\\'s chief care, who kept\\r\\nit like a park. Among the number of rushes that covered it, and made it\\r\\nliving, rustling and rough, narrow passages had been made, through which\\r\\nthe flat-bottomed boats, which were impelled and steered by poles,\\r\\npassed along silently over the dead water, brushed up against the reeds\\r\\nand made the swift fish take refuge among the weeds, and the wild fowl\\r\\ndive, whose pointed, black heads disappeared suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am passionately fond of the water; the sea, although it is too vast,\\r\\ntoo full of movement, impossible to hold, the rivers, which are so\\r\\nbeautiful, but which pass on, flee away and go, and above all the\\r\\nmarshes, where the whole unknown existence of aquatic animals\\r\\npalpitates. The marsh is an entire world to itself on earth, a different\\r\\nworld which has its own life, its settled inhabitants and its passing\\r\\ntravelers, its voices, its noises, and above all its mystery. Nothing is\\r\\nmore disturbing, nothing, more disquieting, more terrifying\\r\\noccasionally, than a fen. Why should this terror hang over these low\\r\\nplains covered with water? Is it the vague rustling of the rushes, the\\r\\nstrange Will-o\\'-the-wisps, the profound silence which envelops them on\\r\\ncalm nights, or is it the strange mists, which hang over the rushes like\\r\\na shroud; or else it is the imperceptible splashing, so slight and so\\r\\ngentle, and sometimes more terrifying than the cannons of men or the\\r\\nthunders of skies, which make these marshes resemble countries which\\r\\nnone has dreamed of, terrible countries concealing an unknown and\\r\\ndangerous secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, something else belongs to it, another mystery, more profound and\\r\\ngraver floats amid these thick mists, perhaps the mystery of the\\r\\ncreation itself! For was it not in stagnant and muddy water, amid the\\r\\nheavy humidity of moist land under the heat of the sun, that the first\\r\\ngerm of life vibrated and expanded to the day?\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived at my cousin\\'s in the evening. It was freezing hard enough to\\r\\nsplit stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, in the large room whose sideboards, walls and ceilings\\r\\nwere covered with stuffed birds, with extended wings or perched on\\r\\nbranches to which they were nailed, hawks, herons, owls, nightjars,\\r\\nbuzzards, tiercels, vultures, falcons, my cousin, who himself resembled\\r\\nsome strange animal from a cold country, dressed in a sealskin jacket,\\r\\ntold me what preparations he had made for that same night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to start at half past three in the morning, so as to arrive at\\r\\nthe place which he had chosen for our watching place at about half past\\r\\nfour. On that spot a hut had been built of lumps of ice, so as to\\r\\nshelter us somewhat from the terrible wind which precedes daybreak, that\\r\\nwind which is so cold that it tears the flesh as if with a saw, cuts it\\r\\nlike the blade of a knife and pricks it like a poisoned sting, twists it\\r\\nlike a pair of pincers, and burns it like fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin rubbed his hands: \"I have never known such a frost,\" he said;\\r\\n\"it is already twelve degrees below zero at six o\\'clock in the evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI threw myself onto my bed immediately after we had finished our meal,\\r\\nand I went to sleep by the light of a bright fire burning in the grate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o\\'clock he woke me. In my turn, I put on a sheepskin, and I\\r\\nfound my cousin Karl covered with a bearskin. After having each of us\\r\\nswallowed two cups of scalding coffee, followed by glasses of liqueur\\r\\nbrandy, we started, accompanied by a gamekeeper and our dogs, Plongeon\\r\\nand Pierrot.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first moment that I got outside, I felt chilled to the very\\r\\nmarrow. It was one of those nights on which the earth seems dead with\\r\\ncold. The frozen air becomes resisting and palpable, such pain does it\\r\\ncause; no breath of wind moves it, it is fixed and motionless; it bites,\\r\\npierces through you, dries, kills the trees, the plants, the insects,\\r\\nthe small birds themselves that fall from the branches onto the hard\\r\\nground, and become hard themselves under the grip of the cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon, which was in her last quarter and was inclining all to one\\r\\nside, seemed fainting in the midst of space, and so weak that she did\\r\\nnot seem able to take her departure, and so she remained up yonder, also\\r\\nseized and paralyzed by the severity of the weather. She shed a\\r\\ncold, mournful light over the world, that dying and wan light which she\\r\\ngives us every month, at the end of her resurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl and I went side by side, our backs bent, our hands in our pockets\\r\\nand our guns under our arms. Our boots, which were wrapped in wool, so\\r\\nthat we might be able to walk without slipping on the frozen river, made\\r\\nno sound, and I looked at the white vapor which our dogs\\' breath made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon on the edge of the marsh, and we went into one of these\\r\\nlanes of dry rushes which ran through this low forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur elbows, which touched the long, ribbonlike leaves, left a slight\\r\\nnoise behind us, and I was seized, as I had never been before, by the\\r\\npowerful singular emotion which marshes cause in me. This one was dead,\\r\\ndead from cold, since we were walking on it, in the middle of its\\r\\npopulation of dried rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, at the turn of one of the lanes, I perceived the ice-hut which\\r\\nhad been constructed to shelter us. I went in, and as we had nearly an\\r\\nhour to wait before the wandering birds would awake, I rolled myself up\\r\\nin my rug in order to try and get warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, lying on my back, I began to look at the misshapen moon, which had\\r\\nfour horns, through the vaguely transparent walls of this polar house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the frost of the frozen marshes, the cold of these walls, the cold\\r\\nfrom the firmament penetrated me so terribly, that I began to cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin Karl became uneasy. \"So much the worse if we do not kill much\\r\\nto-day,\" he said, \"I do not want you to catch cold; we will light a\\r\\nfire.\" And he told the gamekeeper to cut some rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made a pile in the middle of our hut, which had a hole in the middle\\r\\nof the roof to let out the smoke, and when the red flames rose up to the\\r\\nclear, crystal cloisons they began to melt, gently, imperceptibly, as if\\r\\nthese stones of ice had sweated. Karl, who had remained outside, called\\r\\nout to me: \"Come and look here!\" I went out of the hut and remained,\\r\\nstruck with astonishment. Our hut, in the shape of a cone, looked like\\r\\nan enormous diamond with a heart of fire, which had been suddenly\\r\\nplanted there in the midst of the frozen water of the marsh. And inside\\r\\nwe saw two fantastic forms, those of our dogs, who were warming\\r\\nthemselves at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a peculiar cry, a lost, a wandering cry, passed over our heads, and\\r\\nthe light from our hearth showed us the wild birds. Nothing moves one so\\r\\nmuch as the first clamor of life which one does not see, and which is\\r\\npassing through the somber air so quickly and so far off, before the\\r\\nfirst streak of the winter\\'s day appears on the horizon. It seems to me\\r\\nat this glacial hour of dawn, as if that passing cry which is carried\\r\\naway by the wings of a bird, is the sigh of a soul from the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put out the fire,\" Karl said. \"It is getting daylight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was, in fact, beginning to grow pale, and the flights of ducks\\r\\nmade long, rapid spots, which were soon obliterated, on the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stream of light burst out into the night; Karl had fired, and the two\\r\\ndogs ran forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, nearly every minute, now he, now I, aimed rapidly as soon as\\r\\nthe shadow of a flying flock appeared above the rushes. And Pierrot and\\r\\nPlongeon, out of breath but happy, retrieved the bleeding birds for us,\\r\\nwhose eyes still, occasionally, looked at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had risen, and it was a bright day with a blue sky, and we were\\r\\nthinking of taking our departure, when two birds with extended necks and\\r\\noutstretched wings, glided rapidly over our heads. I fired, and one of\\r\\nthem fell almost at my feet. It was a teal, with a silver breast, and\\r\\nthen, in the blue space above me, I heard a voice, the voice of a bird.\\r\\nIt was a short, repeated, heartrending lament; and the bird, the little\\r\\nanimal that had been spared began to turn round in the blue sky, over\\r\\nour heads, looking at its dead companion which I was holding in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl was on his knees, his gun to his shoulder watching it eagerly,\\r\\nuntil it should be within shot. \"You have killed the duck,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and the drake will not fly away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly did not fly away; he turned round over our heads\\r\\ncontinually, and continued his cries. Never have any groans of suffering\\r\\npained me so much as that desolate appeal, as that lamentable reproach\\r\\nof this poor bird which was lost in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally he took a flight under the menace of the gun which followed\\r\\nhis flight, and seemed ready to continue his flight alone, but as he\\r\\ncould not make up his mind to this, he soon returned to find his mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave her on the ground,\" Karl said to me, \"he will come within shot by\\r\\nand by.\" And he did indeed come near us, careless of danger, infatuated\\r\\nby his animals\\' love, by his affection for that other animal which I had\\r\\njust killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl fired, and it was as if somebody had cut the string which held the\\r\\nbird suspended. I saw something black descend, and I heard the noise of\\r\\na fall among the rushes. And Pierrot brought it to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put them--they were already cold--into the same bag, and I returned to\\r\\nParis the same evening.',\n"," 'THE HOLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCUTS AND WOUNDS WHICH CAUSED DEATH. That was the heading of the charge\\r\\nwhich brought Leopold Renard, upholsterer, before the Assize Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flamèche, widow of the\\r\\nvictim, and Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent, plumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, a little ugly woman,\\r\\nwho looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how Renard (Leopold) recounted the drama:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens, it is a misfortune of which I was the first victim all\\r\\nthe time, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts are their\\r\\nown commentary, Monsieur le Président. I am an honest man, a hard\\r\\nworking man, an upholsterer in the same street for the last sixteen\\r\\nyears, known, liked, respected and esteemed by all, as my neighbors have\\r\\ntestified, even the porter who is not _folâtre_ every day. I am fond of\\r\\nwork, I am fond of saving, I like honest men, and respectable pleasures.\\r\\nThat is what has ruined me, so much the worse for me; but as my will had\\r\\nnothing to do with it, I continue to respect myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every Sunday for the last five years, my wife and I have been to spend\\r\\nthe day at Passy. We get fresh air, without counting that we are fond of\\r\\nfishing. Oh! we are as fond of it as we are of small onions. Mélie\\r\\ninspired me with that passion, the jade, and she is more enthusiastic\\r\\nthan I am, the scold, seeing that all the mischief in this business is\\r\\nher fault, as you will see immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am strong and mild-tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in me.\\r\\nBut she! oh! la! la! she looks like nothing, she is short and thin; very\\r\\nwell, she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny that she has\\r\\nsome good qualities; she has some, and very important ones for a man in\\r\\nbusiness. But her character! Just ask about it in the neighborhood, and\\r\\neven the porter\\'s wife, who has just sent me about my business ... she\\r\\nwill tell you something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day she used to find fault with my mild temper: \\'I would not put\\r\\nup with this! I would not put up with that.\\' If I had listened to her,\\r\\nMonsieur le Président, I should have had at least three bouts of\\r\\nfisticuffs a month....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Renard interrupted him: \"And for good reasons too; they laugh\\r\\nbest who laugh last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned towards her frankly: \"Oh! very well, I can charge you, since\\r\\nyou were the cause of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, facing the President again he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening, so as\\r\\nto be able to begin fishing at daybreak the next morning. It is a habit\\r\\nwhich has become a second nature with us, as the saying is. Three years\\r\\nago this summer I discovered a place, oh! such a spot! Oh! there! in the\\r\\nshade, eight feet of water at least and perhaps ten, a hole with\\r\\n_retour_ under the bank, a regular nest for fish and a paradise for the\\r\\nfisherman. I might look upon that hole as my property, Monsieur le\\r\\nPrésident, as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the\\r\\nneighborhood knew it, without making any opposition. They used to say:\\r\\n\\'That is Renard\\'s place;\\' and nobody would have gone to it, not even\\r\\nMonsieur Plumsay, who is well known, be it said without any offense, for\\r\\nboning other peoples\\' places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I returned to my place of which I felt certain, just as if I had\\r\\nowned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when I got into\\r\\n_Delila_, with my wife. _Delila_ is my Norwegian boat, which I had built\\r\\nby Fourmaise, and which is light and safe. Well, as I said, we got into\\r\\nthe boat and we were going to bait, and for baiting, there is nobody to\\r\\nbe compared with me, and they all know it. You want to know with what I\\r\\nbait? I cannot answer that question; it has nothing to do with the\\r\\naccident; I cannot answer, that is my secret. There are more than three\\r\\nhundred people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy\\r\\nand liquors, fried fish, matelotes,[16] to make me tell! But just go and\\r\\ntry whether the chub will come. Ah! they have patted my stomach to get\\r\\nat my secret, my recipe.... Only my wife knows ... and she will not tell\\r\\nit, any more than I shall!... Is not that so Mélie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the Court interrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just get to the facts as soon as you can,\" and the accused continued:\\r\\n\"I am getting to them; I am getting to them. Well, on Saturday July 8,\\r\\nwe left by the twenty-five past five train, and before dinner we went to\\r\\nground-bait as usual. The weather promised to keep fine, and I said to\\r\\nMélie: \\'All right for to-morrow!\\' And she replied: \\'It looks like it.\\'\\r\\nWe never talk more than that together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and that was\\r\\nthe cause of everything. I said to Mélie: \\'Look here Mélie, it is fine\\r\\nweather, so suppose I drink a bottle of _Casque à mèche_.\\' That is a\\r\\nlittle white wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too\\r\\nmuch of it it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a\\r\\nnightcap. Do you understand me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She replied: \\'You can do as you please, but you will be ill again, and\\r\\nI will not be able to get up to-morrow.\\' That was true, sensible and\\r\\nprudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless, I could not\\r\\nwithstand it, and I drank my bottle. It all comes from that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! It kept me awake till two o\\'clock in\\r\\nthe morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have\\r\\nheard the angel shouting at the last Judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In short, my wife woke me at six o\\'clock, and I jumped out of bed,\\r\\nhastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on\\r\\nboard _Delila_. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it\\r\\nwas already taken! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years,\\r\\nand it made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said\\r\\nto myself, \\'Confound it all! confound it!\\' And then my wife began to nag\\r\\nat me. \\'Eh! What about your _Casque à mèche_! Get along, you drunkard!\\r\\nAre you satisfied, you great fool?\\' I could say nothing, because it was\\r\\nall quite true, and so I landed all the same near the spot and tried to\\r\\nprofit by what was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch\\r\\nnothing, and go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a little thin man, in white linen coat and waistcoat, and with a\\r\\nlarge straw hat, and his wife, a fat woman who was doing embroidery, was\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When she saw us take up our position close to their place, she\\r\\nmurmured: \\'I suppose there are no other places on the river!\\' And my\\r\\nwife, who was furious, replied: \\'People who know how to behave, make\\r\\ninquiries about the habits of the neighborhood before occupying reserved\\r\\nspots.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did not want a fuss, I said to her: \\'Hold your tongue, Mélie. Let\\r\\nthem go on, let them go on; we shall see.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we had fastened _Delila_ under the willow trees, and had landed\\r\\nand were fishing side by side, Mélie and I, close to the two others; but\\r\\nhere, Monsieur, I must enter into details.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had only been there about five minutes when our male neighbor\\'s\\r\\nfloat began to go down two or three times, and then he pulled out a chub\\r\\nas thick as my thigh, rather less, perhaps, but nearly as big! My heart\\r\\nbeat, and the perspiration stood on my forehead, and Mélie said to me:\\r\\n\\'Well, you sot, did you see that?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then, Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who is fond of gudgeon\\r\\nfishing, passed in a boat, and called out to me; \\'So somebody has taken\\r\\nyour usual place, Monsieur Renard?\\' And I replied: \\'Yes, Monsieur Bru,\\r\\nthere are some people in this world who do not know the usages of common\\r\\npoliteness.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little man in linen pretended not to hear, nor his fat lump of a\\r\\nwife, either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the President interrupted him a second time: \"Take care, you are\\r\\ninsulting the widow, Madame Flamèche, who is present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard made his excuses: \"I beg your pardon, I beg pardon, my anger\\r\\ncarried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had passed when the\\r\\nlittle man caught another chub and another almost immediately, and\\r\\nanother five minutes later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The tears were in my eyes, and then I knew that Madame Renard was\\r\\nboiling with rage, for she kept on nagging at me: \\'Oh! how horrid! Don\\'t\\r\\nyou see that he is robbing you of your fish? Do you think that you will\\r\\ncatch anything? Not even a frog, nothing whatever. Why my hands are\\r\\nburning, just to think of it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I said to myself: \\'Let us wait until twelve o\\'clock. Then this\\r\\npoaching fellow will go to lunch, and I shall get my place again.\\' As\\r\\nfor me, Monsieur le Président, I lunch on the spot every Sunday; we\\r\\nbring our provisions in _Delila_. But there! At twelve o\\'clock, the\\r\\nwretch produced a fowl out of a newspaper, and while he was eating,\\r\\nactually he caught another chub!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélie and I had a morsel also, just a thumb-piece, a mere nothing, for\\r\\nour heart was not in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I took up my newspaper, to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I read\\r\\nthe _Gil Blas_ in the shade like that, by the side of the water. It is\\r\\nColumbine\\'s day, you know, Columbine who writes the articles in the _Gil\\r\\nBlas_. I generally put Madame Renard into a passion by pretending to\\r\\nknow this Columbine. It is not true, for I do not know her, and have\\r\\nnever seen her, but that does not matter; she writes very well, and\\r\\nthen she says things straight out for a woman. She suits me, and there\\r\\nare not many of her sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately, and very\\r\\nangry, and so I held my tongue, and at that moment our two witnesses who\\r\\nare present here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur Durdent appeared on the\\r\\nother side of the river. We knew each other by sight. The little man\\r\\nbegan to fish again, and he caught so many that I trembled with\\r\\nvexation, and his wife said: \\'It is an uncommonly good spot, and we will\\r\\ncome here always Desiré.\\' As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and\\r\\nMadame Renard kept repeating: \\'You are not a man; you have the blood of\\r\\na chicken in your veins;\\' and suddenly I said to her: \\'Look here, I\\r\\nwould rather go away, or I shall only be doing something foolish.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she whispered to me as if she had put a red-hot iron under my nose:\\r\\n\\'You are not a man. Now you are going to run away, and surrender your\\r\\nplace! Off you go, Bazaine!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I felt that, but yet I did not move, while the other fellow\\r\\npulled out a bream, oh! I never saw such a large one before, never! And\\r\\nthen my wife began to talk aloud, as if she were thinking, and you can\\r\\nsee her trickery. She said: \\'That is what one might call stolen fish,\\r\\nseeing that we baited the place ourselves. At any rate, they ought to\\r\\ngive us back the money we have spent on bait.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the fat woman in the cotton dress said in turn: \\'Do you mean to\\r\\ncall us thieves, Madame?\\' And they began to explain, and then they came\\r\\nto words. Oh! Lord! those creatures know some good ones. They shouted\\r\\nso loud, that our two witnesses, who were on the other bank, began to\\r\\ncall out by way of a joke: \\'Less noise over there; you will prevent your\\r\\nhusbands from fishing.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is that neither of us moved any more than if we had been two\\r\\ntree-stumps. We remained there, with our noses over the water, as if we\\r\\nhad heard nothing, but by Jove, we heard all the same. \\'You are a mere\\r\\nliar.--You are nothing better than a streetwalker.--You are only a\\r\\ntrollop.--You are a regular strumpet.\\' And so on, and so on; a sailor\\r\\ncould not have said more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, and turned round. It was the other\\r\\none, the fat woman, who had fallen onto my wife with her parasol.\\r\\n_Whack! whack_! Mélie got two of them, but she was furious, and she hits\\r\\nhard when she is in a rage, so she caught the fat woman by the hair and\\r\\nthen, _thump, thump_, and slaps in the face rained down like ripe plums.\\r\\nI should have let them go on; women among themselves; men among\\r\\nthemselves; it does not do to mix the blows, but the little man in the\\r\\nlinen jacket jumped up like a devil and was going to rush at my wife.\\r\\nAh! no, no, not that my friend! I caught the gentleman with the end of\\r\\nmy fist, and _crash, crash_, one on the nose, the other in the stomach.\\r\\nHe threw up his arms and legs and fell on his back into the river, just\\r\\ninto the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le Président, if\\r\\nI had had the time. But unfortunately the fat woman got the better of\\r\\nit, and she was drubbing Mélie terribly. I know that I ought not to have\\r\\nassisted her while the man was drinking his fill, but I never thought\\r\\nthat he would drown, and said to myself: \\'Bah, it will cool him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I therefore ran up to the women to separate them, and all I received\\r\\nwas scratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures! Well, it took me\\r\\nfive minutes, and perhaps ten to separate those two viragoes, and when I\\r\\nturned round, there was nothing more to be seen, and the water was as\\r\\nsmooth as a lake, while the others yonder kept shouting: \\'Fish him out!\\'\\r\\nand though it was all very well to say that, I cannot swim and still\\r\\nless dive!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At last the man from the dam came, and two gentlemen with boat hooks,\\r\\nbut it had taken over a quarter of an hour. He was found at the bottom\\r\\nof the hole in eight feet of water, as I have said, but he had got it,\\r\\nthe poor little man in his linen suit! There are the facts, such as I\\r\\nhave sworn to. I am innocent, on my honor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe witnesses having deposed to the same effect, the accused was\\r\\nacquitted.',\n"," 'SAVED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marquise de Rennedon came rushing in like a ball smashing a\\r\\nwindow, and she began to laugh before she spoke, to laugh until she\\r\\ncried, like she had done a month previously, when she had told her\\r\\nfriend that she had betrayed the marquis in order to have her revenge,\\r\\nand only once, because he was really too stupid and too jealous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness de Grangerie had thrown the book which she was\\r\\nreading on the sofa, and looked at Annette curiously. She was already\\r\\nlaughing herself, and at last she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you been doing now?\" \"Oh! ... my dear!... my dear! it is too\\r\\nfunny ... too funny.... Just fancy ...

It cost Jacques\\r\\nfifteen louis, the price of an evening, from seven o\\'clock until\\r\\nmidnight, including a dinner, at three louis an hour, and he obtained\\r\\nthe photograph into the bargain.\" \"It appears to me that he might have\\r\\nobtained it anyhow by means of some artifice and without ... without ...\\r\\nwithout being obliged to take the original at the same time.\" \"Oh! she\\r\\nis pretty, and Jacques did not mind the least. And then, I wanted some\\r\\ndetails about her, physical details about her figure, her breast, her\\r\\ncomplexion, a thousand things, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not understand you.\" \"You shall see. When I had learned all that I\\r\\nwanted to know, I went to a ... how shall I put it ... to a man of\\r\\nbusiness ... you know ... one of those men who transact business of all\\r\\nsorts ... agents of ... of ... of publicity and complicity ... one of\\r\\nthose men ... well, you understand what I mean.\" \"Pretty nearly, I\\r\\nthink. And what did you say to him?\" \"I said to him, showing the\\r\\nphotograph of Clarisse (her name is Clarisse): \\'Monsieur, I want a\\r\\nlady\\'s maid who resembles this photograph. I require one who is pretty,\\r\\nelegant, neat and sharp. I will pay her whatever is necessary, and if it\\r\\ncosts me ten thousand francs so much the worse. I shall not require her\\r\\nfor more than three months.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man looked extremely astonished, and said: \\'Do you require a maid\\r\\nof an irreproachable character, Madame?\\' I blushed, and stammered. \\'Yes,\\r\\nof course, for honesty.\\' He continued: ... \\'And ... then ... as regards\\r\\nmorals....\\' I did not venture to reply, so I only made a sign with my\\r\\nhead, which signified: _no_. Then suddenly, I comprehended that he had a\\r\\nhorrible suspicion and losing my presence of mind, I exclaimed: \\'Oh,\\r\\nMonsieur, ... it is for my husband, in order that I may surprise\\r\\nhim....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the man began to laugh, and from his looks I gathered that I had\\r\\nregained his esteem. He even thought I was brave, and I would willingly\\r\\nhave made a bet that at that moment he was longing to shake hands with\\r\\nme. However, he said to me: \\'In a week, Madame, I shall have what you\\r\\nrequire; I will answer for my success, and you shall not pay me until I\\r\\nhave succeeded. So this is a photograph of your husband\\'s mistress?\\'\\r\\n\\'Yes, Monsieur,\\' \\'A handsome woman, and not too stout. And what scent?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not understand, and repeated: \\'What scent?\\' He smiled: \\'Yes,\\r\\nMadame, the perfume is essential to seduce a man, for it unconsciously\\r\\nbrings to his mind certain reminiscences which dispose him to action;\\r\\nthe perfume creates an obscure confusion in his mind, and disturbs and\\r\\nenervates him by recalling his pleasures to him. You must also try to\\r\\nfind out what your husband is in the habit of eating when he dines with\\r\\nhis lady, and you might give him the same dishes the day you catch him.\\r\\nOh! we have got him, Madame, we have got him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went away delighted, for here I had lighted on a very intelligent\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three days later, I saw a tall, dark girl arrive at my house; she was\\r\\nvery handsome and her looks were modest and bold at the same time, the\\r\\npeculiar look of a female rake. She behaved very properly towards me,\\r\\nand as I did not exactly know what she was, I called her _Mademoiselle_,\\r\\nbut she said immediately: \\'Oh! pray, Madame, only call me Rose.\\' And she\\r\\nbegan to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, Rose, you know why you have come here?\\' \\'I can guess it,\\r\\nMadame.\\' \\'Very good, my girl ... and that will not ... be too much\\r\\nbother for you?\\' \\'Oh! madame, this will be the eighth divorce that I\\r\\nshall have caused; I am used to it.\\' \\'Why, that is capital. Will it take\\r\\nyou long to succeed?\\' \\'Oh! Madame, that depends entirely on Monsieur\\'s\\r\\ntemperament. When I have seen Monsieur for five minutes alone I shall\\r\\nbe able to tell you exactly.\\' \\'You will see him soon, my child, but I\\r\\nmust tell you that he is not handsome.\\' \\'That does not matter to me,\\r\\nMadame. I have already separated some very ugly ones. But I must ask\\r\\nyou, Madame, whether you have discovered his favorite perfume?\\' \\'Yes,\\r\\nRose,--verbena.\\' \\'So much the better, Madame, for I am also very fond of\\r\\nthat scent! Can you also tell me, Madame, whether Monsieur\\'s mistress\\r\\nwears silk underclothing and nightdresses?\\' \\'No, my child, cambric and\\r\\nlace.\\' \\'Oh! then she is altogether of superior station, for silk\\r\\nunderclothing is getting quite common.\\' \\'What you say is quite true!\\'\\r\\n\\'Well, Madame, I will enter your service.\\' And so, as a matter of fact,\\r\\nshe did immediately, and as if she had done nothing else all her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An hour later my husband came home. Rose did not even raise her eyes to\\r\\nhim, but he raised his eyes to her. She already smelt strongly of\\r\\nverbena, and in five minutes she left the room, and he immediately asked\\r\\nme: \\'Who is that girl?\\' \\'Why ... my new lady\\'s maid.\\' \\'Where did you\\r\\npick her up?\\' \\'Baroness de Grangerie got her for me with the best\\r\\nreferences.\\' \\'Ah! she is rather pretty!\\' \\'Do you think so?\\' \\'Why, yes\\r\\n... for a lady\\'s maid.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was delighted, for I felt that he was already biting, and that same\\r\\nevening Rose said to me: \\'I can now promise you that it will not take\\r\\nmore than a fortnight. Monsieur is very easily caught!\\' \\'Ah! you have\\r\\ntried already?\\' \\'No, Madame, he only asked what my name was ... so that\\r\\nhe might hear what my voice was like.\\' \\'Very well, my dear Rose. Get on\\r\\nas quick as you can.\\' \\'Do not be alarmed, Madame; I shall only resist\\r\\nlong enough not to make myself depreciated.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of a week my husband scarcely ever went out; I saw him\\r\\nroaming about the house the whole afternoon, and what was most\\r\\nsignificant in the matter was, that he no longer prevented me from going\\r\\nout. And I, I was out of doors nearly the whole day long, ... in order\\r\\n... in order to leave him at liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the ninth day, while Rose was undressing me, she said to me with a\\r\\ntimid air: \\'It happened this morning, Madame.\\' I was rather surprised,\\r\\nor rather overcome even, not at the part itself, but at the way in which\\r\\nshe told me, and I stammered out: \\'And ... and ... it went off well?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! yes, very well, Madame. For the last three days he has been\\r\\npressing me, but I did not wish matters to proceed too quickly. You will\\r\\ntell me when you want us to be caught, Madame.\\' \\'Yes, certainly.\\r\\nHere!... let us say Thursday.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, I shall grant nothing\\r\\nmore until then, so as to keep Monsieur on the alert.\\' \\'You are sure not\\r\\nto fail?\\' \\'Oh! quite sure, Madame. I will excite him, so as to make him\\r\\nbe there at the very moment which you may appoint.\\' \\'Let us say five\\r\\no\\'clock, then.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, and where?\\' \\'Well ... in my\\r\\nbedroom.\\' \\'Very good, Madame, in your bedroom.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will understand what I did then, my dear. I went and fetched Mamma\\r\\nand Papa first of all, and then my uncle d\\'Orvelin, the President, and\\r\\nMonsieur Raplet, the Judge, my husband\\'s friend. I had not told them\\r\\nwhat I was going to show them, but I made them all go on tiptoe as far\\r\\nas the door of my room. I waited until five o\\'clock exactly, and oh! how\\r\\nmy heart beat! I had made the porter come upstairs as well, so as to\\r\\nhave an additional witness! And then ... and then at the moment when the\\r\\nclock began to strike, I opened the door wide.... Ah! ah! ah! Here he\\r\\nwas evidently, ... it was quite evident, my dear.... Oh! what a face!...\\r\\nif you had only seen his face!... And he turned round, the idiot! Oh!\\r\\nhow funny he looked.... I laughed, I laughed.... And papa was angry and\\r\\nwanted to give my husband a beating.... And the porter, a good servant,\\r\\nhelped him to dress himself ... before us ... before us.... He buttoned\\r\\nhis braces for him ... what a joke it was!... As for Rose, she was\\r\\nperfect, absolutely perfect.... She cried ... oh! she cried very well.\\r\\nShe is an invaluable girl.... If you ever want her, don\\'t forget!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here I am.... I came immediately to tell you of the affair ...\\r\\ndirectly. I am free. Long live divorce!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she began to dance in the middle of the drawing-room, while the\\r\\nlittle baroness, who was thoughtful and vexed, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you not invite me to see it?\"',\n"," 'BELLFLOWER[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow strange those old recollections are which haunt us, without our\\r\\nbeing able to get rid of them!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so\\r\\nvividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many\\r\\nsinister things, which were either affecting or terrible, that I am\\r\\nastonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of\\r\\nMother Bellflower recurring to my mind\\'s eye, just as I knew her\\r\\nformerly, now so long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old seamstress, who came to my parents house once a week,\\r\\nevery Thursday to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those\\r\\ncountry houses called _châteaux_, and which are merely old houses with\\r\\npointed roofs, which are surrounded by three or four farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few\\r\\nhundred yards off, and lay closely round the church, a red brick church,\\r\\nwhich had become black with age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and\\r\\nseven in the morning, and went immediately into the linen-room and began\\r\\nto work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she\\r\\nhad a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard,\\r\\ngrowing in tufts, in curly bunches, which looked as if they had been\\r\\nsown by a madman over that great face of a gendarme in petticoats. She\\r\\nhad them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on\\r\\nher cheeks; and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long,\\r\\nand quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of\\r\\nmoustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe limped, but not like lame people generally do, but like a ship at\\r\\nanchor. When she planted her great, bony, swerving body on her sound\\r\\nleg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then\\r\\nsuddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss, and buried herself\\r\\nin the ground. Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she balanced herself\\r\\nat the same time, and her head, which was always covered with an\\r\\nenormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to\\r\\ntraverse the horizon from North to South and from South to North, at\\r\\neach of her movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I went into the\\r\\nlinen-room, where I found her installed at work, with a foot-warmer\\r\\nunder her feet. As soon as I arrived, she made me take the foot-warmer\\r\\nand sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large, chilly\\r\\nroom under the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told me stories, while mending the linen with her long crooked\\r\\nnimble fingers; her eyes behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had\\r\\nimpaired her sight, appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, as far as I can remember, the things which she told me and by\\r\\nwhich my childish heart was moved, the large heart of a poor woman. She\\r\\ntold me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the\\r\\ncowhouse and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet\\'s\\r\\nmill, looking at the sails turning, or about a hen\\'s egg, which had\\r\\nbeen found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand\\r\\nwhat creature had been there to lay it, or the story of Jean-Jean Pila\\'s\\r\\ndog, who had been ten leagues to bring back his master\\'s breeches, which\\r\\na tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors, after\\r\\nhe had been in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a\\r\\nmanner, that in my mind they assumed the proportions of\\r\\nnever-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the\\r\\ningenious stories invented by the poets which my mother told me in the\\r\\nevening had none of the flavor, none of the fullness nor of the vigor of\\r\\nthe peasant woman\\'s narratives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, one Thursday, when I had spent all the morning in listening to\\r\\nMother Clochette, I wanted to go up stairs to her again during the day\\r\\nafter picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm.\\r\\nI remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress lying on\\r\\nthe ground by the side of her chair, with her face to the ground and her\\r\\narms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of\\r\\nmy shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer\\r\\none, no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles\\r\\nglistened against the wall, as they had rolled away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few\\r\\nminutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred\\r\\nmy childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing-room and went\\r\\nand hid myself in a dark corner, in the depths of a great, old armchair,\\r\\nwhere I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time no doubt, for\\r\\nnight came on. Suddenly somebody came in with a lamp, without seeing me,\\r\\nhowever, and I heard my father and mother talking with the medical man,\\r\\nwhose voice I recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the causes of\\r\\nthe accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down\\r\\nand had a glass of liquor and biscuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my\\r\\nmind until I die! I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"the poor woman! She broke her leg the day of my arrival\\r\\nhere, and I had only not even had time to wash my hands after getting\\r\\noff the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad\\r\\ncase, very bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would any one\\r\\nbelieve it? I have never told her story before, and nobody except myself\\r\\nand one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the\\r\\ncountry, ever knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be less discreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then a young assistant teacher came to live in the village; he was\\r\\ngood-looking and had the bearing of a sub-officer. All the girls ran\\r\\nafter him, and he acted the disdainful, and besides that, he was very\\r\\nmuch afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who\\r\\noccasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here, and\\r\\nwho was afterwards nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled\\r\\nout the pretty young girl, who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by\\r\\nthis impregnable conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and\\r\\nhe succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the\\r\\nhay-loft behind the school, at night, after she had done her day\\'s\\r\\nsewing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left\\r\\nthe Grabu\\'s, she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to wait for her\\r\\nlover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to\\r\\nher, when the door of the hay-loft opened and the schoolmaster appeared,\\r\\nand asked: \\'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?\\' Feeling sure that\\r\\nhe would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and\\r\\nreplied stupidly: \\'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of\\r\\nhay, Monsieur Grabu.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark, and Sigisbert pushed the\\r\\nfrightened girl to the further end and said: \\'Go there and hide\\r\\nyourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: \\'Why, you are\\r\\nnot by yourself?\\' \\'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!\\' \\'But you are not, for you\\r\\nare talking.\\' \\'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.\\' \\'I will soon find out,\\'\\r\\nthe old man replied, and double-locking the door, he went down to get a\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one frequently meets, lost\\r\\nhis head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: \\'Hide\\r\\nyourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread\\r\\nfor my whole life; you will ruin my whole career.... Do hide yourself!\\'\\r\\nThey could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to\\r\\nthe window, which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly, and\\r\\nthen in a low and determined voice she said: \\'You will come and pick me\\r\\nup when he is gone,\\' and she jumped out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise, and a\\r\\nquarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his\\r\\nadventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get\\r\\nup, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to\\r\\nfetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate\\r\\ngirl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the\\r\\nbones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain, and merely\\r\\nsaid, with admirable resignation: \\'I am punished, well punished!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl\\'s friends and told them a\\r\\nmade-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed\\r\\nher, outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole\\r\\nmonth tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all! And I say that this woman was a heroine, and belonged to\\r\\nthe race of those who accomplished the grandest deeds in history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr,\\r\\na noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely\\r\\nadmire her, I should not have told you this story, which I would never\\r\\ntell anyone during her life: you understand why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor ceased; Mamma cried and Papa said some words which I did not\\r\\ncatch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the\\r\\narmchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps\\r\\nand something knocking against the side of the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were carrying away Clochette\\'s body.',\n"," 'THE MARQUIS DE FUMEROL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger de Toumeville was sitting astride a chair in the midst of his\\r\\nfriends and talking; he held a cigar in his hand, and from time to time\\r\\ntook a whiff and blew out a small cloud of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were at dinner when a letter was brought in and my father opened it.\\r\\nYou know my father, who thinks that he is king of France _ad interim_. I\\r\\ncall him Don Quixote, because for twelve years he has been running a\\r\\ntilt against the windmill of the Republic, without quite knowing whether\\r\\nit was in the name of the Bourbons or of the Orleans. At present he is\\r\\nholding the lance in the name of the Orleans alone, because there is\\r\\nnobody else but them left. In any case, he thinks himself the first\\r\\ngentleman in France, the best known, the most influential, the head of\\r\\nthe party; and as he is an irremovable senator, he thinks that the\\r\\nneighboring kings\\' thrones are very insecure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for my mother, she is my father\\'s soul, she is the soul of the\\r\\nkingdom and of religion, the right arm of God, and the scourge of\\r\\nevil-thinkers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, so a letter was brought in while we were at dinner, and my father\\r\\nopened and read it, and then he said to my mother: \\'Your brother is\\r\\ndying.\\' She grew very pale. My uncle was scarcely ever mentioned in the\\r\\nhouse, and I did not know him at all; all I knew from public talk was,\\r\\nthat he had led, and was still leading, the life of a buffoon. After\\r\\nhaving spent his fortune with an incalculable number of women, he had\\r\\nonly retained two mistresses, with whom he was living in small\\r\\napartments in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An ex-peer of France and ex-colonel of cavalry, it was said that he\\r\\nbelieved in neither God nor devil. Not believing, therefore, in a future\\r\\nlife he had abused this present life in every way, and he had become the\\r\\nliving wound of my mother\\'s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Give me that letter, Paul,\\' she said, and when she had read it, I\\r\\nasked for it in my turn. Here it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Monsieur le comte, I thinks I ought to lett you knaw that your\\r\\n     brother-law, count Fumeroll is going to dye. Perhapps you would\\r\\n     make preparations and not forgett that I told you._\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             _Your servant_,\\r\\n                                             MÉLANI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'We must think,\\' papa murmured. \\'In my position, I ought to watch over\\r\\nyour brother\\'s last moments.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma continued: \\'I will send for Abbé Poivron and ask his advice, and\\r\\nthen I will go to my brother\\'s with the abbé and Roger. Stop here Paul,\\r\\nfor you must not compromise yourself, but a woman can, and ought to do\\r\\nthese things. But for a politician in your position, it is another\\r\\nmatter. It would be a fine thing for one of your opponents to be able to\\r\\nbring one of your most laudable actions up against you.\\' \\'You are\\r\\nright,\\' my father said. \\'Do as you think best, my dear wife.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quarter of an hour later, the Abbé Poivron came into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and the situation was explained to him, analyzed and\\r\\ndiscussed in all its bearings. If the Marquis de Fumerol, one of the\\r\\ngreatest names in France, were to die without the succor of religion,\\r\\nit would assuredly be a terrible blow for the nobility in general, and\\r\\nfor the Count de Toumeville in particular, and the freethinkers would be\\r\\ntriumphant. The evilly disposed newspapers would sing songs of victory\\r\\nfor six months; my mother\\'s name would be dragged through the mire and\\r\\nbrought into the prose of Socialistic journals, and my father\\'s would be\\r\\nbespattered. It was impossible that such a thing should occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A crusade was therefore immediately decided upon, which was to be led\\r\\nby the Abbé Poivron, a little fat, clean, slightly scented priest, a\\r\\ntrue vicar of a large church in a noble and rich quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The landau was ordered and we started all three, my mother, the Curé\\r\\nand I, to administer the last sacraments to my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It had been decided first of all we should see Madame Mélani who had\\r\\nwritten the letter, and who was most likely the porter\\'s wife, or my\\r\\nuncle\\'s servant, and I got down as a scout in front of a seven-storied\\r\\nhouse and went into a dark passage, where I had great difficulty in\\r\\nfinding the porter\\'s den. He looked at me distrustfully, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame Mélani, if you please.\\' \\'Don\\'t know her!\\' \\'But I have received\\r\\na letter from her.\\' \\'That may be, but don\\'t know her. Are you asking for\\r\\nsome kept woman?\\' \\'No, a servant probably. She wrote me about a place.\\'\\r\\n\\'A servant?... a servant?... Perhaps it is the Marquis\\'s. Go and see,\\r\\nthe fifth story on the left.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as he found I was not asking for a kept woman, he became more\\r\\nfriendly and came as far as the passage with me. He was a tall, thin\\r\\nman with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic movements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I climbed up a long spiral staircase, whose balusters I did not venture\\r\\nto touch, and I gave three discreet knocks at the left-hand door on the\\r\\nfifth story. It opened immediately, and an enormous dirty woman appeared\\r\\nbefore me, who barred the entrance with her open arms which she leant\\r\\nagainst the two doorposts, and grumbled:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you want?\\' \\'Are you Madame Mélani?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'I am the Viscounte\\r\\nde Toumeville.\\' \\'Ah! All right! Come in.\\' \\'Well, the fact is my mother\\r\\nis downstairs with a priest.\\' \\'Oh! All right; go and bring them up; but\\r\\ntake care of the porter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went downstairs and came up again with my mother, who was followed by\\r\\nthe abbé, and I fancied that I heard other footsteps behind us. As soon\\r\\nas we were in the kitchen, Mélani offered us chairs, and we all four sat\\r\\ndown to deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is he very ill?\\' my mother asked. \\'Oh! yes, Madame; he will not be\\r\\nhere long.\\' \\'Does he seem disposed to receive a visit from a priest?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! I do not think so.\\' \\'Can I see him?\\' \\'Well ... yes ... Madame ...\\r\\nonly ... only ... those young ladies are with him.\\' \\'What young ladies?\\'\\r\\n\\'Why ... why ... his lady friends, of course.\\' \\'Oh!\\' Mamma had grown\\r\\nscarlet, and the Abbé Poivron had lowered his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The affair began to amuse me, and I said: \\'Suppose I go in first? I\\r\\nshall see how he receives me, and perhaps I shall be able to prepare his\\r\\nheart for you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother who did not suspect any trick, replied: \\'Yes, go my dear.\\'\\r\\nBut a woman\\'s voice cried out: \\'Mélani!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fat servant ran out and said: \\'What do you want, Mademoiselle\\r\\nClaire?\\' \\'The omelette, quickly.\\' \\'In a minute, Mademoiselle.\\' And\\r\\ncoming back to us, she explained this summons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'They ordered a cheese omelette at two o\\'clock as a slight collation.\\'\\r\\nAnd immediately she began to break the eggs into a salad bowl, and began\\r\\nto whip them vigorously, while I went out onto the landing and pulled\\r\\nthe bell, so as to announce my official arrival. Mélani opened the door\\r\\nto me, and made me sit down in an ante-room, while she went to tell my\\r\\nuncle, that I had come; then she came back and asked me to go in, while\\r\\nthe Abbé hid behind the door, so that he might appear at the first sign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very much surprised at seeing my uncle, for he was very\\r\\nhandsome, very solemn and very elegant, was the old rake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sitting, almost lying in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in\\r\\nblankets, with his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the\\r\\nchair, he was waiting death with Biblical dignity. His white beard fell\\r\\nonto his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled with it on\\r\\nhis cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Standing behind his armchair, as if to defend him against me, were two\\r\\nyoung women, two stout young women, who looked at me with the bold eyes\\r\\nof prostitutes. In their petticoats and morning wrappers, with bare\\r\\narms, with coal black hair twisted up onto the nape of their neck, with\\r\\nembroidered Oriental slippers which showed their ankles and silk\\r\\nstockings, they looked like the immoral figures of some symbolical\\r\\npainting, by the side of the dying man. Between the easy-chair and the\\r\\nbed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on which two plates,\\r\\ntwo glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting for the cheese\\r\\nomelette which had been ordered some time before of Mélani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle said in weak, almost breathless but clear voice: \\'Good\\r\\nmorning, my child: it is rather late in the day to come and see me; our\\r\\nacquaintance will not last long.\\' I stammered out: \\'It was not my fault,\\r\\nuncle,\\' ... and he replied: \\'No; I know that. It is your father and\\r\\nmother\\'s fault more than yours.... How are they?\\' \\'Pretty well, thank\\r\\nyou. When they heard that you were ill, they sent me to ask after you.\\'\\r\\n\\'Ah! Why did they not come themselves?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I looked up at the two girls and said gently: \\'It is not their fault if\\r\\nthey could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my father, and\\r\\nimpossible for my mother to come in here....\\' The old man did not reply,\\r\\nbut raised his hand towards mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and\\r\\nkept it in my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The door opened, Mélani came in with the omelette and put it on the\\r\\ntable, and the two girls immediately sat down in front of their plates\\r\\nand began to eat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: \\'Uncle,\\r\\nit would be a great pleasure for my mother to embrace you.\\' \\'I also ...\\'\\r\\nhe murmured, \\'should like....\\' He said no more, and I could think of\\r\\nnothing to propose to him, and nothing more was heard except the noise\\r\\nof the plates and that vague movement of eating mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now the Abbé, who was listening behind the door, seeing our\\r\\nembarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had\\r\\ncome to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at that\\r\\napparition, that at first he remained motionless; but then he opened his\\r\\nmouth as if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in a\\r\\nstrong, deep, furious voice: \\'What are you doing here?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé, who was used to difficult situations came further in the\\r\\nroom, murmuring: \\'I have come in your sister\\'s name, Monsieur le\\r\\nMarquis; she has sent me.... She would be so happy, Monsieur....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the Marquis was not listening. Raising one hand, he pointed to the\\r\\ndoor with a proud and tragic gesture, and he said angrily and gasping\\r\\nfor breath: \\'Leave this room ... go out ... robber of souls.... Go out\\r\\nfrom here, you violator of consciences.... Go out from here, you\\r\\npicklock of dying men\\'s doors!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé went backwards, and I also went to the door, beating a retreat\\r\\nwith the clergyman; and the two little women who were avenged got up,\\r\\nleaving their omelette only half eaten, and went and stood on either\\r\\nside of my uncle\\'s armchair, putting their hands on his arms to calm\\r\\nhim, and to protect him against the criminal enterprises of the Family\\r\\nand of Religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé and I rejoined my mother in the kitchen, and Mélani again\\r\\noffered us chairs, \\'I knew quite well that it would not go of its own\\r\\naccord; we must try some other means, otherwise he will escape us.\\' And\\r\\nthey began deliberating afresh, my mother being of one opinion and the\\r\\nAbbé of another, while I held a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had been discussing the matter in a low voice for half an hour,\\r\\nperhaps, when a great noise of furniture being moved and of cries\\r\\nuttered by my uncle, more vehement and terrible even, than the former\\r\\nhad been, made us all four jump up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Through the doors and walls we could hear him shouting: \\'Go out ... out\\r\\n... rascals, ... humbugs, get out scoundrels ... get out ... get\\r\\nout!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélani rushed in, but came back immediately to call me to help her, and\\r\\nI hastened in. Opposite to my uncle who was terribly excited by anger,\\r\\nalmost standing up and vociferating, two men, one behind the other,\\r\\nseemed to be waiting till he should be dead with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By his long, ridiculous coat, his long English shoes, by his manners of\\r\\na tutor out of a situation, by his high collar, white necktie and\\r\\nstraight hair, by his humble face of a priest, I immediately recognized\\r\\nthe first as a Protestant minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The second was the porter of the house, who belonged to the reformed\\r\\nreligion and had followed us, and having seen our defeat had gone to\\r\\nfetch his own priest, in hopes of a better fate. My uncle seemed mad\\r\\nwith rage! If the sight of the Catholic priest, of the priest of his\\r\\nancestors, had irritated the Marquis de Fumerol, who had become a\\r\\nfreethinker, the sight of his porter\\'s minister made him altogether\\r\\nbeside himself. I therefore took the two men by the arm and threw them\\r\\nout of the room so violently that they embraced each other twice,\\r\\nbetween the two doors which led to the staircase, and then I disappeared\\r\\nin my turn and returned to the kitchen, which was our headquarters, in\\r\\norder to take counsel with my mother and the Abbé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mélani came back in terror, sobbing out: \\'He is dying ... he is\\r\\ndying ... come immediately ... he is dying....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother rushed out. My uncle had fallen onto the ground, full length\\r\\nalong the floor, and did not move. I fancy he was already dead. My\\r\\nmother was superb at that moment! She went straight up to the two girls\\r\\nwho were kneeling by the body and trying to raise it up, and pointing to\\r\\nthe door with irresistible authority, dignity and majesty, she said:\\r\\n\\'Now it is for you to go out.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they went out without a protest, and without saying a word. I must\\r\\nadd, that I was getting ready to turn them out as unceremoniously as I\\r\\nhad done the parson and the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the Abbé Poivron administered the last sacrament to my uncle with\\r\\nall the customary prayers and remitted all his sins, while my mother\\r\\nsobbed, kneeling near her brother. Suddenly, however, she exclaimed: \\'He\\r\\nrecognized me; he pressed my hand; I am sure he recognized me!!!... and\\r\\nthat he thanked me! Oh, God, what happiness!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Mamma! If she had known or guessed to whom those thanks ought to\\r\\nhave been addressed!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They laid my uncle on his bed; he was certainly dead that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame,\\' Mélani said, \\'we have no sheets to bury him in; all the linen\\r\\nbelongs to those two young ladies,\\' and when I looked at the omelette\\r\\nwhich they had not finished, I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the\\r\\nsame time. There are some strange moments and some strange sensations in\\r\\nlife, occasionally!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We gave my uncle a magnificent funeral, with five speeches at the\\r\\ngrave. Baron de Croiselles, the Senator, showed in admirable terms, that\\r\\nGod always returns victorious into well-born souls which have gone\\r\\nastray for a moment. All the members of the Royalist and Catholic party\\r\\nfollowed the funeral procession with the enthusiasm of triumphers,\\r\\nspeaking of that beautiful death, after a somewhat restless life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nViscount Roger ceased speaking, and those around him laughed. Then\\r\\nsomebody said: \"Bah! That is the story of conversions _in Extremis_.\"',\n"," 'THE SIGNAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon was still asleep in her closed and\\r\\nperfumed bedroom, in her soft, low bed, between her sheets of delicate\\r\\ncambric, fine as lace and caressing as a kiss; she was sleeping alone\\r\\nand tranquil, the happy and profound sleep of divorced women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was awakened by loud voices in the little blue drawing-room, and she\\r\\nrecognized her dear friend, the little Baroness de Grangerie, who was\\r\\ndisputing with the lady\\'s maid, because the latter would not allow her\\r\\nto go into her mistress\\' room. So the little Marchioness got up, opened\\r\\nthe door, drew back the door-hangings and showed her head, nothing but\\r\\nher fair head, hidden under a cloud of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, that you have come so early?\" she asked.\\r\\n\"It is not nine o\\'clock yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little baroness who was very pale, nervous and feverish, replied: \"I\\r\\nmust speak to you. Something horrible has happened to me.\" \"Come in, my\\r\\ndear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went in, they kissed each other, and the little Marchioness got back\\r\\ninto her bed while the lady\\'s maid opened the windows to let in light\\r\\nand air, and then when she had left the room, Madame de Rennedon went\\r\\non: \"Well, tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame de Grangerie began to cry, shedding those pretty, bright tears\\r\\nwhich make woman more charming, and she stammered without wiping her\\r\\neyes, so as not to make them red: \"Oh! my dear, what has happened to me\\r\\nis abominable, abominable. I have not slept all night, not a minute; do\\r\\nyou hear, not a minute. Here, just feel my heart, how it is beating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, taking her friend\\'s hand, she put it on her breast, on that firm,\\r\\nround covering of women\\'s hearts which often suffices men, and prevents\\r\\nthem from seeking beneath. But her breast was really beating violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"It happened to me yesterday during the day, at about\\r\\nfour o\\'clock ... or half-past four; I cannot say exactly. You know my\\r\\napartments, and you know that my little drawing-room, where I always\\r\\nsit, looks onto the Rue Saint-Lazare, and that I have a mania for\\r\\nsitting at the window to look at the people passing. The neighborhood of\\r\\nthe railway station is very gay; so full of motion and lively.... Well,\\r\\nthat is just what I like! So, yesterday, I was sitting in the low chair\\r\\nwhich I have placed in my window recess; the window was open and I was\\r\\nnot thinking of anything; I was breathing the fresh air. You remember\\r\\nhow fine it was yesterday!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly, I remarked that there was also a woman sitting at the window,\\r\\na woman in red; I was in mauve, you know, my pretty mauve costume. I did\\r\\nnot know the woman, a new lodger, who had been there a month, and as it\\r\\nhad been raining for a month, I had not yet seen her, but I saw\\r\\nimmediately that she was a bad girl. At first I was very much shocked\\r\\nand disgusted that she should be at the window like I was; and then, by\\r\\ndegrees, it amused me to examine her. She was resting her elbows on the\\r\\nwindow ledge, and looking at the men, and the men looked at her also,\\r\\nall or nearly all. One might have said that they were apprised\\r\\nbeforehand by some means as they got near the house, which they scented\\r\\nas dogs scent game, for they suddenly raised their heads, and exchanged\\r\\na swift look with her, a freemason\\'s look. Hers said: \\'Will you?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theirs replied: \\'I have no time,\\' or else: \\'another day;\\' or else: \\'I\\r\\nhave not got a half penny;\\' or else: \\'Will you hide yourself, you\\r\\nwretch!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine how funny it was to see her carrying on such a piece\\r\\nof work, though, after all, it is her regular business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes she shut the window suddenly, and I saw a gentleman go in.\\r\\nShe had caught him like a fisherman hooks a gudgeon. Then I looked at my\\r\\nwatch, and I found that they stopped from twelve to twenty minutes,\\r\\nnever longer. In the end she really infatuated me, the spider! And then\\r\\nthe creature is so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked myself: How does she manage to make herself understood so\\r\\nquickly, so well and so completely? Does she add a sign of the head or a\\r\\nmotion of the hands to her looks? And I took my opera-glasses to watch\\r\\nher proceedings. Oh! they were very simple: first of all a glance, then\\r\\na smile, then a slight sign with the head, which meant: \\'Are you coming\\r\\nup?\\' But it was so slight, so vague, so discreet, that it required a\\r\\ngreat deal of knack to succeed as she did. And I asked myself: \\'I wonder\\r\\nif I could do that little movement, from below upwards, which was at the\\r\\nsame time bold and pretty, as well as she does,\\' for her gesture was\\r\\nvery pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went and tried it before the looking-glass, and, my dear, I did it\\r\\nbetter than she, a great deal better! I was enchanted, and resumed my\\r\\nplace at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She caught nobody more then, poor girl, nobody. She certainly had no\\r\\nluck. It must really be very terrible to earn one\\'s bread in that way,\\r\\nterrible and amusing occasionally, for really some of these men one\\r\\nmeets in the street are rather nice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After that they all came on my side of the road and none on hers; the\\r\\nsun had turned. They came one after the other, young, old, dark, fair,\\r\\ngray, white. I saw some who looked very nice, really very nice, my dear,\\r\\nfar better than my husband or than yours, I mean than your late husband,\\r\\nas you have got a divorce. Now you can choose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said to myself! If I give them the sign, will they understand me, who\\r\\nam a respectable woman? And I was seized with a mad longing to make that\\r\\nsign to them. I had a longing, the longing of a pregnant woman ... a\\r\\nterrible longing; you know, one of those longings which one cannot\\r\\nresist! I have some like that occasionally. How stupid such things are,\\r\\ndon\\'t you think so? I believe that we woman have the souls of monkeys. I\\r\\nhave been told (and it was a physician who told me) that the brain of a\\r\\nmonkey was very like ours. Of course we must imitate some one or other.\\r\\nWe imitate our husbands, when we love them, during the first months\\r\\nafter our marriage, and then our lovers, our female friends, our\\r\\nconfessors, when they are nice. We assume their ways of thought, their\\r\\nmanners of speech, their words, their gestures, everything. It is very\\r\\nstupid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, as for me, when I am too much tempted to do a thing I always\\r\\ndo it, and so I said to myself: \\'I will try it once, on one man only,\\r\\njust to see. What can happen to me? Nothing whatever! We shall exchange\\r\\na smile and that will be all, and I shall deny it, most certainly.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I began to make my choice. I wanted someone nice, very nice, and\\r\\nsuddenly I saw a tall, fair, very good-looking fellow coming along. I\\r\\nlike fair men, as you know. I looked at him, he looked at me; I smiled,\\r\\nhe smiled; I made the movement; oh! but scarcely; he replied _yes_ with\\r\\nhis head, and there he was, my dear! He came in at the large door of the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine what passed through my mind then! I thought I should\\r\\ngo mad. Oh! how frightened I was. Just think, he will speak to the\\r\\nservants! To Joseph, who is devoted to my husband! Joseph would\\r\\ncertainly think that I had known that gentleman for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could I do, just tell me? And he would ring in a moment. What\\r\\ncould I do, tell me? I thought I would go and meet him, and tell him he\\r\\nhad made a mistake, and beg him to go away. He would have pity on a\\r\\nwoman, on a poor woman: So I rushed to the door and opened it, just at\\r\\nthe moment when he was going to ring the bell, and I stammered out,\\r\\nquite stupidly: \\'Go away, Monsieur, go away; you have made a mistake, a\\r\\nterrible mistake; I took you for one of my friends whom you are very\\r\\nlike. Have pity on me, Monsieur.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he only began to laugh, my dear, and replied: \\'Good morning, my\\r\\ndear, I know all about your little story, you may be sure. You are\\r\\nmarried, and so you want forty francs instead of twenty, and you shall\\r\\nhave them, so just show the way.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he pushed me in, closed the door, and as I remained standing\\r\\nbefore him, horror-struck, he kissed me, put his arm round my waist and\\r\\nmade me go back into the drawing-room, which had remained open. Then he\\r\\nbegan to look at everything, like an auctioneer, and continued: \\'By\\r\\nJove, it is very nice in your rooms, very well. You must be very down on\\r\\nyour luck just now, to do the window business!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I began to beg him again: \\'Oh! Monsieur, go away, please go away!\\r\\nMy husband will be coming in soon, it is just his time. I swear that you\\r\\nhave made a mistake!\\' But he answered quite coolly: \\'Come, my beauty, I\\r\\nhave had enough of this nonsense, and if your husband comes in, I will\\r\\ngive him five francs to go and have a drink at the café opposite.\\' And\\r\\nthen, seeing Raoul\\'s photograph on the chimney-piece, he asked me: \\'Is\\r\\nthat your ... your husband?\\' \\'Yes, that is he.\\' \\'He looks a nice,\\r\\ndisagreeable sort of fellow. And who is this? One of your friends?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was your photograph, my dear, you know, the one in ball dress. I did\\r\\nnot know any longer what I was saying, and I stammered: \\'Yes, it is one\\r\\nof my friends.\\' \\'She is very nice; you shall introduce me to her.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then the clock struck five, and Raoul comes home every day at half\\r\\npast! Suppose he were to come home before the other had gone, just fancy\\r\\nwhat would have happened! Then ... then ... I completely lost my head\\r\\n... altogether.... I thought ... I thought ... that ... that ... the\\r\\nbest thing would be ... to get rid ... of ... of this man ... as quickly\\r\\nas possible.... The sooner it was over ... you understand ... and ...\\r\\nand there ... as it must be done ... and I was obliged, my dear ... he\\r\\nwould not have gone away without it.... Well I ... I locked the\\r\\ndrawing-room door.... There!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon had begun to laugh, to laugh madly,\\r\\nwith her head buried in her pillow, so that the whole bed shook, and\\r\\nwhen she was a little calmer she asked: \"And ... and ... was he\\r\\ngood-looking?\" \"Yes.\" \"And yet you complain?\" \"But ... but ... don\\'t you\\r\\nsee, my dear, he said ... he said ... he should come again to-morrow ...\\r\\nat the same time ... and I ... I am terribly frightened.... You have no\\r\\nidea how tenacious he is and obstinate.... What can I do ... tell me ...\\r\\nwhat can I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness sat up in bed to reflect, and then she suddenly\\r\\nsaid: \"Have him arrested!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness looked stupefied, and stammered out: \"What do you\\r\\nsay? What are you thinking of? Have him arrested? Under what pretext?\"\\r\\n\"That is very simple. Go to the Commissary of Police and say that a\\r\\ngentleman has been following you about for three months; that he had the\\r\\ninsolence to go up to your apartments yesterday; that he has threatened\\r\\nyou with another visit to-morrow, and that you demand the protection of\\r\\nthe law, and they will give you two police officers, who will arrest\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, suppose he tells....\" \"They will not believe him, you\\r\\nsilly thing, if you have told your tale cleverly to the commissary, but\\r\\nthey will believe you, who are an irreproachable woman, and in\\r\\nsociety.\" \"Oh! I shall never dare to do it.\" \"You must dare, my dear, or\\r\\nyou are lost.\" \"But think that he will ... he will insult me if he is\\r\\narrested.\" \"Very well, you will have witnesses, and he will be\\r\\nsentenced.\" \"Sentenced to what?\" \"To pay damages. In such cases, one\\r\\nmust be pitiless!\" \"Ah! speaking of damages.... There is one thing that\\r\\nworries me very much ... very much indeed.... He left me two twenty\\r\\nfranc pieces on the mantelpiece.\" \"Two twenty franc pieces?\" \"Yes.\" \"No\\r\\nmore?\" \"No.\" \"That is very little. It would have humiliated me. Well?\"\\r\\n\"Well! What am I to do with that money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness hesitated for a few seconds, and then she replied\\r\\nin a serious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear ... you must make ... you must make your husband a little\\r\\npresent with it.... That will be only fair!\"',\n"," 'THE DEVIL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was standing opposite the doctor, by the bedside of the\\r\\ndying old woman, and she, calmly resigned and quite lucid, looked at\\r\\nthem and listened to their talking. She was going to die, and she did\\r\\nnot rebel at it, for her time was over, as she was ninety-two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its\\r\\nhot flames onto the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down\\r\\nby four generations of clod-hoppers. The smell of the fields came in\\r\\nalso, driven by the sharp wind, and parched by the noontide heat. The\\r\\ngrasshoppers chirped themselves hoarse, and filled the country with\\r\\ntheir shrill noise, which was like that of the wooden crickets which are\\r\\nsold to children at fair time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor raised his voice and said: \"Honoré, you cannot leave your\\r\\nmother in this state; she may die at any moment.\" And the peasant, in\\r\\ngreat distress replied: \"But I must get in my wheat, for it has been\\r\\nlying on the ground a long time, and the weather is just right for it;\\r\\nwhat do you say about it, mother?\" And the dying old woman, still\\r\\ntormented by her Norman avariciousness, replied _yes_ with her eyes and\\r\\nher forehead, and so urged her son to get in his wheat, and to leave her\\r\\nto die alone, but the doctor got angry, and stamping his foot, he said:\\r\\n\"You are no better than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you\\r\\nto do it, do you understand? And if you must get in your wheat to-day,\\r\\ngo and fetch Rapet\\'s wife and make her look after your mother. I will\\r\\nhave it, do you understand me? And if you do not obey me, I will let you\\r\\ndie like a dog, when you are ill in your turn; do you hear me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was tormented\\r\\nby indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his fierce love of saving,\\r\\nhesitated, calculated and stammered out: \"How much does la Rapet charge\\r\\nfor attending sick people?\" \"How should I know?\" the doctor cried. \"That\\r\\ndepends upon how long she is wanted for. Settle it with her, by Jove!\\r\\nBut I want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the man made up his mind: \"I will go for her,\" he replied; \"don\\'t get\\r\\nangry, doctor.\" And the latter left, calling out as he went: \"Take care,\\r\\nyou know, for I do not joke when I am angry!\" And as soon as they were\\r\\nalone, the peasant turned to his mother and said in a resigned voice: \"I\\r\\nwill go and fetch la Rapet, as the man will have it. Don\\'t go off while\\r\\nI am away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went out in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet, who was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the dying of\\r\\nthe neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sown her customers into\\r\\nthat linen cloth from which they would emerge no more, she went and took\\r\\nup her iron to smooth the linen of the living. Wrinkled like a last\\r\\nyear\\'s apple, spiteful, envious, avaricious with a phenomenal avarice,\\r\\nbent double, as if she had been broken in half across the loins, by the\\r\\nconstant movement of the iron over the linen, one might have said that\\r\\nshe had a kind of monstrous and cynical affection for a death struggle.\\r\\nShe never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of the\\r\\nvarious kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and she related\\r\\nwith the greatest minuteness, details which were always the same, just\\r\\nlike a sportsman recounts his shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Honoré Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing the\\r\\nstarch for the collars of the village women, and he said: \"Good evening;\\r\\nI hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head round to look at him, and said: \"Fairly well, fairly\\r\\nwell, and you?\" \"Oh! as for me, I am as well as I could wish, but my\\r\\nmother is very poorly.\" \"Your mother?\" \"Yes, my mother!\" \"What\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her?\" \"She is going to turn up her toes, that\\'s what\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with sudden\\r\\nsympathy: \"Is she as bad as all that?\" \"The doctor says she will not\\r\\nlast till morning.\" \"Then she certainly is very bad!\" Honoré hesitated,\\r\\nfor he wanted to make a few preambulatory remarks before coming to his\\r\\nproposal, but as he could hit upon nothing, he made up his mind\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much are you going to ask to stop with her till the end? You know\\r\\nthat I am not rich, and I cannot even afford to keep a servant-girl. It\\r\\nis just that which has brought my poor mother to this state, too much\\r\\nwork and fatigue! She used to work for ten, in spite of her ninety-two\\r\\nyears. You don\\'t find any made of that stuff nowadays!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet answered gravely: \"There are two prices: Forty sous by day and\\r\\nthree francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by day, and forty by\\r\\nnight for the others. You shall pay me the twenty and forty.\" But the\\r\\npeasant reflected, for he knew his mother well. He knew how tenacious of\\r\\nlife, vigorous and unyielding she was, and she might last another week,\\r\\nin spite of the doctor\\'s opinion, and so he said resolutely: \"No, I\\r\\nwould rather you would fix a price until the end. I will take my chance,\\r\\none way or the other. The doctor says she will die very soon. If that\\r\\nhappens so much the better for you, and so much the worse for me, but if\\r\\nshe holds out till to-morrow or longer, so much the better for me and so\\r\\nmuch the worse for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a\\r\\ndeath as a speculative job, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of\\r\\nthe possible gain, but almost immediately she suspected that he wanted\\r\\nto juggle her, \"I can say nothing until I have seen your mother,\" she\\r\\nreplied. \"Then come with me and see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe washed her hands, and went with him immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps,\\r\\nwhile he strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at\\r\\nevery step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their\\r\\nheads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them\\r\\nfor some green grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got near the house, Honoré Bontemps murmured: \"Suppose it is\\r\\nall over?\" And the unconscious wish which he had that it might be so,\\r\\nshowed itself in the sound of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her\\r\\nwretched bed, her hands covered with a pink cotton counterpane, horribly\\r\\nthin, knotty hands, like strange animals, like crabs, and closed by\\r\\nrheumatism, fatigue, and the work of nearly a century which she had\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt her\\r\\npulse, tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing, and asked her\\r\\nquestions, so as to hear her speak: and then, having looked at her for\\r\\nsome time longer, she went out of the room, followed by Honoré. Her\\r\\ndecided opinion was that the old woman would not last out the night, and\\r\\nhe asked: \"Well?\" And the sick-nurse replied: \"Well, she may last two\\r\\ndays, perhaps three. You will have to give me six francs, everything\\r\\nincluded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six francs! six francs!\" he shouted. \"Are you out of your mind? I tell\\r\\nyou that she cannot last more than five or six hours!\" And they disputed\\r\\nangrily for some time, but as the nurse said she would go home, as the\\r\\ntime was going by, and as his wheat would not come to the farmyard of\\r\\nits own accord, he agreed to her terms at last:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well then, that is settled; six francs including everything, until\\r\\nthe corpse is taken out.\" \"That is settled, six francs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went away, with long strides, to his wheat, which was lying on\\r\\nthe ground under the hot sun, which ripens the grain, while the\\r\\nsick-nurse returned to the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had brought some work with her, for she worked without stopping by\\r\\nthe side of the dead and the dying, sometimes for herself, sometimes for\\r\\nthe family which employed her as seamstress also, paying her rather\\r\\nmore in that capacity. Suddenly she asked: \"Have you received the last\\r\\nsacraments, Mother Bontemps?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old peasant woman said \"no\" with her head, and la Rapet, who was\\r\\nvery devout, got up quickly: \"Good heavens, is it possible? I will go\\r\\nand fetch the Curé;\" and she rushed off to the parsonage so quickly,\\r\\nthat the urchins in the street thought some accident had happened, when\\r\\nthey saw her trotting off like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a choir-boy,\\r\\nwho rang a bell, to announce the passage of the Host through the parched\\r\\nand quiet country. Some men, who were working at a distance, took off\\r\\ntheir large hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had\\r\\ndisappeared behind some farm buildings; the women who were making up the\\r\\nsheaves, stood up to make the sign of the cross; the frightened black\\r\\nhens ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole\\r\\nthrough which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal, which was tied up\\r\\nin a meadow, took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to turn\\r\\nround at the length of its rope, kicking violently. The choir-boy, in\\r\\nhis red cassock, walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined\\r\\ntowards one shoulder, and with his square biretta on his head, followed\\r\\nhim, muttering some prayers, and last of all came la Rapet, bent almost\\r\\ndouble, as if she wished to prostrate herself as she walked with folded\\r\\nhands, as if she were in church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonoré saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: \"Where is our priest\\r\\ngoing to?\" And his man, who was more acute, replied: \"He is taking the\\r\\nsacrament to your mother, of course!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was not surprised, and said: \"That is quite possible,\" and\\r\\nwent on with his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and communion, and the\\r\\npriest took his departure, leaving the two women alone in the\\r\\nsuffocating cottage, while la Rapet began to look at the dying woman,\\r\\nand to ask herself whether it could last much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was on the wane, and a cooler air came in stronger puffs, and\\r\\nmade a view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two pins, flap\\r\\nup and down, the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white,\\r\\nbut were now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were\\r\\ngoing to fly off and seemed to struggle to get away, like the old\\r\\nwoman\\'s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lying motionless, with her eyes open, seemed to await that death\\r\\nwhich was so near and which yet delayed its coming, with perfect\\r\\nindifference. Her short breath whistled in her tightening throat. It\\r\\nwould stop altogether soon, and there would be one woman less in the\\r\\nworld, whom nobody would regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nightfall Honoré returned, and when he went up to the bed and saw\\r\\nthat his mother was still alive, he asked: \"How is she?\" just as he had\\r\\ndone formerly, when she had been unwell, and then he sent la Rapet away,\\r\\nsaying to her: \"To-morrow morning at five o\\'clock, without fail.\" And\\r\\nshe replied: \"To-morrow, at five o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came at daybreak, and found Honoré eating his soup, which he had\\r\\nmade himself, before going to work, and the sick-nurse asked him: \"Well,\\r\\nis your mother dead?\" \"She is rather better, on the contrary,\" he\\r\\nreplied, with a malignant look out of the corner of his eyes. And he\\r\\nwent out.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was seized with anxiety, and went up to the dying woman, who\\r\\nremained in the same state, lethargic and impassive, with her eyes open\\r\\nand her hands clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that this\\r\\nmight go on thus for two days, four days, eight days, and her avaricious\\r\\nmind was seized with fear, while she was excited to furious rage against\\r\\nthe cunning fellow who had tricked her, and against the woman, who would\\r\\nnot die.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she began to work and waited with her looks fixed on the\\r\\nwrinkled face of Mother Bontemps, and when Honoré returned to breakfast\\r\\nhe seemed quite satisfied and even in a bantering humor, for he was\\r\\ndecidedly carrying in his wheat under very favorable circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was getting exasperated; every minute passed now seemed to her\\r\\nso much time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad inclination to\\r\\ntake this old ass, this headstrong old fool, this obstinate old wretch,\\r\\nand to stop that short, rapid breath, which was robbing her of her time\\r\\nand money, by squeezing her throat a little. But then, she reflected on\\r\\nthe danger of doing so, and other thoughts came into her head, so she\\r\\nwent up to the bed and said to her: \"Have you ever seen the Devil?\"\\r\\nMother Bontemps whispered: \"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales which were\\r\\nlikely to terrify her weak and dying mind. Some minutes before one died\\r\\nthe Devil appeared, she said, to all who were in their death throes. He\\r\\nhad a broom in his hand, a saucepan on his head, and he uttered loud\\r\\ncries. When anybody had seen him, all was over, and that person had only\\r\\na few moments longer to live; and she enumerated all those to whom the\\r\\nDevil had appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie Ratier, Sophie\\r\\nPadagnau, Séraphine Grospied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps, who was at last most disturbed in mind, moved about,\\r\\nwrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look at the bottom of the\\r\\nroom, and suddenly la Rapet disappeared at the foot of the bed. She took\\r\\na sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped herself up in it; she put the\\r\\niron pot onto her head, so that its three short bent feet rose up like\\r\\nhorns, and she took a broom in her right hand and a tin pail in her\\r\\nleft, which she threw up suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground\\r\\nnoisily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd certainly when it came down, it made a terrible noise; then,\\r\\nclimbing onto a chair, the nurse lifted up the curtain which hung at the\\r\\nbottom of the bed, and showed herself, gesticulating and uttering shrill\\r\\ncries into the pot which covered her face, while she menaced the old\\r\\npeasant woman, who was nearly dead, with her broom.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, with a mad look on her face, the dying woman made a\\r\\nsuperhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her shoulders and\\r\\nchest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep sigh. All was over, and\\r\\nla Rapet calmly put everything back into its place; the broom into the\\r\\ncorner by the cupboard, the sheet inside it, the pot on the hearth, the\\r\\npail on the floor and the chair against the wall. Then, with\\r\\nprofessional movements, she closed the dead woman\\'s enormous eyes, put\\r\\na plate on the bed and poured some holy water into it, dipped the twig\\r\\nof boxwood into it, and kneeling down, she fervently repeated the\\r\\nprayers for the dead, which she knew by heart, as a matter of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Honoré returned in the evening, he found her praying, and he\\r\\ncalculated immediately that she had made twenty sous out of him, for she\\r\\nhad only spent three days and one night there, which made five francs\\r\\naltogether, instead of the six which he owed her.',\n"," 'EPIPHANY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Captain Count de Garens, \"I should rather think that I do\\r\\nremember it, that supper of the Kings, during the war!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was at the time quarter-master of cavalry, and for a fortnight had\\r\\nbeen lurking about as a scout in front of the German advanced guard. The\\r\\nevening before we had cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one\\r\\nof whom was that poor little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de\\r\\nRaudeville well, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on that day my captain ordered me to take six troopers and to go\\r\\nand occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five fights in\\r\\nthree weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty houses left\\r\\nstanding, not a dozen houses in that wasp\\'s nest. So I took ten\\r\\ntroopers, and set out at about four o\\'clock and at five o\\'clock, while\\r\\nit was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I\\r\\nhalted and ordered Marchas, you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterwards\\r\\nmarried little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de\\r\\nMartel-Auvelin, to go alone into the village, and to report to me what\\r\\nhe saw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had chosen nothing but volunteers, and all of good family. It is\\r\\npleasant when on service not to be forced to be on intimate terms with\\r\\nunpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as sharp as possible, as cunning as\\r\\na fox and as supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as well\\r\\nas a dog can scent a hare, could find victuals where we should have\\r\\ndied of hunger without him, and he obtained information from everybody,\\r\\nand information which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In ten minutes he returned. \\'All right,\\' he said; \\'there have been no\\r\\nPrussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is this village.\\r\\nI have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is attending to four or\\r\\nfive wounded men in an abandoned convent.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ordered them to ride on, and we penetrated into the principal street.\\r\\nOn the right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were\\r\\nhardly visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was\\r\\nburning in a room; some family had remained to keep its house standing\\r\\nas much as they were able; a family of brave, or of poor, people. The\\r\\nrain had begun to fall, a fine, icy cold rain, which froze us before it\\r\\nwetted us through, by merely touching our cloaks. The horses stumbled\\r\\nagainst stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided us,\\r\\ngoing before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where are you taking us to?\\' I asked him. And he replied: \\'I have a\\r\\nplace for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.\\' And soon we stopped\\r\\nbefore a small house, evidently belonging to some owner of the middle\\r\\nclasses, quite enclosed, built near the street and with a garden in the\\r\\nrear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marchas broke open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up\\r\\nnear the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front\\r\\ndoor with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was\\r\\nnever without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of\\r\\nsome rich private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as\\r\\nif he had lived in this house which he now saw for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to stout Ponderel, who followed him: \\'The stables must be on the\\r\\nleft; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we\\r\\ndo not want them,\\' and then turning to me he said: \\'Give your orders,\\r\\nconfound it all!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: \\'I shall\\r\\npost my sentinels at the country approaches and I will return to you\\r\\nhere?\\' \\'How many man men are you going to take?\\' \\'Five. The others will\\r\\nrelieve them at five o\\'clock in the evening.\\' \\'Very well. Leave me four\\r\\nto look after provisions, to do the cooking and to set the table. I will\\r\\ngo and find out where the wine is hidden away.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went off, to reconnoiter the deserted streets, until they ended in\\r\\nthe open country, so as to post my sentries there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Half an hour later I was back, and I found Marchas lounging in a great\\r\\narmchair, the covering of which he had taking off, from love of luxury\\r\\nas he said. He was warming his feet at the fire, and smoking an\\r\\nexcellent cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows\\r\\nresting on the arms of the chair, his shoulders, his cheeks flushed, his\\r\\neyes bright, and looking delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to me, smiling in a beatific manner: \\'This is famous; I found the\\r\\nchampagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy--fifty bottles\\r\\nof the very finest--in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which did\\r\\nnot look to me to be quite straight, when I looked at it by the light\\r\\nof my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck and\\r\\nthree pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful\\r\\npart of the country.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had sat down opposite to him, and the fire in the grate was burning\\r\\nmy nose and cheeks. \\'Where did you find this wood?\\' I asked. \\'Splendid\\r\\nwood,\\' he replied. \\'The owner\\'s carriage. It is the paint which is\\r\\ncausing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A capital\\r\\nhouse!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I laughed for I found the creature was funny, and he went on: \\'Fancy\\r\\nthis being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose, but there\\r\\nis no queen; it is really very annoying!\\' And I repeated like an echo:\\r\\n\\'It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the matter?\\' \\'To find\\r\\nsome, of course. Some women,\\' \\'Women?... you must be mad?\\' \\'I managed to\\r\\nfind the brandy under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps;\\r\\nand yet there was nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is\\r\\na sure sign. Go and look, old fellow.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was\\r\\njoking or not, and so I replied: \\'Look here, Marchas, are you having a\\r\\njoke with me?\\' \\'I never joke on duty.\\' \\'But where the devil do you\\r\\nexpect me to find any women?\\' \\'Where you like, there must be two or\\r\\nthree remaining in the neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them\\r\\nhere.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas went on:\\r\\n\\'Do you want an idea?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'Go and see the priest.\\' \\'The priest? What\\r\\nfor?\\' \\'Ask him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.\\' \\'The\\r\\npriest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity; \\'I am not laughing,\\r\\ngo and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as his\\r\\nmust be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one woman\\r\\nat least, a lady, of course, since we are all men of the world. He is\\r\\nsure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if\\r\\nthere is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will indicate her to\\r\\nyou.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?\\' \\'My dear Garens, you\\r\\ncan do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We are well bred, by\\r\\njove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners and our grandest\\r\\nstyle. Tell the Abbé who we are, make him laugh, soften him, seduce him\\r\\nand persuade him!\\' \\'No, it is impossible.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my weak side, the scamp\\r\\ncontinued: \\'Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to do, and how\\r\\namusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and it will\\r\\ngive you a famous reputation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and so he persisted:\\r\\n\\'Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and you\\r\\nalone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood. I\\r\\nbeg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war, I will relate\\r\\nthe whole affair in verse in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. You owe this\\r\\nmuch to your men, for you have made them march enough during the last\\r\\nmonth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up at last and asked: \\'Where is the parsonage?\\' \\'Take the second\\r\\nturning at the end of the street, you will see an avenue, and at the end\\r\\nof the avenue you will find the church. The parsonage is beside it.\\' As\\r\\nI went out, he called out: \\'Tell him the bill of fare, to make him\\r\\nhungry!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I discovered the ecclesiastic\\'s little house without any difficulty; it\\r\\nwas by the side of a large, ugly, brick church. I knocked at the door\\r\\nwith my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice\\r\\nfrom inside asked: \\'Who is there?\\' To which I replied: \\'A quarter-master\\r\\nof the hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and I found\\r\\nmyself face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest\\r\\nof a prize-fighter, formidable hands projecting from turned up sleeves,\\r\\na red face and the looks of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and\\r\\nsaid: \\'Good day, Monsieur le Curé.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had feared a surprise, some marauders\\' ambush, and he smiled as he\\r\\nreplied: \\'Good day, my friend; come in.\\' I followed him into a small\\r\\nroom with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very\\r\\ndifferent to Marchas\\' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: \\'What\\r\\ncan I do for you?\\' \\'Monsieur, allow me first of all to introduce\\r\\nmyself;\\' and I gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: _The\\r\\nComte de Garens_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I continued: \\'There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l\\'Abbé, five on\\r\\ngrand guard, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant.\\r\\nThe names of the six are, Garens, (that is I), Pierre de Marchas,\\r\\nLudovic de Ponderel, Baron d\\'Etreillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter\\'s\\r\\nson and Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in\\r\\ntheir name and my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an\\r\\nEpiphany supper, Monsieur le Curé, and we should like to make it a\\r\\nlittle cheerful.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest smiled and murmured: \\'It seems to me to be hardly a suitable\\r\\noccasion for amusing oneself.\\' And I replied: \\'We are fighting every\\r\\nday, Monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been killed in a month, and\\r\\nthree fell, as late as yesterday. That is war. We stake our lives every\\r\\nmoment, have we not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves freely? We\\r\\nare Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere. Our\\r\\nfathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to brighten\\r\\nourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like soldiers; you\\r\\nunderstand me, I hope. Are we wrong?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He replied quickly: \\'You are quite right, my friend, and I accept your\\r\\ninvitation with great pleasure.\\' Then he called out: \\'Hermance!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An old bent, wrinkled, horrible, peasant woman appeared and said: \\'What\\r\\ndo you want?\\' \\'I shall not dine at home, my daughter.\\' \\'Where are you\\r\\ngoing to dine then?\\' \\'With some gentlemen, hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt inclined to say: \\'Bring your servant with you, just to see\\r\\nMarchas\\'s face,\\' but I did not venture to, but continued: \\'Do you know\\r\\nanyone among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite as\\r\\nwell?\\' He hesitated, reflected, and then said: \\'No, I do not know\\r\\nanybody!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I persisted: \\'Nobody! Come, Monsieur, think; It would be very nice to\\r\\nhave some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing\\r\\nabout your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the ... the\\r\\n... the ... watchmaker ... the ... shoemaker ... the ... the chemist\\r\\nwith Mrs. chemist.... We have a good spread, and plenty of wine, and we\\r\\nshould be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves behind\\r\\nus, with the people here.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest thought again for a long time, and then resolutely: \\'No,\\r\\nthere is nobody.\\' I began to laugh. \\'By Jove, Monsieur le Curé, it is\\r\\nvery vexing not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come,\\r\\nthink. Is there not a married Mayor, or a married Deputy-Mayor, or a\\r\\nmarried Municipal Concilor or schoolmaster?\\' \\'No, all the ladies have\\r\\ngone away.\\' \\'What, is there not in the whole place some good tradesman\\'s\\r\\nwife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this pleasure, for\\r\\nit would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure under present\\r\\ncircumstances?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suddenly the Curé began to laugh, and he laughed so violently that\\r\\nhe fairly shook. And exclaimed: \\'Ha! ha! ha! I have got what you want,\\r\\nyes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and enjoy\\r\\nourselves, my children, we will have some fun. How pleased the ladies\\r\\nwill be, I say, how delighted they will be. Ha! ha!... Where are you\\r\\nstaying?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I described the house, and he understood where it was. \\'Very good,\\' he\\r\\nsaid. \\'It belongs to Monsieur Bertin Lavaille. I will be there in half\\r\\nan hour, with four ladies!!!... Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!!!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating; \\'That is\\r\\ncapital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille\\'s house.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. \\'Covers\\r\\nfor how many?\\' Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. \\'Eleven. There are\\r\\nsix of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.\\' He was\\r\\nthunderstruck, and I triumphant, and he repeated: \\'Four ladies! Did you\\r\\nsay, four ladies?\\' \\'I said: four women.\\' \\'Real women?\\' \\'Real women.\\'\\r\\n\\'Well accept my compliments!\\' \\'I will, for I deserve them.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He got out of his armchair, opened the door and I saw a beautiful,\\r\\nwhite tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue\\r\\naprons were setting out the plates and glasses. \\'There are some women\\r\\ncoming!\\' Marchas cried. And three men began to dance and to cheer with\\r\\nall their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an\\r\\nhour, while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house.\\r\\nAt last, however, a knock against the shutters, made us all jump up at\\r\\nthe same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a\\r\\nminute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,\\r\\nwrinkled and timid, and successively saluted the four bewildered hussars\\r\\nwho saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled\\r\\nfloor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other\\r\\none by one, who came in balancing themselves with different movements,\\r\\none canting to the right, while the other canted to the left. And three\\r\\nworthy women showed themselves, limping, dragging their legs behind\\r\\nthem, crippled by illness and deformed through old age, three infirm old\\r\\nwomen, past service, the only three pensioners in the establishment\\r\\nwhich Sister Saint-Benedict managed, who were able to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and\\r\\nthen seeing my quarter-master\\'s stripes, she said to me: \\'I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little\\r\\npleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat\\r\\nand doing them a great honor.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw the priest, who had remained in the obscurity of the passage, and\\r\\nwho was laughing heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially\\r\\nwhen I saw Marchas\\'s face. Then motioning the nun to the seats I said:\\r\\n\\'Sit down, Sister: we are very proud and very happy that you have\\r\\naccepted our unpretentious invitation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the\\r\\nfire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their\\r\\nsticks and shawls which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the\\r\\nfirst, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently\\r\\nsuffering from the dropsy, she said: \\'This is Mother Paumelle, whose\\r\\nhusband was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa;\\r\\nshe is sixty years old.\\' Then she pointed to another, a tall woman,\\r\\nwhose head trembled unceasingly: \\'This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is\\r\\nsixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a\\r\\nfire, and her right leg was half burnt off.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,\\r\\nstupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions. \\'This is la\\r\\nPutois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bowed to the three women as if I were presented to some Royal\\r\\nHighness, and turning to the priest I said: \\'You are an excellent man\\r\\nMonsieur l\\'Abbé, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious and\\r\\njust then Karl Massouligny cried: \\'Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is on\\r\\nthe table!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,\\r\\nwhose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy\\r\\ntask, for her swollen stomach seemed heavier than a lump of iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stout Ponderel gave her arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her\\r\\ncrutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, la Putois to the\\r\\ndining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as we were opposite our plates, the Sister clapped her hands\\r\\nthree times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the\\r\\nwomen made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly\\r\\nrepeated the _Benedictus_ in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls\\r\\nappeared, brought in by Marchas, who chose to wait on them, as to sit\\r\\ndown as a guest, to this ridiculous repast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I cried: \\'Bring the champagne at once!\\' and a cork flew out with\\r\\nthe noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the priest and\\r\\nthe kind Sister, the three hussars sitting by the side of the three\\r\\ninvalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats, by force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and\\r\\non being on good terms with everyone, wherever he was, made love to\\r\\nMother Paumelle, in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had\\r\\nretained her cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him\\r\\nbanteringly in a high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put\\r\\non, and she laughed so heartily at her neighbor\\'s jokes, that her large\\r\\nstomach looked as if it were going to rise up and get onto the table.\\r\\nLittle Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot\\r\\ndrunk, and Baron d\\'Etreillis whose wits were not always particularly\\r\\nsharp, was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the\\r\\nrules in the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The nun said to Massouligny in consternation: \\'Oh! oh! you will make\\r\\nher ill; pray do not make her laugh like that, Monsieur. Oh!\\r\\nMonsieur....\\' Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take a full glass\\r\\nout of his hands which he was hastily emptying down la Putois\\' throat,\\r\\nwhile the priest shook with laughter, and said to the Sister: \\'Never\\r\\nmind, just this once, it will not hurt her. Do leave them alone.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three\\r\\npigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,\\r\\ngolden-colored, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned fat meat. La\\r\\nPaumelle who was getting lively, clapped her hands; la Jean-Jean left\\r\\noff answering the Baron\\'s numerous questions, and la Putois uttered\\r\\ngrunts of pleasure, half cries and half sighs, like little children do\\r\\nwhen one shows them sweets. \\'Allow me to take charge of this animal,\\'\\r\\nthe _Curé_ said. \\'I understand these sort of operations better than most\\r\\npeople.\\' \\'Certainly, Monsieur l\\'Abbé,\\' and the Sister said: \\'How would\\r\\nit be to open the window a little; they are too warm, and I am afraid\\r\\nthey will be ill.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I turned to Marchas: \\'Open the window for a minute.\\' He did so, the\\r\\ncold outer air as it came in, made the candles flare, and the smoke\\r\\nfrom the goose, which the _Curé_ was scientifically carving, with a\\r\\ntable napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it,\\r\\nwithout speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive\\r\\nhandiwork, and seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that\\r\\nenormous golden-colored bird, whose limbs fell one after another into\\r\\nthe brown gravy at the bottom of the dish. And at that moment, in the\\r\\nmidst of that greedy silence which kept us all attentive, the distant\\r\\nreport of a shot came in at the open window.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started to my feet so quickly, that my chair fell down behind me, and\\r\\nI shouted: \\'Mount, all of you! You, Marchas, will take two men and go\\r\\nand see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.\\' And\\r\\nwhile the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I got\\r\\ninto the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps\\r\\nof the villa, while the _Curé_, the Sister and the three old women\\r\\nshowed their frightened faces at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The\\r\\nrain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop\\r\\nof a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called\\r\\nout to him: \\'Well?\\' \\'It is nothing; François has wounded an old peasant\\r\\nwho refused to answer his challenge: \"Who goes there?\" and who continued\\r\\nto advance, in spite of the order to keep off; but they are bringing him\\r\\nhere, and we shall see what is the matter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I gave orders for the horses to be put back into the stable, and I sent\\r\\nmy two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the\\r\\n_Curé_, Marchas and I took a mattress into the room to put the wounded\\r\\nman on; the Sister tore up a table napkin, in order to make lint, while\\r\\nthe three frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to\\r\\nshow a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared,\\r\\ncarrying that inert, soft, long and sinister object which a human body\\r\\nbecomes when life no longer sustains it.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for\\r\\nhim, and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death\\r\\nrattle and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his\\r\\nmouth, forced out of his mouth by his gasps. The man was covered with\\r\\nit! His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to\\r\\nhave been rubbed, to have been dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck\\r\\nto him, and had become a dull color, which was horrible to look at.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old man, wrapped up in a large shepherd\\'s cloak, occasionally\\r\\nopened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment,\\r\\nlike those of animals which a sportsman kills, and which fall at his\\r\\nfeet, more than half dead already, stupefied with fear and astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ exclaimed: \\'Ah! there is old Placide, the shepherd, from les\\r\\nMarlins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh God! they have\\r\\nkilled the unhappy man!\\' The Sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and\\r\\nwas looking at a little blue hole in the middle of his chest, which was\\r\\nnot bleeding any more. \\'There is nothing to be done,\\' she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last\\r\\nbreath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could\\r\\nhear an ominous and continued gurgling. The Curé, standing in front of\\r\\nhim, raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow\\r\\nand solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men\\'s souls,\\r\\nbut before they were finished the old man was shaken by a rapid shock,\\r\\nas if something had broken inside him; he no longer breathed. He was\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than\\r\\nthe death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were\\r\\nstanding up huddled close together; hideous, and grimacing with fear and\\r\\nhorror. I went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while\\r\\nla Jean-Jean, whose leg had been burnt, and could not longer support\\r\\nher, fell to the ground at full length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old\\r\\nwomen, and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round\\r\\nthem, gave them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go\\r\\nout, and disappeared with them into the dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere\\r\\nrattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ was still looking at the dead man; but at last he turned\\r\\nround to me and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh! What a horrible thing!\\'\"',\n"," 'IN THE WOOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was just going to sit down to breakfast, when he was told that\\r\\nthe rural policeman was waiting for him at the Mansion-house with two\\r\\nprisoners, and he went there immediately, and found old Hochedur\\r\\nstanding up and watching a middle-class couple of mature years, with a\\r\\nsevere look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, a fat old fellow with a red nose and white hair, seemed utterly\\r\\ndejected; while the woman, a little roundabout, fat woman, with shining\\r\\ncheeks, looked at the agent of the authorities who had arrested them,\\r\\nwith defiant eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it? What is it? Hochedur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rural policeman made his deposition: He had gone out that morning at\\r\\nhis usual time, in order to go on his beat from the forest of Champioux\\r\\nas far as the boundaries of Argenteuil. He had not noticed anything\\r\\nunusual in the country except that it was a fine day, and that the wheat\\r\\nwas doing well, when the son of old Bredel, who was going over his vines\\r\\na second time, called out to him: \"Here, Daddy Hochedur, go and have a\\r\\nlook into the skirts of the wood, in the first thicket, and you will\\r\\ncatch a pair of pigeons there that must be a hundred and thirty years\\r\\nold between them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went in the direction that had been indicated to him, and had gone\\r\\ninto the thicket, and there he heard words and gasps, which made him\\r\\nsuspect a flagrant breach of morality. Advancing, therefore, on his\\r\\nhands and knees, as if to surprise a poacher, he had arrested the couple\\r\\nwho were there present, at the very moment when they were going to\\r\\nabandon themselves to their natural instincts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor looked at the culprits in astonishment, for the man was\\r\\ncertainly sixty, and the woman fifty-five at least, and so he began to\\r\\nquestion them, beginning with the man, who replied in such a weak voice\\r\\nthat he could scarcely be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\" \"Nicolas Beaurain.\" \"Your occupation?\"\\r\\n\"Haberdasher, in the Rue des Martyrs, in Paris.\" \"What were you doing in\\r\\nthe wood?\" The haberdasher remained silent, with his eyes on his fat\\r\\nstomach; and his hand resting on his thighs, and the Mayor continued:\\r\\n\"Do you deny what the officer of the municipal authorities states?\" \"No,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"So you confess it?\" \"Yes, Monsieur.\" \"What have you to say\\r\\nin your defense?\" \"Nothing, Monsieur.\" \"Where did you meet the partner\\r\\nin your misdemeanor?\" \"She is my wife, Monsieur.\" \"Your wife?\" \"Yes,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"Then ... then ... you do not live together ... in Paris?\" \"I\\r\\nbeg your pardon, Monsieur, but we are living together!\" \"But in that\\r\\ncase ... you must be mad, altogether mad, my dear sir, to get caught\\r\\nlike that, in the country at ten o\\'clock in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe haberdasher seemed ready to cry with shame, and he murmured: \"It was\\r\\nshe who enticed me! I told her it was very stupid, but when a woman has\\r\\ngot a thing into her head ... you know ... you cannot get it out of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor, who liked open speaking, smiled and replied: \"In your case,\\r\\nthe contrary ought to have happened. You would not be here, if she had\\r\\nhad the idea only in her head!\" Then Monsieur Beaurain was seized with\\r\\nrage, and turning to his wife, he said: \"Do you see to what you have\\r\\nbrought us with your poetry? And now we shall have to go before the\\r\\nCourts, at our age, for a breach of morals! And we shall have to shut up\\r\\nthe shop, sell our good will and go to some other neighborhood! That\\'s\\r\\nwhat it has come to!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Beaurain got up, and without looking at her husband, she\\r\\nexplained herself without any embarrassment, without useless modesty,\\r\\nand almost without hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, Monsieur, I know that we have made ourselves ridiculous.\\r\\nWill you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate; or rather like a\\r\\npoor woman; and I hope that you will be kind enough to send us home, and\\r\\nto spare us the disgrace of a prosecution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Years ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain\\'s acquaintance on\\r\\nSunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a draper\\'s shop, and I\\r\\nwas a young lady in a ready made clothing establishment. I remember it,\\r\\nas if it were yesterday. I used to come and spend Sundays here\\r\\noccasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Levéque, with whom I lived in\\r\\nthe Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had not. He used to\\r\\nbring us here, and one Saturday, he told me, laughing, that he should\\r\\nbring a friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he meant,\\r\\nbut I replied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous, Monsieur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and in\\r\\nthose days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to yield\\r\\nto him, and I did not yield. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a lovely\\r\\nday, the sort of day that tickles your heart. When it is fine, even now,\\r\\njust as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when I am in\\r\\nthe country I utterly lose my head. The verdure, the swallows flying so\\r\\nswiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies, the daisies, all\\r\\nthat makes me quite excited! It is like champagne when one is not used\\r\\nto it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to\\r\\npenetrate into your body by your eyes when you looked, and by your mouth\\r\\nwhen you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other every\\r\\nminute, and that gave me something to look at! Monsieur Beaurain and I\\r\\nwalked behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know\\r\\neach other they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid, and\\r\\nI liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood; it\\r\\nwas as cool as in a bath there, and we all four sat down. Rose and her\\r\\nlover joked me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand\\r\\nthat could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug again,\\r\\nwithout putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had not\\r\\nbeen there; and then they whispered together, and then got up and went\\r\\noff among the trees, without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked\\r\\nlike, alone with this young fellow, whom I saw for the first time. I\\r\\nfelt so confused at seeing them go that it gave me courage and I began\\r\\nto talk. I asked him what his business was, and he said he was a linen\\r\\ndraper\\'s assistant, as I told you just now. We talked for a few minutes\\r\\nand that made him bold, and he wanted to take liberties with me, but I\\r\\ntold him sharply to keep his own place. Is not that true, Monsieur\\r\\nBeaurain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Beaurain, who was looking at his feet in confusion, did not\\r\\nreply, and she continued: \"Then he saw that I was virtuous, and he began\\r\\nto make love to me nicely, like an honorable man, and from that time he\\r\\ncame every Sunday, for he was very much in love with me. I was very fond\\r\\nof him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow, formerly,\\r\\nand in short he married me the next September, and we started in\\r\\nbusiness in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a hard struggle for some years, Monsieur. Business did not\\r\\nprosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and then we\\r\\nhad grown unaccustomed to them. One has other things in one\\'s head, and\\r\\nthinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in\\r\\nbusiness. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like\\r\\nquiet people who do not think much about love. One does not regret\\r\\nanything as long as one does not notice what one has lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And after that, Monsieur, business went better, and we became tranquil\\r\\nas to the future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what passed\\r\\nwithin me, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little\\r\\nboarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers\\r\\nwhich are drawn about the streets, made me cry; the smell of violets\\r\\nsought me out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart\\r\\nbeat! Then I used to get up and go onto the doorstep to look at the\\r\\nblue sky between the roofs. When one looks at the sky from a street, it\\r\\nlooks like a river which descends on Paris, winding as it flows, and the\\r\\nswallows pass to and fro in it like fish. This sort of things is very\\r\\nstupid at my age! But what can one do, Monsieur? when one has worked all\\r\\none\\'s life? A moment comes in which one perceives that one could have\\r\\ndone something else, and then, one regrets, oh! yes, one feels great\\r\\nregret! Just think that for twenty years I might have gone and had\\r\\nkisses in the woods, like other women. I used to think how delightful it\\r\\nwould be to lie under the trees, loving some one! And I thought of it\\r\\neveryday and every night! I dreamt of the moonlight on the water, until\\r\\nI felt inclined to drown myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not venture to speak to Monsieur Beaurain about this at first. I\\r\\nknew that he would make fun of me, and send me back to sell my needles\\r\\nand cotton! And then, to speak the truth, Monsieur Beaurain never said\\r\\nmuch to me, but when I looked in the glass, I also understood quite\\r\\nwell, that I also no longer appealed to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I made up my mind, and I proposed an excursion into the country\\r\\nto him, to the place where we had first become acquainted. He agreed\\r\\nwithout any distrust, and we arrived here this morning, about nine\\r\\no\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt quite young again when I got among the corn, for a woman\\'s heart\\r\\nnever grows old! And really, I no longer saw my husband as he is at\\r\\npresent, but just like he was formerly! That I will swear to you,\\r\\nMonsieur. As true as I am standing here, I was intoxicated. I began to\\r\\nkiss him, and he was more surprised than if I had tried to murder him.\\r\\nHe kept saying to me: \\'Why, you must be mad! You are mad this morning!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with you?...\\' I did not listen to him, I only\\r\\nlistened to my own heart, and I made him come into the woods with me....\\r\\nThere it is.... I have spoken the truth, Monsieur le Maire, the whole\\r\\ntruth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was a sensible man. He rose from his chair, smiled, and said:\\r\\n\"Go in peace, Madame, and sin no more ... under the trees.\"',\n"," 'A FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to see my friend Simon Radevin once more, whom I had not had\\r\\na sight of for fifteen years. Formerly he used to be my most intimate\\r\\nfriend, and I used to spend long, quiet and happy evenings with him; he\\r\\nwas one of those men to whom one tells one\\'s most intimate affairs of\\r\\nthe heart, for whom one finds, when conversing tranquilly, rare, clever,\\r\\ningenious and refined thoughts, which excite the mind and put it at its\\r\\nease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, traveled,\\r\\nthought and dreamt together; had liked the same things with the same\\r\\nliking, had admired the same books, comprehended the same works,\\r\\nshivered with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same\\r\\nindividuals, whom we understood completely, by merely exchanging a\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he married; quite unexpectedly he married a little girl from the\\r\\nprovinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How ever could\\r\\nthat little, thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light,\\r\\nvacant eyes, and her clear silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred\\r\\nthousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever\\r\\nyoung fellow? Can anyone understand these things? No doubt he had hoped\\r\\nfor happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of\\r\\na good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the\\r\\ntransparent looks of that school girl with light hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not dreamt of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man\\r\\ngrows tired as soon as he has comprehended the stupid reality, unless\\r\\nindeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing more\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light\\r\\nhearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor through\\r\\nprovincial life? A man can change a great deal in the course of fifteen\\r\\nyears!\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage,\\r\\na stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to\\r\\nme with open arms, exclaiming: \"George!\" I embraced him, but I had not\\r\\nrecognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \"By Jove! You have not\\r\\ngrown thin!\" And he replied with a laugh: \"What did you expect? Good\\r\\nliving, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my\\r\\nexistence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him closely, trying to find the features I held so dear in\\r\\nthat broad face. His eyes alone had not altered, but I no longer saw the\\r\\nsame looks in them, and I said to myself: \"If the looks be the\\r\\nreflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used\\r\\nto be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of pleasure and friendship, but they had\\r\\nnot that clear, intelligent expression, which expresses as much as words\\r\\ndo, the value of the mind. Suddenly he said to me: \"Here are my two\\r\\neldest children.\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy\\r\\nof thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a _Lycée_, came forward in a\\r\\nhesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \"Are they\\r\\nyours?\" \"Of course they are,\" he replied laughing. \"How many have you?\"\\r\\n\"Five! There are three more indoors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I\\r\\nfelt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt for this\\r\\nvainglorious and simple reproducer of his species, who spent his nights\\r\\nin his country house in making children.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got into a carriage, which he drove himself, and we set off through\\r\\nthe town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town, where nothing was moving in the\\r\\nstreets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there\\r\\na shopkeeper standing at his door took off his hat, and Simon returned\\r\\nhis salute and told me the man\\'s name; no doubt to show me that he knew\\r\\nall the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was\\r\\nthinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream\\r\\nof all who have buried themselves in the provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden,\\r\\nwhich had some pretensions to being a park, and stopped in front of a\\r\\nturretted house, which tried to pass for a château.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is my den,\" Simon said, so that he might be complimented on it,\\r\\nand I replied that it was delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed up for a visitor, her hair done\\r\\nfor a visitor, and with phrases ready prepared for a visitor. She was no\\r\\nlonger the light haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years\\r\\npreviously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies\\r\\nwithout any fixed age, without intellect, without any of those things\\r\\nwhich constitute a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout,\\r\\ncommonplace mother, the human layer and brood mare, that machine of\\r\\nflesh which procreates without any other mental preoccupation, except\\r\\nher children and her housekeeping book.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged\\r\\naccording to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen\\r\\nbefore a mayor, and I said: \"Ah! ah! so these are the others?\" And\\r\\nSimon, who was radiant with pleasure, named them: \"Jean, Sophie and\\r\\nGontran.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in and in the depths of an\\r\\neasy-chair I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man.\\r\\nMadame Radevin came forward and said: \"This is my grandfather,\\r\\nMonsieur; he is eighty-seven.\" And then she shouted into the shaking old\\r\\nman\\'s ears: \"This is a friend of Simon\\'s, papa.\" The old gentleman tried\\r\\nto say \"good day\" to me, and he muttered: \"Oua, oua, oua,\" and waved his\\r\\nhand, and I took a seat, saying: \"You are very kind, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \"So! You have made\\r\\ngrandpapa\\'s acquaintance. He is priceless, is that old man; he is the\\r\\ndelight of the children, and he is so greedy that he almost kills\\r\\nhimself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were\\r\\nallowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He likes\\r\\nall the sweets as if they were so many girls. You have never seen\\r\\nanything funnier; you will see it presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was then shown to my room to change my dress for dinner, and hearing\\r\\na great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all\\r\\nthe children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy windows looked out onto a plain, bare, interminable plain, an ocean\\r\\nof grass, of wheat, and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising\\r\\nground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be\\r\\nleading in that house.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and so I went downstairs. Madame Radevin\\r\\ntook my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we went into the dining-room. A\\r\\nfootman wheeled in the old man\\'s armchair, who gave a greedy and curious\\r\\nlook at the dessert, as he with difficulty turned his shaking head from\\r\\none dish to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \"You will be amused,\" he said; and all the\\r\\nchildren understood that I was going to be indulged with the sight of\\r\\ntheir greedy grandfather, and they began to laugh accordingly, while\\r\\ntheir mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making\\r\\na speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \"This evening\\r\\nthere is sweet rice cream,\" and the wrinkled face of the grandfather\\r\\nbrightened, and he trembled more violently all over, showing that he had\\r\\nunderstood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look!\" Simon whispered. The grandfather did not like the soup, and\\r\\nhe refused to eat it; but he was made to, on account of his health, and\\r\\nthe footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew\\r\\nenergetically, so as not to swallow the soup, which was thus scattered\\r\\nlike a stream of water onto the table and over his neighbors. The\\r\\nchildren shook with delight at the spectacle, while their father, who\\r\\nwas also amused, said: \"Is not the old man funny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole meal, they were all taken up solely with him. He\\r\\ndevoured the dishes which were put on the table, with his eyes, and he\\r\\ntried to seize them and pull them to himself with his trembling hands.\\r\\nThey put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his\\r\\ntrembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of\\r\\nhis eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he\\r\\nslobbered onto his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering\\r\\ninarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this\\r\\nhorrible and grotesque scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they put a tiny morsel onto his plate, which he ate with feverish\\r\\ngluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when\\r\\nthe rice-cream was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with\\r\\ngreediness, and Gontran called out to him: \"You have eaten too much\\r\\nalready; you will have no more.\" And they pretended not to give him any.\\r\\nThen he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever,\\r\\nwhile all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his\\r\\nhelping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful of the\\r\\npudding, he made a comical and greedy noise in his throat, and a\\r\\nmovement with his neck like ducks do when they swallow too large a\\r\\nmorsel, and then, when he had done, he began to stamp his feet, so as to\\r\\nget more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and I\\r\\ninterposed on his behalf: \"Please, will you not give him a little more\\r\\nrice?\" But Simon replied: \"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat\\r\\ntoo much, it might harm him, at his age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI held my tongue, and thought over these words. Oh! ethics! Oh! logic!\\r\\nOh! wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining\\r\\npleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with\\r\\nit, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his\\r\\nlife, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a\\r\\nhundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the\\r\\nspectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He\\r\\nhad one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last\\r\\nsolace constantly, until he died?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I\\r\\nwas low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! I sat at my window, but I heard\\r\\nnothing but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the\\r\\ndistance. No doubt the bird was singing thus in a low voice during the\\r\\nnight, and to lull his mate, who was sleeping on her eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I thought of my poor friend\\'s five children, and pictured him to\\r\\nmyself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.',\n"," 'JOSEPH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both of them drunk, quite drunk, little Baroness Andrée de la\\r\\nFraisières and little Countess Noemi de Gardens. They had been dining\\r\\nalone together, in the large room which faced the sea. The soft breeze\\r\\nof a summer evening blew in at the open window, soft and fresh at the\\r\\nsame time, a breeze that smelt of the sea. The two young women, extended\\r\\nin their lounging chairs, sipped their Chartreuse from time to time, as\\r\\nthey smoked their cigarettes, and they were talking most confidentially,\\r\\ntelling each other details which nothing but this charming intoxication\\r\\ncould have induced their pretty lips to utter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir husbands had returned to Paris that afternoon, and had left them\\r\\nalone on that little deserted beach, which they had chosen so as to\\r\\navoid those gallant marauders who are constantly met with in fashionable\\r\\nwatering places. As they were absent for five days in the week, they\\r\\nobjected to country excursions, luncheons on the grass, swimming lessons\\r\\nand those sudden familiarities which spring up in the idle life of\\r\\nwatering places. Dieppe, Etratat, Trouville seemed to them to be places\\r\\nto be avoided, and they had rented a house which had been built and\\r\\nabandoned by an eccentric individual in the valley of Roqueville, near\\r\\nFécamp, and there they buried their wives for the whole summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were drunk. Not knowing what to hit upon to amuse themselves, the\\r\\nlittle Baroness had suggested a good dinner and champagne. To begin\\r\\nwith, they had found great amusement in cooking this dinner themselves,\\r\\nand then they had eaten it merrily, and had drunk freely, in order to\\r\\nallay the thirst which the heat of the fire had excited. Now they were\\r\\nchatting and talking nonsense, while gently gargling their throats with\\r\\nChartreuse. In fact they did not in the least know any longer what they\\r\\nwere saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess, with her legs in the air on the back of a chair, was\\r\\nfurther gone than her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To complete an evening like this,\" she said, \"we ought to have a lover\\r\\napiece. If I had foreseen this some time ago, I would have sent for a\\r\\ncouple from Paris, and I would have let you have one....\" \"I can always\\r\\nfind one,\" the other replied; \"I could have one this very evening, if I\\r\\nwished.\" \"What nonsense! At Roqueville, my dear? It would have to be\\r\\nsome peasant, then.\" \"No, not altogether.\" \"Well, tell me all about it.\"\\r\\n\"What do you want me to tell you?\" \"About your lover.\" \"My dear, I do\\r\\nnot want to live without being loved, for I should fancy I was dead if I\\r\\nwere not loved.\" \"So should I.\" \"Is not that so?\" \"Yes. Men cannot\\r\\nunderstand it! And especially our husbands!\" \"No, not in the least. How\\r\\ncan you expect it to be different? The love which we want is made up of\\r\\nbeing spoilt, of gallantries and of pretty words and actions. That is\\r\\nthe nourishment of our hearts; it is indispensable to our life,\\r\\nindispensable, indispensable....\" \"Indispensable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must feel that somebody is thinking of me, always, everywhere. When I\\r\\ngo to sleep and when I wake up, I must know that somebody loves me\\r\\nsomewhere, that I am being dreamt of, longed for. Without that, I should\\r\\nbe wretched, wretched! Oh! yes, unhappy enough to do nothing but cry.\"\\r\\n\"I am just the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember that anything else is impossible. When a husband has\\r\\nbeen nice for six months, or a year, or two years, he necessarily\\r\\nbecomes a brute, yes, a regular brute.... He does not put himself out\\r\\nfor anything, but shows himself just as he is, and makes a scene on the\\r\\nslightest provocation, or without any provocation whatever. One cannot\\r\\nlove a man with whom one lives constantly.\" \"That is quite true.\" \"Isn\\'t\\r\\nit?... What was I saying? I cannot the least remember?\" \"You were saying\\r\\nthat all husbands are brutes!\" \"Yes, brutes ... all of them.\" \"That is\\r\\nquite true.\" \"And then?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What was I saying just\\r\\nthen?\" \"I don\\'t know because you did not say it!\" \"But I had something\\r\\nto tell you.\" \"Oh! yes, that is true; well?...\" \"Oh! I have got it....\"\\r\\n\"Well, I am listening.\" \"I was telling you that I can find lovers\\r\\neverywhere.\" \"How do you manage it?\" \"Like this. Now follow me\\r\\ncarefully. When I get to some fresh place, I take notes and make my\\r\\nchoice.\" \"You make your choice?\" \"Yes, of course I do. First of all, I\\r\\ntake notes. I ask questions. Above all, a man must be discreet, rich and\\r\\ngenerous; is not that so?\" \"It is quite true!\" \"And then he must please\\r\\nme, as a man.\" \"Of course.\" \"Then I bait the hook for him.\" \"You bait\\r\\nthe hook?\" \"Yes, just as one does to catch fish. Have you never fished\\r\\nwith a hook and line?\" \"No, never.\" \"You are wrong; It is very amusing,\\r\\nand besides that, it is instructive. Well then, I bait the hook....\"\\r\\n\"How do you do it?\" \"How stupid you are. Does not one catch the man one\\r\\nwants to catch, without their having any choice? And they really think\\r\\nthat they choose ... the fools ... but it is we who choose ...\\r\\nalways.... Just think, when one is not ugly, nor stupid, as is the case\\r\\nwith us, all men aspire to us, all ... without exception. We look them\\r\\nover from morning till night, and when we have selected one, we fish for\\r\\nhim....\" \"But that does not tell me how you do it?\" \"How I do it?...\\r\\nWhy, I do nothing; I allow myself to be looked at, that is all.\" \"You\\r\\nallow yourself to be looked at?...\" \"Why yes; that is quite enough. When\\r\\none has allowed oneself to be looked at several times following, a man\\r\\nimmediately thinks you the most lovely, most seductive of women, and\\r\\nthen he begins to make love to you. I give him to understand that he is\\r\\nnot so bad looking, without saying anything to him, of course, and he\\r\\nfalls in love, like a dog. I have him fast, and it lasts a longer or a\\r\\nshorter time, according to his qualities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you catch all whom you please, like that?\" \"Nearly all.\" \"Oh! So\\r\\nthere are some who resist?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Why?\" \"Oh! Why? A man is a\\r\\nJoseph for three reasons. Because he is in love with another woman.\\r\\nBecause he is excessively timid, or because he is ... how shall I say\\r\\nit? ... incapable of carrying out the conquest of a woman to the\\r\\nend....\" \"Oh! my dear!... Do you really believe?...\" \"I am sure of\\r\\nit.... There are many of this latter class, many, many ... many more\\r\\nthan people think. Oh! they look just like everybody else ... they strut\\r\\nlike peacocks.... No, when I said peacocks ... I made a mistake, for\\r\\nthey could not display themselves.\" \"Oh! my dear....\" \"As to the timid,\\r\\nthey are sometimes unspeakably stupid. They are the sort of men, who\\r\\nought not to undress themselves, even when they are going to bed alone,\\r\\nwhen there is a looking-glass in their room. With them, one must be\\r\\nenergetic, make use of looks, and squeeze their hands, and even that is\\r\\nuseless sometimes. They never know how or where to begin. When one\\r\\nfaints in their presence ... as a last resource ... they try to bring\\r\\nyou round ... and if you do not recover your senses immediately ... they\\r\\ngo and get assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those whom I prefer myself, are other women\\'s lovers. I carry them by\\r\\nassault ... at ... at ... at the point of the bayonet, my dear!\" \"That\\r\\nis all very well, but when there are no men, like here, for instance?\"\\r\\n\"I find them!\" \"You find them. But where?\" \"Everywhere. But that reminds\\r\\nme of my story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now listen. Just two years ago, my husband made me pass the summer on\\r\\nhis estate at Bougrolles. There was nothing there ... you know what I\\r\\nmean, nothing, nothing, nothing, whatever! In the neighboring country\\r\\nhouses there were a few disgusting boors, who cared for nothing but\\r\\nshooting, and who lived in country houses which had not even a bathroom,\\r\\nmen who perspire, go to bed covered with perspiration, and whom it would\\r\\nbe impossible to improve, because their principles of life are dirty.\\r\\nNow just guess what I did!\" \"I cannot possibly.\" \"Ha! ha! ha! I had\\r\\njust been reading a number of George Sand\\'s novels which exalt the man\\r\\nof the people, novels in which the workmen are sublime, and all the men\\r\\nof the world are criminals. In addition to this I had seen Ruy Blas the\\r\\nwinter before, and it had struck me very much. Well, one of our farmers\\r\\nhad a son, a good-looking young fellow of two and twenty who had studied\\r\\nfor a priest, but had left the seminary in disgust. Well, I took him as\\r\\nfootman!\" \"Oh!... And then?... What afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then ... then, my dear, I treated him very haughtily, and showed him a\\r\\ngood deal of my person. I did not entice this rustic on, I simply\\r\\ninflamed him!...\" \"Oh! Andrée!\" \"Yes, and I enjoyed the fun very much.\\r\\nPeople say that servants count for nothing! Well he did not count for\\r\\nmuch. I used to ring to give him his orders every morning while my maid\\r\\nwas dressing me, and every evening as well, while she was undressing\\r\\nme.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear he caught fire like a thatched roof. Then, at meals, I used\\r\\ncontinually to talk about cleanliness, about taking care of one\\'s\\r\\nperson, about baths and shower baths, until at the end of a fortnight he\\r\\nbathed in the river morning and night, and used to scent himself enough\\r\\nto poison the whole château. I was even obliged to forbid him to use\\r\\nperfumes, telling him, with furious looks, that men ought never to use\\r\\nscent except Eau de Cologne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, I took it into my head to get together a library suitable to the\\r\\ncountry. I sent for a few hundred moral novels, which I lent to all our\\r\\npeasants, and all my servants. A few books ... a few ... poetical books\\r\\n... such as excite the mind of ... schoolboys and schoolgirls ... had\\r\\nfound their way into my collection ... and I gave them to my footman.\\r\\nThat taught him life ... a funny sort of life.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I grew familiar with him, and used to say thou[18] to him. I had\\r\\ngiven him the name of Joseph. And, my dear, he was in a state ... in a\\r\\nterrible state.... He got as thin as ... as a barn-door cock ... and\\r\\nrolled his eyes like an idiot. I was extremely amused; it was one of the\\r\\nmost delightful summers I ever spent....\" \"And then?...\" \"Then?... Oh!\\r\\nyes.... Well, one day when my husband was away from home, I told him to\\r\\norder the basket carriage and to drive me into the woods. It was warm,\\r\\nvery warm.... There!\" \"Oh Andrée, do tell me all about it.... It is so\\r\\namusing....\" \"Here have a glass of Chartreuse, otherwise I shall empty\\r\\nthe decanter myself. Well, I felt ill, on the road.\" \"How?\" \"You are\\r\\nvery stupid. I told him that I was not feeling well, and that he must\\r\\nlay me on the grass, and when I was lying there, I told him I was\\r\\nchoking, and that he must unlace me. And then, when I was unlaced, I\\r\\nfainted.\" \"Did you go right off?\" \"Oh! dear no, not the least.\" \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I was obliged to remain unconscious for nearly an hour, as he\\r\\ncould find no means of bringing me round. But I was very patient, and\\r\\ndid not open my eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!... And what did you say to him?\" \"I? Nothing at all! How\\r\\nwas I to know anything, as I was unconscious? I thanked him, and told\\r\\nhim to help me into the carriage, and he drove me back to the Château;\\r\\nbut he nearly upset us in turning into the gate!\" \"Oh! Andrée! And is\\r\\nthat all?...\" \"That is all....\" \"You did not faint more than that once?\"\\r\\n\"Only once, of course! I did not want to take such a fellow for my\\r\\nlover.\" \"Did you keep him long after that?\" \"Yes, of course. I have him\\r\\nstill. Why should I have sent him away? I had nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée! And is he in love with you still?\" \"Of course he is.\"\\r\\n\"Where is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness put out her hand to the wall and touched the\\r\\nelectric bell, and the door opened almost immediately, and a tall\\r\\nfootman came in who diffused a scent of Eau de Cologne all round him.\\r\\n\"Joseph,\" she said to him, \"I am afraid I am going to faint; send my\\r\\nlady\\'s maid to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood motionless, like a soldier before his officer, and fixed\\r\\nan ardent look on his mistress, who continued: \"Go quickly, you great\\r\\nidiot, we are not in the wood to-day, and Rosalie will attend to me\\r\\nbetter than you would.\" He turned on his heels and went, and the little\\r\\nBaroness asked nervously: \"But what shall you say to your maid?\" \"I\\r\\nshall tell her what we have been doing! No, I shall merely get her to\\r\\nunlace me; it will relieve my chest, for I can scarcely breathe. I am\\r\\ndrunk ... my dear ... so drunk that I should fall, if I were to get up\\r\\nfrom my chair.\"',\n"," 'THE INN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all the wooden inns in the higher Alps, which are situated in the\\r\\nrocky and bare gorges which intersect the white summits of the\\r\\nmountains, the inn of Schwarenbach stands as a refuge for travelers who\\r\\nare crossing the Gemmi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remains open for six months in the year, and is inhabited by the\\r\\nfamily of Jean Hauser; then, as soon as the snow begins to fall, and\\r\\nfills the valley so as to make the road down to Loëche impassable, the\\r\\nfather and his three sons go away, and leave the house in charge of the\\r\\nold guide, Gaspard Hari, with the young guide, Ulrich Kunzi, and Sam,\\r\\nthe great mountain dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men and the dog remained till the spring in their snowy prison,\\r\\nwith nothing before their eyes except the immense, white slopes of the\\r\\nBalmhorn; they were surrounded by light, glistening summits, and shut\\r\\nup, blocked up and buried by the snow which rose around them, and which\\r\\nenveloped, bound and crushed the little house, which lay piled on the\\r\\nroof, reached to the windows and blocked up the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to\\r\\nLoëche, as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming\\r\\ndangerous. Three mules started first, laden with baggage and led by the\\r\\nthree sons. Then the mother, Jean Hauser and her daughter Louise mounted\\r\\na fourth mule, and set off in their turn, and the father followed them,\\r\\naccompanied by the two men in charge, who were to escort the family as\\r\\nfar as the brow of the descent. First of all they passed round the small\\r\\nlake, which was now frozen over, at the bottom of the mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich stretched in front of the inn, and then they followed the valley,\\r\\nwhich was dominated on all sides by the snow covered summits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ray of sunlight fell into that little white, glistening, frozen\\r\\ndesert, and illuminated it with a cold and dazzling flame; no living\\r\\nthing appeared among this ocean of hills; there was nothing more in this\\r\\nimmeasurable solitude, and no noise disturbed the profound silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees the young guide Ulrich Kunzi, a tall, long legged Swiss, left\\r\\ndaddy Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to catch up to the mule,\\r\\nwhich carried the two women. The younger one looked at him as he\\r\\napproached, and appeared to be calling him, with her sad eyes. She was a\\r\\nyoung, light haired peasant girl, whose milk white cheeks and pale hair\\r\\nlooked as if they had lost their color by their long abode amidst the\\r\\nice. When he had got up with the animal which carried them, he put his\\r\\nhand on the crupper, and relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk\\r\\nto him, and enumerated with the minutest details all that he would have\\r\\nto attend to during the winter. It was the first time that he was going\\r\\nto stop up there, while old Hari had already spent fourteen winters\\r\\namidst the snow, at the inn of Schwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened, without appearing to understand, and looked\\r\\nincessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied: \"Yes, Madame\\r\\nHauser;\" but his thoughts seemed far away, and his calm features\\r\\nremained unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface extended to the\\r\\nbottom of the valley. On the right, the Daubenhorn showed its black\\r\\nrocks, rising up in a peak above the enormous moraines of the Lömmeon\\r\\nglacier, which rose above the Wildstrubel. As they approached the neck\\r\\nof the Gemmi, where the descent to Loëche begins, they suddenly beheld\\r\\nthe immense horizon of the Alps of the Valais, from which the broad,\\r\\ndeep valley of the Rhone separated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance, there was a group of white, unequal flat or pointed\\r\\nmountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the Mischabel with its two\\r\\npeaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn, the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty\\r\\nand formidable pyramid of Mont Cervin, that slayer of men, and the\\r\\nDent-Blanche, that terrible coquette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, beneath them, in a tremendous hole, at the bottom of a terrible\\r\\nabyss, they perceived Loëche, where houses looked as grains of sand\\r\\nwhich had been thrown in that enormous crevice, which finishes and\\r\\ncloses the Gemmi, and which opens, down below, onto the Rhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mule stopped at the edge of the path, which goes turning and\\r\\ntwisting continually, and which comes back fantastically and strangely,\\r\\nalong the side of the mountain, as far as the almost invisible little\\r\\nvillage at its feet. The women jumped into the snow, and the two old men\\r\\njoined them. \"Well,\" father Hauser said, \"good-bye, and keep up your\\r\\nspirits till next year, my friends,\" and old Hari replied: \"Till next\\r\\nyear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey embraced each other, and then Madame Hauser in her turn, offered\\r\\nher cheek, and the girl did the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulrich Kunzi\\'s turn came, he whispered in Louise\\'s ear: \"Do not\\r\\nforget those up yonder,\" and she replied: \"no,\" in such a low voice,\\r\\nthat he guessed what she had said, without hearing it. \"Well, adieu,\"\\r\\nJean Hauser repeated, \"and don\\'t fall ill.\" And going before the two\\r\\nwomen, he commenced the descent, and soon all three disappeared at the\\r\\nfirst turn in the road, while the two men returned to the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked slowly, side by side, without speaking. It was over, and\\r\\nthey would be alone together for four or five months. Then Gaspard Bari\\r\\nbegan to relate his life last winter. He had remained with Michael\\r\\nCanol, who was too old now to stand it; for an accident might happen\\r\\nduring that long solitude. They had not been dull, however; the only\\r\\nthing was to make up one\\'s mind to it from the first, and in the end one\\r\\nwould find plenty of distraction, games and other means of whiling away\\r\\nthe time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in his\\r\\nthoughts he was following those who were descending to the village. They\\r\\nsoon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so\\r\\nsmall did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of\\r\\nsnow, and when they opened the door, Sam, the great curly dog, began to\\r\\nromp round them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, my boy,\" old Gaspard said, \"we have no women now, so we must get\\r\\nour own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes.\" And they both sat down\\r\\non wooden stools, and began to put the bread into the soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning seemed very long to Kunzi. Old Hari smoked and spat\\r\\nonto the hearth, while the young man looked out of the window at the\\r\\nsnow-covered mountain opposite the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon he went out, and going over yesterday\\'s ground again,\\r\\nhe looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the two women;\\r\\nthen when he had reached the neck of the Gemmi, he laid himself down on\\r\\nhis stomach and looked at Loëche.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow,\\r\\nalthough it came quite close to it, but it was stopped short by the pine\\r\\nwoods which protected it. Its low houses looked like paving stones in a\\r\\nlarge meadow, from up there. Hauser\\'s little daughter was there now, in\\r\\none of those gray colored houses. In which? Ulrich Kunzi was too far\\r\\naway to be able to make them out separately. How he would have liked to\\r\\ngo down, while he was yet able!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the Wildstrubel,\\r\\nand the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari was smoking, and\\r\\nwhen he saw his mate come in, he proposed a game of cards to him, and\\r\\nthey sat down opposite each other, on either side of the table. They\\r\\nplayed for a long time, a simple game called _brisque_, and then they\\r\\nhad supper and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following days were like the first, bright and cold, without any\\r\\nmore snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the eagles and\\r\\nother rare birds which ventured onto those frozen heights, while Ulrich\\r\\nreturned regularly to the neck of the Gemmi to look at the village. Then\\r\\nthey played at cards, dice or dominoes, and lost and won a trifle, just\\r\\nto create an interest in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A moving deep\\r\\nand light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly, and was\\r\\nby degrees burying them under a thick, dark coverlet of foam, and that\\r\\nlasted four days and four nights. It was necessary to free the door and\\r\\nthe windows, to dig out a passage and to cut steps to get over this\\r\\nfrozen powder, which a twelve hours frost had made as hard as the\\r\\ngranite of the moraines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived like prisoners, and did not venture outside their abode. They\\r\\nhad divided their duties, which they performed regularly. Ulrich Kunzi\\r\\nundertook the scouring, washing, and everything that belonged to\\r\\ncleanliness. He also chopped up the wood, while Gaspard Hari did the\\r\\ncooking and attended to the fire. Their regular and monotonous work was\\r\\ninterrupted by long games at cards or dice, and they never quarreled,\\r\\nbut were always calm and placid. They were never even impatient or\\r\\nill-humored, nor did they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a\\r\\nstock of patience for their wintering on the top of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and\\r\\noccasionally he killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach, and they reveled in fresh meat. One morning he went out as\\r\\nusual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of frost, and as\\r\\nthe sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to surprise the animals at\\r\\nthe approaches to the Wildstrubel, and Ulrich, being alone, remained in\\r\\nbed until ten o\\'clock. He was of a sleepy nature, but he would not have\\r\\ndared to give way like that to his inclination in the presence of the\\r\\nold guide, who was ever an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with\\r\\nSam, who also spent his days and nights in sleeping in front of the\\r\\nfire; then he felt low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and\\r\\nwas seized by a longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the\\r\\ndesire of an invincible habit, and so he went out to meet his companion,\\r\\nwho was to return at four o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow had leveled the whole deep valley, filled up the _crevasses_,\\r\\nobliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the rocks, so that\\r\\nbetween the high summits there was nothing but an immense, white,\\r\\nregular, dazzling and frozen surface. For three weeks, Ulrich had not\\r\\nbeen to the edge of the precipice, from which he had looked down onto\\r\\nthe village, and he wanted to go there before climbing the slopes which\\r\\nled to Wildstrubel. Loëche was now also covered by the snow, and the\\r\\nhouses could scarcely be distinguished, covered as they were by that\\r\\nwhite cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to the right, he reached the Lämmern glacier. He went along\\r\\nwith a mountaineer\\'s long strides, striking the snow, which was as hard\\r\\nas a rock, with his iron-shod stick, and with his piercing eyes, he\\r\\nlooked for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that\\r\\nenormous, white expanse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached the end of the glacier he stopped and asked himself\\r\\nwhether the old man had taken that road, and then he began to walk along\\r\\nthe moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The day was declining; the\\r\\nsnow was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry, frozen wind blew in rough\\r\\ngusts over its crystal surface. Ulrich uttered a long, shrill, vibrating\\r\\ncall; his voice sped through the deathlike silence in which the\\r\\nmountains were sleeping; it reached the distance, over profound and\\r\\nmotionless waves of glacial foam, like the cry of a bird over the waves\\r\\nof the sea; then it died away and nothing answered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set to walk again. The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain tops,\\r\\nwhich were still purple with the reflection from the sky; but the depths\\r\\nof the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt\\r\\nfrightened. It seemed to him as if the silence, the cold, the solitude,\\r\\nthe winter death of these mountains were taking possession of him, were\\r\\ngoing to stop and to freeze his blood, to make his limbs grow stiff, and\\r\\nto turn him into a motionless and frozen object; and he set off running,\\r\\nfleeing towards his dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have\\r\\nreturned during his absence. He had taken another road; he would, no\\r\\ndoubt, be sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe soon came in sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it. Ulrich\\r\\nwalked faster and opened the door; Sam ran up to him to greet him, but\\r\\nGaspard Hari had not returned. Kunzi, in his alarm, turned round\\r\\nsuddenly, as if he had expected to find his comrade hidden in a corner.\\r\\nThen he re-lighted the fire and made the soup; hoping every moment to\\r\\nsee the old man come in. From time to time he went out, to see if he\\r\\nwere not coming in. It was quite night now, that wan night of the\\r\\nmountains, a livid night, with the crescent moon, yellow and dim and\\r\\njust disappearing behind the mountain tops, lit up on the edge of the\\r\\nhorizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and his feet,\\r\\nwhile he pictured to himself every possible accident. Gaspard might have\\r\\nbroken a leg, have fallen into a crevasse, taken a false step and\\r\\ndislocated his ankle. And perhaps he was lying on the snow, overcome and\\r\\nstiff with the cold, in agony of mind, lost and perhaps shouting for\\r\\nhelp, calling with all his might, in the silence of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut where? The mountain was so vast, so rugged, so dangerous in places,\\r\\nespecially at that time of the year, that it would have required ten or\\r\\ntwenty guides to walk for a week in all directions, to find a man in\\r\\nthat immense space. Ulrich Kunzi, however, made up his mind to set out\\r\\nwith Sam, if Gaspard did not return by one in the morning; and he made\\r\\nhis preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel climbing\\r\\nirons, tied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist and looked to see\\r\\nthat his iron-shod stick and his axe, which served to cut steps in the\\r\\nice, were in order. Then he waited. The fire was burning on the hearth\\r\\nand the great dog was snoring in front of it, and the clock was ticking\\r\\nas regularly as a heart beating, in its case of resounding wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waited, with his ears on the alert for distant sounds, and he\\r\\nshivered when the wind blew against the roof and the walls. It struck\\r\\ntwelve, and he trembled. Then, as he felt frightened and shuddering, he\\r\\nput some water on the fire, so that he might have some hot coffee before\\r\\nstarting, and when the clock struck one he got up, woke Sam, opened the\\r\\ndoor and went off in the direction of the Wildstrubel. For five hours he\\r\\nmounted, scaling the rocks by means of his climbing irons, cutting into\\r\\nthe ice, advancing continually and occasionally hauling up the dog, who\\r\\nremained below at the foot of some slope that was too steep for him, by\\r\\nmeans of the rope. It was about six o\\'clock when he reached one of the\\r\\nsummits to which old Gaspard often came after chamois, and he waited\\r\\ntill it should be daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was growing pale over head, and suddenly a strange light,\\r\\nspringing, nobody could tell whence, illuminated the immense ocean of\\r\\npale mountain summits, which stretched for a thousand leagues around\\r\\nhim. One might have said that this vague brightness arose from the snow\\r\\nitself, in order to spread itself into space. By degrees the highest,\\r\\ndistant summits assumed a delicate, fleshlike rose color, and the red\\r\\nsun appeared behind the ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi set off again, walking like a hunter, bent and looking for\\r\\nany traces, and saying to his dog: \"Seek, old fellow, seek!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely, and\\r\\nfrom time to time shouting, uttering a loud, prolonged cry, which soon\\r\\ndied away in that silent vastness. Then, he put his ear to the ground,\\r\\nto listen; he thought he could distinguish a voice, and so he began to\\r\\nrun, and shouted again, but he heard nothing more and sat down, worn out\\r\\nand in despair. Towards midday, he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as\\r\\ntired as himself, something to eat also, and then he recommenced his\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came he was still walking, and he had walked more than\\r\\nthirty miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return home,\\r\\nand too tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a hole in the\\r\\nsnow and crouched in it with his dog, under a blanket which he had\\r\\nbrought with him. And the man and the dog lay side by side, warming\\r\\nthemselves one against the other, but frozen to the marrow,\\r\\nnevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept, his mind haunted by visions and his\\r\\nlimbs shaking with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron bars,\\r\\nand his spirits so low that he was ready to cry with grief, while his\\r\\nheart was beating so that he almost fell with excitement, when he\\r\\nthought he heard a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he imagined that he also was going to die of cold in the midst\\r\\nof this vast solitude, and the terror of such a death roused his\\r\\nenergies and gave him renewed vigor. He was descending towards the inn,\\r\\nfalling down and getting up again, and followed at a distance by Sam,\\r\\nwho was limping on three legs, and they did not reach Schwarenbach until\\r\\nfour o\\'clock in the afternoon. The house was empty, and the young man\\r\\nmade a fire, had something to eat and went to sleep, so worn out that he\\r\\ndid not think of anything more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slept for a long time, for a very long time, an unconquerable sleep.\\r\\nBut suddenly a voice, a cry, a name: \"Ulrich,\" aroused him from his\\r\\nprofound torpor and made him sit up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was it\\r\\none of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds?\\r\\nNo, he heard it still, that reverberating cry,--which had entered at his\\r\\nears and remained in his flesh,--to the tips of his sinewy fingers.\\r\\nCertainly, somebody had cried out, and called: \"Ulrich!\" There was\\r\\nsomebody there, near the house, there could be no doubt of that, and he\\r\\nopened the door and shouted: \"Is it you, Gaspard?\" with all the strength\\r\\nof his lungs. But there was no reply, no murmur, no groan, nothing. It\\r\\nwas quite dark, and the snow looked wan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind had risen, that icy wind that cracks the rocks, and leaves\\r\\nnothing alive on those deserted heights, and it came in sudden gusts,\\r\\nwhich were more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the\\r\\ndesert, and again Ulrich shouted: \"Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard!\" And then\\r\\nhe waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain! Then he shook\\r\\nwith terror and with a bound he was inside the inn, when he shut and\\r\\nbolted the door, and then he fell into a chair, trembling all over, for\\r\\nhe felt certain that his comrade had called him, at the moment he was\\r\\nexpiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sure of that, as sure as one is of being alive, or of eating a\\r\\npiece of bread. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two days and three\\r\\nnights somewhere, in some hole, in one of those deep, untrodden ravines\\r\\nwhose whiteness is more sinister than subterranean darkness. He had been\\r\\ndying for two days and three nights and he had just then died, thinking\\r\\nof his comrade. His soul, almost before it was released, had taken its\\r\\nflight to the inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by\\r\\nthat terrible and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead have,\\r\\nto haunt the living. That voiceless soul had cried to the wornout soul\\r\\nof the sleeper; it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach, or\\r\\nits curse on the man who had not searched carefully enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the wall,\\r\\nbehind the door which he had just fastened. It was wandering about, like\\r\\na night bird, which lightly touches a lighted window with his wings,\\r\\nand the terrified young man was ready to scream with horror. He wanted\\r\\nto run away, but did not dare to go out; he did not dare, and he should\\r\\nnever dare to do it in the future, for that phantom would remain there\\r\\nday and night, round the inn, as long as the old man\\'s body was not\\r\\nrecovered and had not been deposited in the consecrated earth of a\\r\\nchurchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight, Kunzi recovered some of his courage at the return\\r\\nof the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some food, and\\r\\nthen remained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart as he thought of\\r\\nthe old man lying on the snow, and then, as soon as night once more\\r\\ncovered the mountains, new terrors assailed him. He now walked up and\\r\\ndown the dark kitchen, which was scarcely lighted by the flame of one\\r\\ncandle, and he walked from one end of it to the other with great\\r\\nstrides, listening, listening whether the terrible cry of the other\\r\\nnight would again break the dreary silence outside. He felt himself\\r\\nalone, unhappy man, as no man had ever been alone before! He was alone\\r\\nin this immense desert of snow, alone five thousand feet above the\\r\\ninhabited earth, above human habitations, above that stirring, noisy,\\r\\npalpitating life, alone under an icy sky! A mad longing impelled him to\\r\\nrun away, no matter where, to get down to Loëche by flinging himself\\r\\nover the precipice; but he did not even dare to open the door, as he\\r\\nfelt sure that the other, the dead man, would bar his road, so that he\\r\\nmight not be obliged to remain up there alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards midnight, tired with walking, wornout by grief and fear, he at\\r\\nlast fell into a doze in his chair, for he was as afraid of his bed, as\\r\\none is of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the other\\r\\nevening pierced his ears, and it was so shrill that Ulrich stretched\\r\\nout his arms to repulse the ghost, and he fell onto his back with his\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl, like frightened dogs\\r\\ndo howl, and he walked all about the house, trying to find out where the\\r\\ndanger came from; but when he got to the door, he sniffed beneath it,\\r\\nsmelling vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail stiff, while\\r\\nhe growled angrily. Kunzi, who was terrified, jumped up, and holding his\\r\\nchair by one leg, he cried: \"Don\\'t come in, don\\'t come in, or I shall\\r\\nkill you.\" And the dog, excited by this threat, barked angrily at that\\r\\ninvisible enemy who defied his master\\'s voice. By degrees, however, he\\r\\nquieted down and came back and stretched himself in front of the fire,\\r\\nbut he was uneasy, and kept his head up, and growled between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with terror,\\r\\nhe went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard, and he drank\\r\\noff several glasses, one after another, at a gulp. His ideas became\\r\\nvague, his courage revived, and a feverish glow ran through his veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate scarcely anything the next day, and limited himself to alcohol,\\r\\nand so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As soon as he\\r\\nthought of Gaspard Hari, he began to drink again, and went on drinking\\r\\nuntil he fell onto the ground, overcome by intoxication. And there he\\r\\nremained on his face, dead drunk, his limbs benumbed, and snoring, with\\r\\nhis face to the ground. But scarcely had he digested the maddening and\\r\\nburning liquor, than the same cry, \"Ulrich,\" woke him like a bullet\\r\\npiercing his brain, and he got up, still staggering, stretching out his\\r\\nhands to save himself from falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And\\r\\nthe dog, who appeared to be going mad, like his master, rushed to the\\r\\ndoor, scratched it with his claws, and gnawed it with his long white\\r\\nteeth, while the young man, with his neck thrown back, and his head in\\r\\nthe air, drank the brandy in draughts, as if it had been cold water, so\\r\\nthat it might by and by send his thoughts, his frantic terror and his\\r\\nmemory, to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits, but his\\r\\ncontinual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke more furiously\\r\\nthan ever, as soon as it was impossible for him to calm it. His fixed\\r\\nidea then, which had been intensified by a month of drunkenness, and\\r\\nwhich was continually increasing in his absolute solitude, penetrated\\r\\nhim like a gimlet. He now walked about his house like a wild beast in\\r\\nits cage, putting his ear to the door to listen if the other were there,\\r\\nand defying him through the wall. Then, as soon as he dozed, overcome by\\r\\nfatigue, he heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last one night, like cowards do when driven to extremities, he sprang\\r\\nto the door and opened it, to see who was calling him, and to force him\\r\\nto keep quiet, but such a gust of cold wind blew into his face that it\\r\\nchilled him to the bone, and he closed and bolted the door again\\r\\nimmediately, without noticing that Sam had rushed out. Then, as he was\\r\\nshivering with cold, he threw some wood on the fire, and sat down in\\r\\nfront of it to warm himself, but suddenly he started, for somebody was\\r\\nscratching at the wall, and crying. In desperation he called out: \"Go\\r\\naway!\" but was answered by another long, sorrowful wail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, all his remaining senses forsook him, from sheer fright. He\\r\\nrepeated: \"Go away!\" and turned round to try to find some corner in\\r\\nwhich to hide, while the other person went round the house, still crying\\r\\nand rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak sideboard, which\\r\\nwas full of plates and dishes and of provisions, and lifting it up with\\r\\nsuperhuman strength, he dragged it to the door, so as to form a\\r\\nbarricade. Then piling up all the rest of the furniture, the mattresses,\\r\\npalliasses and chairs, he stopped up the windows like one does when\\r\\nassailed by an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful groans, to\\r\\nwhich the young man replied by similar groans, and thus days and nights\\r\\npassed, without their ceasing to howl at each other. The one was\\r\\ncontinually walking round the house, and scraped the walls with his\\r\\nnails so vigorously that it seemed as if he wished to destroy them,\\r\\nwhile the other, inside, followed all his movements, stooping down, and\\r\\nholding his ear to the walls, and replying to all his appeals with\\r\\nterrible cries. One evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he\\r\\nsat down, so overcome by fatigue, that he went to sleep immediately, and\\r\\nawoke in the morning without a thought, without any recollection of what\\r\\nhad happened, just as if his head had been emptied during his heavy\\r\\nsleep, but he felt hungry, and he ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter was over, and the Gemmi pass was practicable again, so the\\r\\nHauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as they had\\r\\nreached the top of the ascent, the women mounted their mule, and spoke\\r\\nabout the two men who they would meet again shortly. They were, indeed,\\r\\nrather surprised that neither of them had come down a few days before,\\r\\nas soon as the road became usable, in order to tell them all about their\\r\\nlong winter sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered\\r\\nwith snow, like a quilt. The door and the window were closed, but a\\r\\nlittle smoke was coming out of the chimney, which reassured old Hauser;\\r\\non going up to the door, however, he saw the skeleton of an animal which\\r\\nhad been torn to pieces by the eagles, a large skeleton lying on its\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all looked closely at it, and the mother said: \"That must be Sam,\"\\r\\nand then she shouted: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" A cry from the interior of the\\r\\nhouse answered her, and a sharp cry, that one might have thought some\\r\\nanimal had uttered it. Old Hauser repeated: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" and they\\r\\nheard another cry, similar to the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open the door,\\r\\nbut it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall they took a beam\\r\\nto serve as a battering-ram, and hurled it against the door with all\\r\\ntheir might. The wood gave way, and the boards flew into splinters; then\\r\\nthe house was shaken by a loud voice, and inside, behind the sideboard,\\r\\nwhich was overturned, they saw a man standing upright, with his hair\\r\\nfalling onto his shoulders, and a beard descending to his breast, with\\r\\nshining eyes and nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize\\r\\nhim, but Louise Hauser exclaimed: \"It is Ulrich, mother.\" And her mother\\r\\ndeclared that it was Ulrich, although his hair was white.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe allowed them to go up to him, and to touch him, but he did not reply\\r\\nto any of their questions, and they were obliged to take him to Loëche,\\r\\nwhere the doctors found that he was mad, and nobody ever knew what had\\r\\nbecome of his companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which the\\r\\nmedical men attributed to the cold air of the mountains.',\n"," 'UGLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, at this blessed epoch of Equality of mediocrity, of\\r\\nrectangular abomination, as Edgar Poe says, at this delightful period,\\r\\nwhen everybody dreams of resembling everybody else, so that it has\\r\\nbecome impossible to tell the President of the Republic from a waiter;\\r\\nin these days, which are the forerunners of that promising, blissful\\r\\nday, when everything in this world will be of a dully, neuter\\r\\nuniformity, certainly at such an epoch, one has the right, or rather it\\r\\nis one\\'s duty, to be ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, assuredly, exercised that right with the most cruel vigor,\\r\\nand he fulfilled that duty with the fiercest heroism, and to make\\r\\nmatters worse, the mysterious irony of fate had caused him to be born\\r\\nwith the name of Lebeau, while an ingenious godfather, the unconscious\\r\\naccomplice of the pranks of destiny, had given him the Christian name of\\r\\nAntinous.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven among our contemporaries, who were already on the high road to the\\r\\ncoming ideal of universal ugliness, Antinous Lebeau was remarkable for\\r\\nhis ugliness, and one might have said that he positively threw zeal, too\\r\\nmuch zeal, into the matter, though he was not hideous like Mirabeau, who\\r\\nmade the people exclaim: \"Oh! the beautiful monster!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! No. He was without any beauty, even without the beauty of\\r\\nugliness. He was ugly, that was all; nothing more nor less; in short, he\\r\\nwas uglily ugly. He was not humpbacked, nor knock-kneed, nor\\r\\npot-bellied; his legs were not like a pair of tongs, and his arms were\\r\\nneither too long nor too short, and yet, there was an utter lack of\\r\\nuniformity about him, not only in painters\\' eyes, but also in\\r\\neverybody\\'s, for nobody could meet him in the street without turning to\\r\\nlook after him, and thinking: \"Good heavens! What an object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hair was of no particular color; a light chestnut, mixed with\\r\\nyellow. There was not much of it, but still, he was not absolutely bald,\\r\\nbut quite bald enough to allow his butter-colored pate to show.\\r\\nButter-colored? Hardly! The color of margarine would be more applicable,\\r\\nand such pale margarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face was also like margarine, but of adulterated margarine,\\r\\ncertainly. By the side of it, his _cranium_, the color of unadulterated\\r\\nmargarine, looked almost like butter, by comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was very little to say about his mouth! Less than little; the sum\\r\\ntotal was--nothing. It was a chimerical mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut take it, that I have said nothing about him, and let us replace this\\r\\nvain description by the useful formula: _Impossible to describe him_.\\r\\nBut you must not forget that Antinous Lebeau was ugly, that the fact\\r\\nimpressed everybody as soon as they saw him, and that nobody remembered\\r\\never having seen an uglier person; and let us add, that as the climax of\\r\\nhis misfortune, he thought so himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this you will see that he was not a fool, but, then, he was not\\r\\nill-natured, either; but, of course, he was unhappy. An unhappy man\\r\\nthinks only of his wretchedness, and people take his night cap for a\\r\\nfool\\'s cap, while, on the other hand, goodness is only esteemed when it\\r\\nis cheerful. Consequently, Antinous Lebeau passed for a fool, and an\\r\\nill-tempered fool, and he was not even pitied because he was so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had only one pleasure in life, and that was to go and roam about the\\r\\ndarkest streets on dark nights, and to hear the street-walkers say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come home with me, you handsome, dark man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, alas! a furtive pleasure, and he knew that it was not true. For,\\r\\noccasionally, when the woman was old or drunk and he profited by the\\r\\ninvitation, as soon as the candle was lighted in the garret, they no\\r\\nlonger murmured the fallacious: _handsome, dark man_; and when they saw\\r\\nhim, the old women grew still older, and the drunken women got sober.\\r\\nAnd more than one, although hardened against disgust, and ready for all\\r\\nrisks, said to him, and in spite of his liberal payment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My little man, you are most confoundedly ugly, I must say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, however, he renounced even that lamentable pleasure, when he\\r\\nheard the still more lamentable words which a wretched woman could not\\r\\nhelp uttering when he went home with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he must have been very hungry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! He was hungry, unhappy man; hungry for love, for something that\\r\\nshould resemble love, were it ever so little; he longed not to live like\\r\\na pariah any more, not to be exiled and proscribed in his ugliness. And\\r\\nthe ugliest, the most repugnant woman would have appeared beautiful to\\r\\nhim, if she would only have not consented to think him ugly, or, at any\\r\\nrate, not to tell him so, and not to let him see that she felt horror\\r\\nat him on that account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequence was, that, when he one day met a poor, blear-eyed\\r\\ncreature, with her face covered with scabs, and bearing evident signs of\\r\\nalcoholism, with a driveling mouth, and ragged and filthy petticoats, to\\r\\nwhom he gave liberal alms, for which she kissed his hand, he took her\\r\\nhome with him, had her clean dressed and taken care of, made her his\\r\\nservant, and then his housekeeper. Next he raised her to the rank of his\\r\\nmistress, and, finally, of course, he married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was almost as ugly as he was! She really was; but only, almost.\\r\\nAlmost, but certainly not quite; for she was hideous, and her\\r\\nhideousness had its charm and its beauty, no doubt; that something by\\r\\nwhich a woman can attract a man. And she had proved that by deceiving\\r\\nhim, and she let him see it better still, by seducing another man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat other was actually uglier than he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was certainly uglier, that collection of every physical and moral\\r\\nugliness, that companion of beggars whom she had picked up among her\\r\\nformer vagrant associates, that jailbird, that dealer in little girls,\\r\\nthat vagabond covered with filth, with legs like a toad\\'s, with a mouth\\r\\nlike a lamprey, and a death\\'s head, in which the nose had been replaced\\r\\nby two holes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have wronged me with a wretch like that,\" the poor cuckold\\r\\nsaid. \"And in my own house! and in such a manner that I might catch you\\r\\nin the very act! And why, why, you wretch? Why, seeing that he is uglier\\r\\nthan I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no,\" she exclaimed. \"You may say what you like, but do not say that\\r\\nhe is uglier than you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the unhappy man stood there, vanquished and overcome by her last\\r\\nwords, which she uttered without understanding all the horror which he\\r\\nwould feel at them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you see, he has his own particular ugliness, while you are\\r\\nmerely ugly like everybody else is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Literally, \"The bird flies\"--a pun on the verb voler, which means\\r\\nboth \"to fly\" and \"to steal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Nickname for Napoleon III.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] _Jevôdre voir vô comment vô faites le painture?

But then things are as our eyes see them and as our minds make\\r\\nthem; and it is thus of primary importance for the critic to distinguish\\r\\nthe precise qualities of the eyes and minds which make the world into\\r\\nimaginative literature. Reality may be so definite and so false, just as\\r\\nit may be so fantastic and so true; and, among work which we can\\r\\napprehend as dealing justly with reality, there may be quite as much\\r\\ndifference in all that constitutes outward form and likeness as there is\\r\\nbetween a Dutch interior by Peter van der Hooch, the portrait of a king\\r\\nby Velasquez, and the image of a woman smiling by Leonardo da Vinci. The\\r\\nsoul, for instance, is at heart as real as the body; but, as we can hear\\r\\nit only through the body speaking, and see it only through bodily eyes,\\r\\nand measure it, often enough, only in the insignificant moment of its\\r\\naction, it may come to seem to us, at all events less realizable; and\\r\\nthus it is that we speak of those who have vividly painted exterior\\r\\nthings as realists. Properly speaking, Maupassant is no more a realist\\r\\nthan Maeterlinck. He paints a kind of reality which it is easier for us\\r\\nto recognize; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery artist has his own vision of the world. Maupassant\\'s vision was of\\r\\nsolid superficies, of texture which his hands could touch, of actions\\r\\nwhich his mind could comprehend from the mere sight of its incidents.\\r\\nHe saw the world as the Dutch painters saw it, and he was as great a\\r\\nmaster of form, of rich and sober color, of the imitation of the outward\\r\\ngestures of life, and of the fashion of external things. He had the same\\r\\nview of humanity, and shows us, with the same indifference, the same\\r\\nviolent ferment of life--the life of full-blooded people who have to\\r\\nelbow their way through the world. His sense of desire, of greed, of all\\r\\nthe baser passions, was profound: he had the terrible logic of\\r\\nanimalism. Love-making, drunkenness, cheating, quarreling, the mere\\r\\nidleness of sitting drowsily in a chair, the gross life of the farmyard\\r\\nand the fields, civic dissensions, the sordid provincial dance of the\\r\\nseven deadly sins, he saw in the same direct, unilluminating way as the\\r\\nDutch painters; finding, indeed, no beauty in any of these things, but\\r\\ngetting his beauty in the deft arrangement of them, in the mere act of\\r\\nplacing them in a picture. The world existed for him as something\\r\\nformless which could be cut up into little pictures. He saw no farther\\r\\nthan the lines of his frame. The interest of the thing began inside that\\r\\nframe, and what remained outside was merely material.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story of Maupassant, more than almost anything in the world, gives you\\r\\nthe impression of manual dexterity. It is adequately thought out, but it\\r\\ndoes not impress you by its thought; it is clearly seen, but it does not\\r\\nimpress you specially by the fidelity of its detail; it has just enough\\r\\nof ordinary human feeling for the limits it has imposed on itself. What\\r\\nimpresses you is the extreme ingenuity of its handling; the way in which\\r\\nthis juggler keeps his billiard-balls harmoniously rising and falling in\\r\\nthe air. Often, indeed, you cannot help noticing the conscious smile\\r\\nwhich precedes the trick, and the confident bow which concludes it. He\\r\\ndoes not let you into the secret of the trick, but he prevents you from\\r\\nignoring that it is after all, only a trick which you have been\\r\\nwatching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a philosophy of one kind or another behind the work of every\\r\\nartist. Maupassant\\'s was a simple one, sufficient for his needs as he\\r\\nunderstood them, though perhaps really consequent upon his artistic\\r\\nmethods, rather than at the root of them. It was the philosophy of\\r\\ncynicism: the most effectual means of limiting one\\'s outlook, of\\r\\nconcentrating all one\\'s energies on the task in hand. Maupassant wrote\\r\\nfor men of the world, and men of the world are content with the wisdom\\r\\nof their counting-houses. The man of the world is perfectly willing to\\r\\nadmit that he is no better than you, because he takes it for granted\\r\\nthat you will admit yourself to be no better than he. It is a way of\\r\\navoiding comparison. To Maupassant this cynical point of view was\\r\\ninvaluable for his purpose. He wanted to tell stories just for the\\r\\npleasure of telling them; he wanted to concern himself with his story\\r\\nsimply as a story; incidents interested him, not ideas, nor even\\r\\ncharacters, and he wanted every incident to be immediately effective.\\r\\nNow cynicism, in France, supplies a sufficient basis for all these\\r\\nrequirements; it is the equivalent, for popular purposes, of that appeal\\r\\nto the average which in England is sentimentality. Compare, for\\r\\ninstance, the admirable story \"Boule de Suif,\" perhaps the best story\\r\\nwhich Maupassant ever wrote, with a story of somewhat similar\\r\\nmotive--Bret Harte\\'s \"Outcasts of Poker Flat.\" Both stories are\\r\\npathetic; but the pathos of the American (who had formed himself upon\\r\\nDickens, and in the English tradition) becomes sentimental, and gets its\\r\\nsuccess by being sentimental; while the pathos of the Frenchman (who has\\r\\nformed himself on Flaubert, and on French lines) gets its success\\r\\nprecisely by being cynical.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the particular variety of Maupassant\\'s cynicism was just that\\r\\nvariation of the artistic idea upon the temperament which puts the best\\r\\nfinish upon work necessarily so limited, obliged to be so clenching, as\\r\\nthe short story. Flaubert\\'s gigantic dissatisfaction with life, his\\r\\nreally philosophic sense of its vanity, would have overweighted a writer\\r\\nso thoroughly equipped for his work as the writer of \"Boule de Suif\" and\\r\\n\"La Maison Tellier.\" Maupassant had no time, he allowed himself no\\r\\nspace, to reason about life; the need was upon him to tell story after\\r\\nstory, each with its crisis, its thrill, its summing up of a single\\r\\nexistence or a single action. The sharp, telling thrust that his\\r\\nconception of art demanded could be given only by a very specious, not\\r\\nvery profound, very forthright, kind of cynicism, like the half kindly,\\r\\nhalf contemptuous laugh of the man who tells a good story at the club.\\r\\nFor him it was the point of the epigram.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaupassant was the man of his period, and his period was that of\\r\\nNaturalism. In \"Les Soirees de Medan,\" the volume in which \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\" appeared, there is another story called \"Sac au Dos,\" in which\\r\\nanother novelist made his appearance among the five who \"publicly\\r\\naffirmed their literary tendencies\" about the central figure of Zola. J.\\r\\nK. Huysmans, then but at the outset of his slow and painful course\\r\\nthrough schools and experiments, was in time to sum up the new\\r\\ntendencies of a new period, as significantly as Maupassant summed up in\\r\\nhis short and brilliant, and almost undeviating career, the tendencies\\r\\nof that period in which Taine and science seemed to have at last found\\r\\nout the physical basis of life. Now it is a new realism which appeals to\\r\\nus: it is the turn of the soul. The battle which the \"Soirees de Medan\"\\r\\nhelped to win has been won; having gained our right to deal with humble\\r\\nand unpleasant and sordidly tragic things in fiction, we are free to\\r\\nconcern ourselves with other things. But though the period has passed,\\r\\nand will not return, the masterpieces of the period remain. Among these\\r\\nmasterpieces are the novels and short stories of Guy de Maupassant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 ARTHUR SYMONS.',\n"," 'BOULE DE SUIF\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days, straggling remnants of the routed army had passed\\r\\nthrough the town. There was no question of organized troops, it was\\r\\nsimply a disjointed rabble, the men unshaven and dirty, their uniforms\\r\\nin tatters, slouching along without regimental colors, without\\r\\norder--worn out, broken down, incapable of thought or resolution,\\r\\nmarching from pure habit and dropping with fatigue the moment they\\r\\nstopped. The majority belonged to the militia, men of peaceful pursuits,\\r\\nretired tradespeople, sinking under the weight of their accouterments;\\r\\nquick-witted little moblets as prone to terror as they were to\\r\\nenthusiasm, as ready to attack as they were to fly; and here and there a\\r\\nfew red trousers, remnants of a company mowed down in one of the big\\r\\nbattles; somber-coated artillerymen, side by side with these various\\r\\nuniforms of the infantry, and now and then the glittering helmet of a\\r\\nheavily booted dragoon who followed with difficulty the march of the\\r\\nlighter-footed soldiers of the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies of franc-tireurs, heroically named \"Avengers of the Defeat,\"\\r\\n\"Citizens of the Tomb,\" \"Companies in Death,\" passed in their turn,\\r\\nlooking like a horde of bandits.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir chiefs--formerly drapers or corn-dealers, retired soap-boilers or\\r\\nsuet-refiners, warriors of circumstance created officers for their money\\r\\nor the length of their moustaches, heaped with arms, flannels, and gold\\r\\nlace--talked loudly, discussed plans of campaign, and gave you to\\r\\nunderstand that they were the sole support of France in her death-agony;\\r\\nbut they were generally in terror of their own soldiers, men \"of the\\r\\nsack and cord,\" most of them brave to foolhardiness, all of them given\\r\\nto pillage and debauchery.\\r\\n\\r\\nReport said that the Prussians were about to enter Rouen. The National\\r\\nGuard, which for two months past had made the most careful\\r\\nreconnoiterings in the neighboring wood, even to the extent of\\r\\noccasionally shooting their own sentries and putting themselves in\\r\\nbattle array if a rabbit stirred in the brushwood, had now retired to\\r\\ntheir domestic hearths; their arms, their uniforms, all the murderous\\r\\napparatus with which they had been wont to strike terror to the hearts\\r\\nof all beholders for three leagues round, had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the last of the French soldiery crossed the Seine on their way\\r\\nto Pont-Audemer by Saint Sever and Bourg-Achard; and then, last of all,\\r\\ncame their despairing general tramping on foot between two orderlies,\\r\\npowerless to attempt any action with these disjointed fragments of his\\r\\nforces, himself utterly dazed and bewildered by the downfall of a people\\r\\naccustomed to victory and now so disastrously beaten in spite of its\\r\\ntraditional bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that a profound calm, the silence of terrified suspense, fell over\\r\\nthe city. Many a rotund bourgeois, emasculated by a purely commercial\\r\\nlife, awaited the arrival of the victors with anxiety, trembling lest\\r\\ntheir meat-skewers and kitchen carving-knives should come under the\\r\\ncategory of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife seemed to have come to a standstill, the shops were closed, the\\r\\nstreets silent. From time to time an inhabitant, intimidated by their\\r\\nsilence, would flit rapidly along the pavement, keeping close to the\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this anguish of suspense, men longed for the coming of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter part of the day following the departure of the French\\r\\ntroops, some Uhlans, appearing from goodness knows where, traversed the\\r\\ncity hastily. A little later, a black mass descended from the direction\\r\\nof Sainte-Catherine, while two more invading torrents poured in from the\\r\\nroads from Darnetal and Bois-guillaume. The advance guards of the three\\r\\ncorps converged at the same moment into the square of the Hotel de\\r\\nVille, while battalion after battalion of the German army wound in\\r\\nthrough the adjacent streets, making the pavement ring under their heavy\\r\\nrhythmic tramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders shouted in strange and guttural tones were echoed back by the\\r\\napparently dead and deserted houses, while from behind the closed\\r\\nshutters eyes peered furtively at the conquerors, masters by right of\\r\\nmight, of the city and the lives and fortunes of its inhabitants. The\\r\\npeople in their darkened dwellings fell a prey to the helpless\\r\\nbewilderment which comes over men before the floods, the devastating\\r\\nupheavals of the earth, against which all wisdom and all force are\\r\\nunavailing. The same phenomenon occurs each time that the established\\r\\norder of things is overthrown, when public security is at an end, and\\r\\nwhen all that the laws of man or of nature protect is at the mercy of\\r\\nsome blind elemental force. The earthquake burying an entire population\\r\\nunder its falling houses; the flood that carries away the drowned body\\r\\nof the peasant with the carcasses of his cattle and the beams torn from\\r\\nhis roof-tree; or the victorious army massacring those who defend their\\r\\nlives, and making prisoners of the rest--pillaging in the name of the\\r\\nsword, and thanking God to the roar of cannon--are so many appalling\\r\\nscourges which overthrow all faith in eternal justice, all the\\r\\nconfidence we are taught to place in the protection of Providence and\\r\\nthe reason of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall detachments now began knocking at the doors and then disappearing\\r\\ninto the houses. It was the occupation after the invasion. It now\\r\\nbehooved the vanquished to make themselves agreeable to the victors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, the first alarms having subsided, a new sense of\\r\\ntranquillity began to establish itself. In many families the Prussian\\r\\nofficer shared the family meals. Not infrequently he was a gentleman,\\r\\nand out of politeness expressed his commiseration with France and his\\r\\nrepugnance at having to take part in such a war. They were grateful\\r\\nenough to him for this sentiment--besides, who knew when they might not\\r\\nbe glad of his protection? By gaining his good offices one might have\\r\\nfewer men to feed. And why offend a person on whom one was utterly\\r\\ndependent? That would not be bravery but temerity, a quality of which\\r\\nthe citizens of Rouen could no longer be accused as in the days of those\\r\\nheroic defenses by which the city had made itself famous. Above all,\\r\\nthey said, with the unassailable urbanity of the Frenchman, it was\\r\\nsurely permissible to be on politely familiar terms in private, provided\\r\\none held aloof from the foreign soldier in public. In the street,\\r\\ntherefore, they ignored one another\\'s existence, but once indoors they\\r\\nwere perfectly ready to be friendly, and each evening found the German\\r\\nstaying longer at the family fireside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town itself gradually regained its wonted aspect. The French\\r\\ninhabitants did not come out much, but the Prussian soldiers swarmed in\\r\\nthe streets. For the rest, the blue hussar officers who trailed their\\r\\nmighty implements of death so arrogantly over the pavement did not\\r\\nappear to entertain a vastly deeper grade of contempt for the simple\\r\\ntownsfolk than did the officers of the Chasseurs who had drunk in the\\r\\nsame cafés the year before. Nevertheless there was a something in the\\r\\nair; something subtle and indefinable, an intolerably unfamiliar\\r\\natmosphere like a widely diffused odor--the odor of invasion. It filled\\r\\nthe private dwellings and the public places, it affected the taste of\\r\\nfood, and gave one the impression of being on a journey, far away from\\r\\nhome, among barbarous and dangerous tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conquerors demanded money--a great deal of money. The inhabitants\\r\\npaid and went on paying; for the matter of that, they were rich. But the\\r\\nwealthier a Normandy tradesman becomes, the more keenly he suffers at\\r\\neach sacrifice each time he sees the smallest particle of his fortune\\r\\npass into the hands of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo or three leagues beyond the town, however, following the course of\\r\\nthe river about Croisset Dieppedalle or Biessard, the sailors and the\\r\\nfishermen would often drag up the swollen corpse of some uniformed\\r\\nGerman, killed by a knife-thrust or a kick, his head smashed in by a\\r\\nstone, or thrown into the water from some bridge. The slime of the river\\r\\nbed swallowed up many a deed of vengeance, obscure, savage, and\\r\\nlegitimate; unknown acts of heroism, silent onslaughts more perilous to\\r\\nthe doer than battles in the light of day and without the trumpet\\r\\nblasts of glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor hatred of the Alien is always strong enough to arm some intrepid\\r\\nbeings who are ready to die for an Idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, seeing that though the invaders had subjected the city to their\\r\\ninflexible discipline they had not committed any of the horrors with\\r\\nwhich rumor had accredited them throughout the length of their triumphal\\r\\nprogress, the worthy tradespeople took heart of grace and the commercial\\r\\nspirit began once more to stir within them. Some of them who had grave\\r\\ninterests at stake at Havre, then occupied by the French army, purposed\\r\\ntrying to reach that port by going overland to Dieppe and there taking\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took advantage of the influence of German officers whose\\r\\nacquaintance they had made, and a passport was obtained from the general\\r\\nin command.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving therefore engaged a large diligence with four horses for the\\r\\njourney, and ten persons having entered their names at the livery stable\\r\\noffice, they resolved to start on the Tuesday morning before daybreak,\\r\\nto avoid all public remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some days already the ground had been hard with frost, and on the\\r\\nMonday, about three o\\'clock in the afternoon, thick dark clouds coming\\r\\nup from the north brought the snow, which fell without intermission all\\r\\nthe evening and during the whole night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half past four the travelers were assembled in the courtyard of the\\r\\nHotel de Normandie, from whence they were to start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all still half asleep, their teeth chattering with cold in\\r\\nspite of their thick wraps. It was difficult to distinguish one from\\r\\nanother in the darkness, their heaped-up winter clothing making them\\r\\nlook like fat priests in long cassocks. Two of the men, however,\\r\\nrecognized each other; they were joined by a third, and they began to\\r\\ntalk. \"I am taking my wife with me,\" said one. \"So am I.\" \"And I too.\"\\r\\nThe first one added: \"We shall not return to Rouen, and if the Prussians\\r\\ncome to Havre we shall slip over to England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all like-minded and all had the same project.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile there was no sign of the horses being put in. A small lantern\\r\\ncarried by a hostler appeared from time to time out of one dark doorway\\r\\nonly to vanish instantly into another. There was a stamping of horses\\'\\r\\nhoofs deadened by the straw of the litter, and the voice of a man\\r\\nspeaking to the animals and cursing sounded from the depths of the\\r\\nstables. A faint sound of bells gave evidence of harnessing, and became\\r\\npresently a clear and continuous jingle timed by the movement of the\\r\\nbeast, now stopping, now going on again with a brisk shake, and\\r\\naccompanied by the dull tramp of hob-nailed sabots.\\r\\n\\r\\nA door closed sharply. All sound ceased. The frozen travelers were\\r\\nsilent, standing stiff and motionless. A veil of white snow-flakes\\r\\nglistened incessantly as it fell to the ground, blotting out the shape\\r\\nof things, powdering everything with an icy froth; and in the utter\\r\\nstillness of the town, quiet and buried under its winter pall, nothing\\r\\nwas audible but this faint, fluttering, and indefinable rustle of\\r\\nfalling snow--more a sensation than a sound--the intermingling of\\r\\nethereal atoms seeming to fill space, to cover the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man reappeared with his lantern, dragging after him by a rope a\\r\\ndejected and unwilling horse. He pushed it against the pole, fixed the\\r\\ntraces, and was occupied for a long time in buckling the harness, having\\r\\nonly the use of one hand as he carried the lantern in the other. As he\\r\\nturned away to fetch the other horse he caught sight of the motionless\\r\\ngroup of travelers, by this time white with snow. \"Why don\\'t you get\\r\\ninside the carriage?\" he said, \"you would at least be under cover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had never occurred to them, and they made a rush for it. The three\\r\\nmen packed their wives into the upper end and then got in themselves,\\r\\nafter which other distinct and veiled forms took the remaining seats\\r\\nwithout exchanging a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor of the vehicle was covered with straw into which the feet\\r\\nsank. The ladies at the end, who had brought little copper charcoal\\r\\nfoot-warmers, proceeded to light them, and for some time discussed their\\r\\nmerits in subdued tones, repeating to one another things which they had\\r\\nknown all their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the diligence having been furnished with six horses instead of\\r\\nfour on account of the difficulties of the road, a voice outside asked,\\r\\n\"Is everybody here?\" A voice from within answered \"Yes,\" and they\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conveyance advanced slowly--slowly--the wheels sinking in the snow;\\r\\nthe whole vehicle groaned and creaked, the horses slipped, wheezed, and\\r\\nsmoked, and the driver\\'s gigantic whip cracked incessantly, flying from\\r\\nside to side, twining and untwining like a slender snake, and cutting\\r\\nsharply across one or other of the six humping backs, which would\\r\\nthereupon straighten up with a more violent effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperceptibly the day grew. The airy flakes which a traveler--a\\r\\nRouennais \"pur sang\"--once likened to a shower of cotton, had ceased to\\r\\nfall; a dirty gray light filtered through the heavy thick clouds which\\r\\nserved to heighten the dazzling whiteness of the landscape, where now a\\r\\nlong line of trees crusted with icicles would appear, now a cottage with\\r\\na hood of snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of this melancholy dawn the occupants of the diligence\\r\\nbegan to examine one another curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight at the end, in the best seats, opposite to one another, dozed\\r\\nMadame and Monsieur Loiseau, whole-sale wine merchant of the Rue Grand\\r\\nPont.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former salesman of a master who had become bankrupt, Loiseau had\\r\\nbought up the stock and made his fortune. He sold very bad wine at very\\r\\nlow prices to the small country retail dealers, and enjoyed the\\r\\nreputation among his friends and acquaintances of being an unmitigated\\r\\nrogue, a thorough Norman full of trickery and jovial humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis character for knavery was so well established that one evening at\\r\\nthe Prefecture, Monsieur Tournel, a man of keen and trenchant wit,\\r\\nauthor of certain fables and songs--a local glory--seeing the ladies\\r\\ngrowing drowsy, proposed a game of \"L\\'oiseau vole.\"[1] The pun itself\\r\\nflew through the prefect\\'s reception rooms and afterwards through the\\r\\ntown, and for a whole month called up a grin on every face in the\\r\\nprovince.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau was himself a noted wag and famous for his jokes both good and\\r\\nbad, and nobody ever mentioned him without adding immediately, \"That\\r\\nLoiseau is simply priceless!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was of medium height with a balloon-like stomach and a rubicund face\\r\\nframed in grizzled whiskers. His wife--tall, strong, resolute, loud in\\r\\nvoice and rapid of decision--represented order and arithmetic in the\\r\\nbusiness, which he enlivened by his jollity and bustling activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside them, in a more dignified attitude as befitted his superior\\r\\nstation, sat Monsieur Carré-Lamadon, a man of weight; an authority on\\r\\ncotton, proprietor of three branch businesses, officer of the Legion of\\r\\nHonor and member of the General Council. All the time of the Empire he\\r\\nhad remained leader of a friendly opposition, for the sole purpose of\\r\\nmaking a better thing out of it when he came round to the cause which he\\r\\nhad fought with polite weapons, to use his own expression. Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon, who was much younger than her husband, was the\\r\\nconsolation of all officers of good family who might be quartered at the\\r\\nRouen garrison. She sat there opposite to her husband, very small, very\\r\\ndainty, very pretty, wrapped in her furs, and regarding the lamentable\\r\\ninterior of the vehicle with despairing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir neighbors, the Count and Countess Hubert de Breville, bore one of\\r\\nthe most ancient and noble names in Normandy. The Count, an elderly\\r\\ngentleman of dignified appearance, did all in his power to accentuate by\\r\\nevery artifice of the toilet his natural resemblance to Henri Quatre,\\r\\nwho, according to a legend of the utmost glory to the family, had\\r\\nhonored with his royal embraces a Dame de Breville, whose husband had,\\r\\nin consequence, been made Count and Governor of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nA colleague of Monsieur Carré-Lamadon in the General Council, Count\\r\\nHubert represented the Orleanist faction in the department. The history\\r\\nof his marriage with the daughter of a small tradesman of Nantes had\\r\\nalways remained a mystery. But as the Countess had an air of grandeur,\\r\\nunderstood better than any one else the art of receiving, passed even\\r\\nfor having been beloved by one of the sons of Louis Philippe, the\\r\\nneighboring nobility bowed down to her, and her salon held the first\\r\\nplace in the county, the only one which preserved the traditions of the\\r\\nviel le galanterie and to which the entreé was difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fortune of the Brevilles--all in Government Funds--was reported to\\r\\nyield them an income of five hundred thousand francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six passengers occupied the upper end of the conveyance, the\\r\\nrepresentatives of revenued society, serene in the consciousness of its\\r\\nstrength--honest well-to-do people possessed of Religion and Principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some strange chance all the women were seated on the same side, the\\r\\nCountess having two sisters of Mercy for neighbors, wholly occupied in\\r\\nfingering their long rosaries and mumbling Paters and Aves. One of them\\r\\nwas old and so deeply pitted with the small-pox that she looked as if\\r\\nshe had received a charge of grape shot full in the face; the other was\\r\\nvery shadowy and frail, with a pretty unhealthy little face, a narrow\\r\\nphthisical chest, consumed by that devouring faith which creates martyrs\\r\\nand ecstatics.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated opposite to the two nuns were a man and woman who excited a good\\r\\ndeal of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, who was well known, was Cornudet, \"the demon,\" the terror of\\r\\nall respectable, law-abiding people. For twenty years he had dipped his\\r\\ngreat red beard into the beer mugs of all the democratic café\\'s. In the\\r\\ncompany of kindred spirits he had managed to run through a comfortable\\r\\nlittle fortune inherited from his father, a confectioner, and he looked\\r\\nforward with impatience to the Republic, when he should obtain the\\r\\nwell-merited reward for so many revolutionary draughts. On the Fourth of\\r\\nSeptember--probably through some practical joke--he understood that he\\r\\nhad been appointed prefect, but on attempting to enter upon his duties\\r\\nthe clerks, who had remained sole masters of the offices, refused to\\r\\nrecognize him, and he was constrained to retire. For the rest, he was a\\r\\ngood fellow, inoffensive and serviceable, and had busied himself with\\r\\nincomparable industry in organizing the defense of the town; had had\\r\\nholes dug all over the plain, cut down all the young trees in the\\r\\nneighboring woods, scattered pitfalls up and down all the high roads,\\r\\nand at the threatened approach of the enemy--satisfied with his\\r\\npreparations--had fallen back with all haste on the town. He now\\r\\nconsidered that he would be more useful in Havre, where fresh\\r\\nentrenchments would soon become necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, one of the so-called \"gay\" sisterhood, was noted for her\\r\\nprecocious stoutness, which had gained her the nickname of \"Boule de\\r\\nSuif\"--\"ball of fat.\" She was a little roly-poly creature, cushioned\\r\\nwith fat, with podgy fingers squeezed in at the joints like rows of\\r\\nthick, short sausages; her skin tightly stretched and shiny, her bust\\r\\nenormous, and yet with it all so wholesomely, temptingly fresh and\\r\\nappetizing that it was a pleasure to look at her. Her face was like a\\r\\nruddy apple--a peony rose just burst into bloom--and out of it gazed a\\r\\npair of magnificent dark eyes overshadowed by long thick lashes that\\r\\ndeepened their blackness; and lower down, a charming little mouth, dewy\\r\\nto the kiss, and furnished with a row of tiny milk-white teeth. Over and\\r\\nabove all this she was, they said, full of inestimable qualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was her identity recognized than a whisper ran through the\\r\\nladies in which the words \"prostitute\" and \"public scandal,\" were so\\r\\nconspicuously distinct that she raised her head and retaliated by\\r\\nsweeping her companions with such a bold and defiant look that deep\\r\\nsilence instantly fell upon them, and they all cast down their eyes with\\r\\nthe exception of Loiseau, who watched her with a kindling eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, conversation was soon resumed between the three ladies, whom\\r\\nthe presence of this \"person\" had suddenly rendered friendly--almost\\r\\nintimate. It seemed to them that they must, as it were, raise a rampart\\r\\nof their dignity as spouses between them and this shameless creature who\\r\\nmade a traffic of herself; for legalized love always takes a high hand\\r\\nwith her unlicensed sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men too, drawn to one another by a conservative instinct at\\r\\nsight of Cornudet, talked money in a certain tone of contempt for the\\r\\nimpecunious. Count Hubert spoke of the damage inflicted on him by the\\r\\nPrussians, of the losses which would result to him from the seizing of\\r\\ncattle and from ruined crops, but with all the assurance of a great\\r\\nlanded proprietor, ten times millionaire, whom these ravages might\\r\\ninconvenience for the space of a year at most. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon,\\r\\nof great experience in the cotton industry, had taken the precaution to\\r\\nsend six hundred thousand francs across to England as provision against\\r\\na rainy day. As for Loiseau, he made arrangements to sell all the wine\\r\\nin his cellars to the French commission of supplies, consequently the\\r\\nGovernment owed him a formidable sum, which he counted upon receiving at\\r\\nHavre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three exchanged rapid and amicable glances. Although differing in\\r\\nposition they felt themselves brothers in money, and of the great\\r\\nfreemasonry of those who possess, of those who can make the gold jingle\\r\\nwhen they put their hands in the breeches-pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diligence went so slowly that by ten o\\'clock in the morning they had\\r\\nnot made four leagues. The men got out three times and climbed the hill\\r\\non foot. They began to grow anxious, for they were to have lunched at\\r\\nTotes, and now they despaired of reaching that place before night.\\r\\nEverybody was on the look-out for some inn by the way, when the vehicle\\r\\nstuck fast in a snowdrift, and it took two hours to get it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the pangs of hunger began to affect them severely both in mind\\r\\nand body, and yet not an inn, not a tavern even, was to be seen; the\\r\\napproach of the Prussians and the passage of the famished French troops\\r\\nhad frightened away all trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen foraged diligently for the provisions in the farms by the\\r\\nroadside; but they failed to obtain so much as a piece of bread, for the\\r\\nmistrustful peasant hid all reserve stores for fear of being pillaged by\\r\\nthe soldiers, who, having no food supplied to them, took by force\\r\\neverything they could lay their hands on.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards one o\\'clock Loiseau announced that he felt a very decided void\\r\\nin his stomach. Everybody had been suffering in the same manner for a\\r\\nlong time, and the violent longing for food had extinguished\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time to time some one would yawn, to be almost immediately imitated\\r\\nby another and then each of the rest in turn, and according to their\\r\\ndisposition, manners, or social standing, would open their mouth\\r\\nnoisily, or modestly cover with the hand the gaping cavity from which\\r\\nthe breath issued in a vapor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif had several times stooped down as if feeling for something\\r\\nunder her skirts. She hesitated a moment, looked at her companions, and\\r\\nthen composedly resumed her former position. The faces were pale and\\r\\ndrawn. Loiseau declared he would give a thousand francs for a ham. His\\r\\nwife made a faint movement as to protest, but restrained herself. It\\r\\nalways affected her painfully to hear of money being thrown away, nor\\r\\ncould she even understand a joke upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To tell the truth,\" said the Count, \"I do not feel quite myself\\r\\neither--how could I have omitted to think of bringing provisions?\" And\\r\\neverybody reproached themselves with the same neglectfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, however, had a flask of rum which he offered round. It was\\r\\ncoldly refused. Loiseau alone accepted a mouthful, and handed back the\\r\\nflask with thanks saying, \"That\\'s good! that warms you up and keeps the\\r\\nhunger off a bit.\" The alcohol raised his spirits somewhat, and he\\r\\nproposed that they should do the same as on the little ship in the\\r\\nsong--eat the fattest of the passengers. This indirect but obvious\\r\\nallusion to Boule De Suif shocked the gentle people. Nobody responded\\r\\nand only Cornudet smiled. The two Sisters of Mercy had ceased to tell\\r\\ntheir beads and sat motionless, their hands buried in their wide\\r\\nsleeves, their eyes obstinately lowered, doubtless engaged in offering\\r\\nback to Heaven the sacrifice of suffering which it sent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, at three o\\'clock, when they were in the middle of an\\r\\ninterminable stretch of bare country without a single village in sight,\\r\\nBoule de Suif, stooping hurriedly, drew from under the seat a large\\r\\nbasket covered with a white napkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of it she took, first of all, a little china plate and a delicate\\r\\nsilver drinking-cup, and then an immense dish, in which two whole fowls\\r\\nready carved lay stiffened in their jelly. Other good things were\\r\\nvisible in the basket: patties, fruits, pastry--in fact provisions for a\\r\\nthree days\\' journey in order to be independent of inn cookery. The necks\\r\\nof four bottles protruded from between the parcels of food. She took the\\r\\nwing of a fowl and began to eat it daintily with one of those little\\r\\nrolls which they call \"Regence\" in Normandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery eye was fixed upon her. As the odor of the food spread through the\\r\\ncarriage nostrils began to quiver and mouths to fill with water, while\\r\\nthe jaws, just below the ears contracted painfully. The dislike\\r\\nentertained by the ladies for this abandoned young woman grew savage,\\r\\nalmost to the point of longing to murder her or at least to turn her out\\r\\ninto the snow, her and her drinking-cup and her basket and her\\r\\nprovisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, was devouring the dish of chicken with his eyes.\\r\\n\"Madame has been more prudent than we,\" he said. \"Some people always\\r\\nthink of everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head in his direction. \"If you would care for any,\\r\\nMonsieur--? It is not comfortable to fast for so long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed. \"Ma foi!--frankly, I won\\'t refuse. I can\\'t stand this any\\r\\nlonger--the fortune of war, is it not, madame?\" And with a comprehensive\\r\\nlook he added: \"In moments such as this we are only too glad to find any\\r\\none who will oblige us.\" He had a newspaper which he spread on his knee\\r\\nto save his trousers, and with the point of a knife which he always\\r\\ncarried in his pocket he captured a drumstick all glazed with jelly,\\r\\ntore it with his teeth, and then proceeded to chew it with satisfaction\\r\\nso evident that a deep groan of distress went up from the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this Boule de Suif in a gentle and humble tone invited the two\\r\\nSisters to share the collation. They both accepted on the spot, and\\r\\nwithout raising their eyes began to eat very hurriedly, after stammering\\r\\na few words of thanks. Nor did Cornudet refuse his neighbor\\'s offer, and\\r\\nwith the Sisters they formed a kind of table by spreading out newspapers\\r\\non their knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jaws opened and shut without a pause, biting, chewing, gulping\\r\\nferociously. Loiseau, hard at work in his corner, urged his wife in a\\r\\nlow voice to follow his example. She resisted for some time, then, after\\r\\na pang which gripped her very vitals, she gave in. Whereupon her\\r\\nhusband, rounding off his phrases, asked if their \"charming\\r\\nfellow-traveler\" would permit him to offer a little something to Madame\\r\\nLoiseau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes, certainly, Monsieur,\" she answered with a pleasant smile, and\\r\\nhanded him the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment of embarrassment when the first bottle of claret was\\r\\nuncorked--there was but the one drinking-cup. Each one wiped it before\\r\\npassing it to the rest. Cornudet alone, from an impulse of gallantry no\\r\\ndoubt, placed his lips on the spot still wet from the lips of his\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was that, surrounded by people who were eating, suffocated by\\r\\nthe fragrant odor of the viands, the Count and Countess de Breville and\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Carré-Lamadon suffered the agonies of that torture\\r\\nwhich has ever been associated with the name of Tantalus. Suddenly the\\r\\nyoung wife of the cotton manufacturer gave a deep sigh. Every head\\r\\nturned towards her; she was as white as the snow outside, her eyes\\r\\nclosed, her head fell forward--she had fainted. Her husband, distraught\\r\\nwith fear, implored assistance of the whole company. All lost their\\r\\nheads till the elder of the two Sisters, who supported the unconscious\\r\\nlady, forced Boule de Suif\\'s drinking-cup between her lips and made her\\r\\nswallow a few drops of wine. The pretty creature stirred, opened her\\r\\neyes, smiled and then declared in an expiring voice that she felt quite\\r\\nwell now. But to prevent her being overcome again in the same manner,\\r\\nthe Sister induced her to drink a full cup of wine, adding, \"It is\\r\\nsimply hunger--nothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Boule de Suif, blushing violently, looked at the four starving\\r\\npassengers and faltered shyly, \"Mon Dieu! If I might make so bold as to\\r\\noffer the ladies and gentlemen--\" She stopped short, fearing a rude\\r\\nrebuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, at once threw himself into the breach. \"Parbleu! under\\r\\nsuch circumstances we are all companions in misfortune and bound to help\\r\\neach other. Come, ladies, don\\'t stand on ceremony--take what you can get\\r\\nand be thankful: who knows whether we shall be able to find so much as\\r\\na house where we can spend the night? At this rate we shall not reach\\r\\nTotes till to-morrow afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey still hesitated, nobody having the courage to take upon themselves\\r\\nthe responsibility of the decisive \"Yes.\" Finally the Count seized the\\r\\nbull by the horns. Adopting his most grandiose air, he turned with a bow\\r\\nto the embarrassed young woman and said, \"We accept your offer with\\r\\nthanks, madame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first step only was difficult. The Rubicon once crossed, they fell\\r\\nto with a will. They emptied the basket, which contained, besides the\\r\\nprovisions already mentioned; a pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece\\r\\nof smoked tongue, some pears, a slab of gingerbread, mixed biscuits, and\\r\\na cup of pickled onions and gherkins in vinegar--for, like all women,\\r\\nBoule de Suif adored crudities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not well eat the young woman\\'s provisions and not speak to\\r\\nher, so they conversed--stiffly at first, and then, seeing that she\\r\\nshowed no signs of presuming, with less reserve. Mesdames de Breville\\r\\nand Carré-Lamadon, having a great deal of \"savoir vivre,\" knew how to\\r\\nmake themselves agreeable with tact and delicacy. The Countess, in\\r\\nparticular, exhibited the amiable condescension of the extremely\\r\\nhigh-born lady whom no contact can sully, and was charming. But big\\r\\nMadame Loiseau, who had the soul of a gendarme, remained unmoved,\\r\\nspeaking little and eating much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation naturally turned upon the war. They related horrible\\r\\ndeeds committed by the Prussians and examples of the bravery of the\\r\\nFrench; all these people who were flying rendering full homage to the\\r\\ncourage of those who remained behind. Incidents of personal experience\\r\\nsoon followed, and Boule de Suif told, with that warmth of coloring\\r\\nwhich women of her type often employ in expressing their natural\\r\\nfeelings, how she had come to leave Rouen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought at first I should be able to hold out,\" she said, \"for I had\\r\\nplenty of provisions in my house, and would much rather feed a few\\r\\nsoldiers than turn out of my home and go goodness knows where. But when\\r\\nI saw them--these Prussians--it was too much for me. They made my blood\\r\\nboil with rage, and I cried the whole day for shame. Oh, if I had only\\r\\nbeen a man!--well, there! I watched them from my window--fat pigs that\\r\\nthey were with their spiked helmets--and my servant had to hold my hands\\r\\nto prevent me throwing the furniture down on the top of them. Then some\\r\\nof them came to be quartered on me, and I flew at the throat of the\\r\\nfirst one--they are not harder to strangle than any one else--and would\\r\\nhave finished him too if they had not dragged me off by the hair. Of\\r\\ncourse I had to lie low after that. So as soon as I found an opportunity\\r\\nI left--and here I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody congratulated her. She rose considerably in the estimation of\\r\\nher companions, who had not shown themselves of such valiant mettle, and\\r\\nlistening to her tale, Cornudet smiled the benignant and approving smile\\r\\nof an apostle--as a priest might on hearing a devout person praise the\\r\\nAlmighty; democrats with long beards having the monopoly of patriotism\\r\\nas the men of the cassock possess that of religion. He then took up the\\r\\nparable in a didactic tone with the phraseology culled from the notices\\r\\nposted each day on the walls, and finished up with a flourish of\\r\\neloquence in which he scathingly alluded to \"that blackguard of a\\r\\nBadinguet.\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Boule de Suif fired up at this for she was a Bonapartist. She turned\\r\\nupon him with scarlet cheeks and stammering with indignation, \"Ah! I\\r\\nshould just like to have seen any of you in his place! A nice mess you\\r\\nwould have made of it! It is men of your sort that ruined him, poor man.\\r\\nThere would be nothing for it but to leave France for good if we were\\r\\ngoverned by cowards like you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, nothing daunted, preserved a disdainful and superior smile,\\r\\nbut there was a feeling in the air that high words would soon follow,\\r\\nwhereupon the Count interposed, and managed, not without difficulty, to\\r\\nquiet the infuriated young woman by asserting authoritatively that every\\r\\nsincere opinion was to be respected. Nevertheless the Countess and the\\r\\nmanufacturer\\'s wife, who nourished in their hearts the unreasoning\\r\\nhatred of all well-bred people for the Republic and at the same time\\r\\nthat instinctive weakness of all women for uniformed and despotic\\r\\ngovernments, felt drawn, in spite of themselves, to this woman of the\\r\\nstreet who had so much sense of the fitness of things and whose opinions\\r\\nso closely resembled their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basket was empty--this had not been difficult among ten of\\r\\nthem--they only regretted it was not larger. The conversation was kept\\r\\nup for some little time longer, although somewhat more coldly after they\\r\\nhad finished eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night fell, the darkness grew gradually more profound, and the cold,\\r\\nto which digestion rendered them more sensitive, made even Boule de Suif\\r\\nshiver in spite of her fat. Madame de Breville thereupon offered her\\r\\nher charcoal foot-warmer, which had been replenished several times since\\r\\nthe morning; she accepted with alacrity, for her feet were like ice.\\r\\nMesdames Carré-Lamadon and Loiseau lent theirs to the two Sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver had lit his lanterns, which shed a vivid light over the cloud\\r\\nof vapor that hung over the steaming back of the horses and over the\\r\\nsnow at each side of the road, which seemed to open out under the\\r\\nshifting reflection of the lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the conveyance nothing could be distinguished any longer, but\\r\\nthere was a sudden movement between Boule de Suif and Cornudet, and\\r\\nLoiseau, peering through the gloom, fancied he saw the man with the\\r\\nbeard start back quickly as if he had received a well-directed but\\r\\nnoiseless blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny points of fire appeared upon the road in front. It was Totes. The\\r\\ntravelers had been driving for eleven hours, which, with the four\\r\\nhalf-hours for food and rest to the horses, made thirteen. They entered\\r\\nthe town and stopped in front of the Hotel de la Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened. A familiar sound caused every passenger to tremble--it\\r\\nwas the clink of a scabbard on the stones. At the same moment a German\\r\\nvoice called out something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the diligence had stopped, nobody attempted to get out, as\\r\\nthough they expected to be massacred on setting foot to the ground. The\\r\\ndriver then appeared holding up one of the lanterns, which suddenly\\r\\nillumined the vehicle to its farthest corner and revealed the two rows\\r\\nof bewildered faces with their open mouths and startled eyes wide with\\r\\nalarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside the driver in the full glare of the light stood a German\\r\\nofficer, a tall young man excessively slender and blonde, compressed\\r\\ninto his uniform like a girl in her stays, and wearing, well over one\\r\\near, a flat black wax-cloth cap like the \"Boots\" of an English hotel.\\r\\nHis preposterously long moustache, which was drawn out stiff and\\r\\nstraight, and tapered away indefinitely to each side till it finished\\r\\noff in a single thread so thin that it was impossible to say where it\\r\\nended, seemed to weigh upon the corners of his mouth and form a deep\\r\\nfurrow in either cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Alsatian-French and stern accents he invited the passengers to\\r\\ndescend: \"Vill you get out, chentlemen and laties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters were the first to obey with the docility of holy women\\r\\naccustomed to unfaltering submission. The Count and Countess appeared\\r\\nnext, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, and after them Loiseau\\r\\npushing his better half in front of him. As he set foot to the ground he\\r\\nremarked to the officer, more from motives of prudence than politeness,\\r\\n\"Good evening, Monsieur,\" to which the other with the insolence of the\\r\\nman in possession, vouchsafed no reply but a stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif and Cornudet, though the nearest the door, were the last\\r\\nto emerge--grave and haughty in face of the enemy. The buxom young woman\\r\\nstruggled hard to command herself and be calm; the democrat tugged at\\r\\nhis long rusty beard with a tragic and slightly trembling hand. They\\r\\nsought to preserve their dignity, realizing that in such encounters each\\r\\none, to a certain extent, represents his country; and the two being\\r\\nsimilarly disgusted at the servile readiness of their companions, she\\r\\nendeavored to show herself prouder than her fellow travelers who were\\r\\nhonest women, while he, feeling that he must set an example, continued\\r\\nin his attitude his mission of resistance begun by digging pitfalls in\\r\\nthe high roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all entered the huge kitchen of the inn, and the German, having\\r\\nbeen presented with the passport signed by the general in command--where\\r\\neach traveler\\'s name was accompanied by a personal description and a\\r\\nstatement as to his or her profession--he proceeded to scrutinize the\\r\\nparty for a long time, comparing the persons with the written notices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he exclaimed unceremoniously, \"C\\'est pien--that\\'s all right,\"\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey breathed again more freely. Hunger having reasserted itself, supper\\r\\nwas ordered. It would take half an hour to prepare, so while two\\r\\nservants were apparently busied about it the travelers dispersed to look\\r\\nat their rooms. These were all together down each side of a long passage\\r\\nending in a door with ground glass panels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, just as they were sitting down to table, the innkeeper himself\\r\\nappeared. He was a former horse-dealer, a stout asthmatic man with\\r\\nperpetual wheezings and blowings and rattlings of phlegm in his throat.\\r\\nHis father had transmitted to him the name of Follenvie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif started and turned round. \"That is my name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle, the Prussian officer wants to speak to you at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if you really are Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated, thought for a moment, and then declared roundly: \"That\\r\\nmay be, but I\\'m not going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement round about her--everybody was much exercised as to\\r\\nthe reason of this summons. The Count came over to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may do wrong to refuse, madame, for it may entail considerable\\r\\nannoyance not only to yourself but on the rest of your companions. It is\\r\\na fatal mistake ever to offer resistance to people who are stronger than\\r\\nourselves. The step can have no possible danger for you--it is probably\\r\\nabout some little formality that has been omitted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne and all concurred with him, implored and urged and scolded, till\\r\\nthey ended by convincing her; for they were all apprehensive of the\\r\\nresults of her contumacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I do it for you sure enough!\" she said at last. The Countess\\r\\npressed her hand. \"And we are most grateful to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the room, and the others agreed to wait for her before\\r\\nbeginning the meal. Each one lamented at not having been asked for\\r\\ninstead of this hot-headed, violent young woman, and mentally prepared\\r\\nany number of platitudes for the event of being called in their turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of ten minutes she returned, crimson with rage, choking,\\r\\nsnorting,--\"Oh, the blackguard; the low blackguard!\" she stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all crowded round her to know what had happened, but she would not\\r\\nsay, and the Count becoming insistent, she answered with much dignity,\\r\\n\"No, it does not concern anybody! I can\\'t speak of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then seated themselves round a great soup tureen from which steamed\\r\\na smell of cabbage. In spite of this little contretemps the supper was\\r\\na gay one. The cider, of which the Loiseaus and the two nuns partook\\r\\nfrom motives of economy, was good. The rest ordered wine and Cornudet\\r\\ncalled for beer. He had a particular way with him of uncorking the\\r\\nbottle, of making the liquid froth, of gazing at it while he tilted the\\r\\nglass, which he then held up between his eye and the light to criticise\\r\\nthe color; while he drank, his great beard, which had the tints of his\\r\\nfavorite beverage, seemed to quiver fondly, his eyes squinting that he\\r\\nmight not lose sight of his tankard for a moment, and altogether he had\\r\\nthe appearance of fulfilling the sole function for which he had been\\r\\nborn. You would have said that he established in his own mind some\\r\\nconnection or affinity between the two great passions that monopolized\\r\\nhis life--Ale and Revolution--and most assuredly he never dipped into\\r\\nthe one without thinking of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Follenvie supped at the farther end of the table.\\r\\nThe husband--puffing and blowing like a bursting locomotive--had too\\r\\nmuch cold on the chest to be able to speak and eat at the same time, but\\r\\nhis wife never ceased talking. She described her every impression at the\\r\\narrival of the Prussians and all they did and all they said, execrating\\r\\nthem in the first place because they cost so much, and secondly because\\r\\nshe had two sons in the army. She addressed herself chiefly to the\\r\\nCountess, as it flattered her to be able to say she had conversed with a\\r\\nlady of quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe presently lowered her voice and proceeded to recount some rather\\r\\ndelicate matters, her husband breaking in from time to time with--\"You\\r\\nhad much better hold your tongue, Madame Follenvie,\"--to which she paid\\r\\nnot the slightest attention, but went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, madame, as I was saying--these men, they do nothing but eat\\r\\npotatoes and pork and pork and potatoes from morning till night. And as\\r\\nfor their habits--! And you should see them exercising for hours and\\r\\ndays together out there in the fields--It\\'s forward march and backward\\r\\nmarch, and turn this way and turn that. If they even worked in the\\r\\nfields or mended the roads in their own country! But, no, madame, these\\r\\nsoldiers are no good to anybody, and the poor people have to keep them\\r\\nand feed them simply that they may learn how to massacre. I know I am\\r\\nonly a poor ignorant old woman, but when I see these men wearing\\r\\nthemselves out by tramping up and down from morning till night, I cannot\\r\\nhelp saying to myself, if there are some people who make a lot of useful\\r\\ndiscoveries, why should others give themselves so much trouble to do\\r\\nharm? After all, isn\\'t it an abomination to kill anybody, no matter\\r\\nwhether they are Prussians, or English, or Poles, or French? If you\\r\\nrevenge yourself on some one who has harmed you that is wicked, and you\\r\\nare taken up and punished; but let them shoot down our sons as if they\\r\\nwere game, and it is all right, and they give medals to the man who\\r\\nkills the most. No, no, look you, I shall never be able to see any rhyme\\r\\nor reason in that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"War is barbarous if one attacks an unoffending neighbor--it is a sacred\\r\\nduty if one defends one\\'s country,\" remarked Cornudet in a declamatory\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman nodded assent. \"Yes--defending oneself, of course, that\\r\\nis quite another thing; but wouldn\\'t it be better to kill all these\\r\\nkings who do this for their pleasure?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet\\'s eyes flashed. \"Bravo, citizeness!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon was lost in thought. Although he was an ardent\\r\\nadmirer of famous military men, the sound common sense of this peasant\\r\\nwoman\\'s observations made him reflect upon the wealth which would\\r\\nnecessarily accrue to the country if all these unemployed and\\r\\nconsequently ruinous hands--so much unproductive force--were available\\r\\nfor the great industrial works that would take centuries to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau meanwhile had left his seat and gone over beside the innkeeper,\\r\\nto whom he began talking in a low voice. The fat man laughed, coughed,\\r\\nand spat, his unwieldy stomach shaking with mirth at his neighbor\\'s\\r\\njokes, and he bought six hogsheads of claret from him for the spring\\r\\nwhen the Prussians would have cleared out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper was scarcely over when, dropping with fatigue, everybody went off\\r\\nto bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, however, who had made certain observations, let his wife go to\\r\\nbed and proceeded to glue first his ear and then his eye to the keyhole,\\r\\nendeavoring to penetrate what he called \"the mysteries of the corridor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about half an hour he heard a rustling, and hurrying to the\\r\\nkeyhole, he perceived Boule de Suif looking ampler than ever in a\\r\\ndressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She had a candle\\r\\nin her hand and was going towards the end of the corridor. Then a door\\r\\nat one side opened cautiously, and when she returned after a few\\r\\nminutes, Cornudet in his shirt sleeves was following her. They were\\r\\ntalking in a low voice and presently stood still; Boule de Suif\\r\\napparently defending the entrance of her room with much energy.\\r\\nUnfortunately Loiseau was unable to hear what they said till, at the\\r\\nlast, as they raised their voices somewhat, he caught a word or two.\\r\\nCornudet was insisting eagerly. \"Look here,\" he said, \"you are really\\r\\nvery ridiculous--what difference can it make to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she with an offended air retorted, \"No!--let me tell you there are\\r\\nmoments when that sort of thing won\\'t do; and besides--here--it would be\\r\\na crying shame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe obviously did not understand. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this she grew angry. \"Why?\" and she raised her voice still more, \"you\\r\\ndon\\'t see why? and there are Prussians in the house--in the next room\\r\\nfor all you know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply. This display of patriotic prudery evidently aroused\\r\\nhis failing dignity, for with a brief salute he made for his own door on\\r\\ntiptoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau deeply thrilled and amused, executed a double shuffle in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, donned his nightcap, and slipped into the blankets\\r\\nwhere the bony figure of his spouse already reposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole house sank to silence. But anon there arose from somewhere--it\\r\\nmight have been the cellar, it might have been the attics--impossible to\\r\\ndetermine the direction--a rumbling--sonorous, even, regular, dull,\\r\\nprolonged roar as of a boiler under high steam pressure: Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been decided that they should start at eight o\\'clock the next\\r\\nmorning, so they were all assembled in the kitchen by that hour; but the\\r\\ndiligence, roofed with snow, stood solitary in the middle of the\\r\\ncourtyard without horses or driver. The latter was sought for in vain\\r\\neither in the stables or the coachhouse. The men of the party then\\r\\nresolved to beat the country round for him, and went out accordingly.\\r\\nThey found themselves in the public square with the church at one end,\\r\\nand low-roofed houses down each side in which they caught sight of\\r\\nPrussian soldiers. The first one they came upon was peeling potatoes;\\r\\nfarther on another was washing out a barber\\'s shop; while a third,\\r\\nbearded to the eyes, was soothing a crying child and rocking it to and\\r\\nfro on his knee to quiet it. The big peasant woman whose men were all\\r\\n\"with the army in the war\" were ordering about their docile conquerors\\r\\nand showing them by signs what work they wanted done--chopping wood,\\r\\ngrinding coffee, fetching water; one of them was even doing the washing\\r\\nfor his hostess, a helpless old crone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count, much astonished, stopped the beadle, who happened to come out\\r\\nof the vestry at that moment, and asked the meaning of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" replied the old church rat, \"these are not at all bad. From what I\\r\\nhear they are not Prussians, either; they come from farther off, but\\r\\nwhere I can\\'t say; and they have all left a wife and children at home. I\\r\\nam very sure the women down there are crying for their men, too, and it\\r\\nwill all make a nice lot of misery for them as well as for us. We are\\r\\nnot so badly off here for the moment, because they do not harm and are\\r\\nworking just as if they were in their own homes. You see, Monsieur, the\\r\\npoor always help one another; it is the great people who make the\\r\\nwars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet, indignant at the friendly understanding established between\\r\\nthe victors and the vanquished, retired from the scene, preferring to\\r\\nshut himself up in the inn. Loiseau of course must have his joke. \"They\\r\\nare re-populating,\" he said. Monsieur Carré-Lamadon found a more fitting\\r\\nexpression. \"They are repairing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the driver was nowhere to be found. At last he was unearthed in the\\r\\nvillage café hobnobbing fraternally with the officer\\'s orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not have orders to have the diligence ready by eight o\\'clock?\"\\r\\nthe Count asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, but I got another order later on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not to put the horses in at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who gave you that order?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma foi--the Prussian commandant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know--you had better ask him. I am told not to harness the\\r\\nhorses, and so I don\\'t harness them--there you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he tell you so himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur, the innkeeper brought me the message from him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last night, just as I was going to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men returned much disconcerted. They asked for Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, but were informed by the servant that on account of his\\r\\nasthma he never got up before ten o\\'clock--he had even positively\\r\\nforbidden them to awaken him before then except in case of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they asked to see the officer, but that was absolutely impossible,\\r\\nalthough he lodged at the inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to approach him on non-military\\r\\nmatters. So they had to wait. The women returned to their rooms and\\r\\noccupied themselves as best they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet installed himself in the high chimney-corner of the kitchen,\\r\\nwhere a great fire was burning. He had one of the little coffee-room\\r\\ntables brought to him and a can of beer, and puffed away placidly at his\\r\\npipe, which enjoyed among the democrats almost equal consideration with\\r\\nhimself, as if in serving Cornudet it served the country also. The pipe\\r\\nwas a superb meerschaum, admirably colored, black as the teeth of its\\r\\nowner, but fragrant, curved, shining familiar to his hand, and the\\r\\nnatural complement to his physiognomy. He sat there motionless, his eyes\\r\\nfixed alternately on the flame of the hearth and the foam on the top of\\r\\nhis tankard, and each time after drinking he passed his bony fingers\\r\\nwith a self-satisfied gesture through his long greasy hair, while he\\r\\nwiped the fringe of froth from his moustache.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the pretext of stretching his legs, Loiseau went out and palmed\\r\\noff his wines on the country retail dealers. The Count and the\\r\\nmanufacturer talked politics. They forecast the future of France, the\\r\\none putting his faith in the Orleans, the other in an unknown savior, a\\r\\nhero who would come to the fore when things were at their very worst--a\\r\\nDu Guesclin, a Joan of Arc perhaps, or even another Napoleon I. Ah, if\\r\\nonly the Prince Imperial were not so young! Cornudet listened to them\\r\\nwith the smile of a man who could solve the riddle of Fate if he would.\\r\\nHis pipe perfumed the whole kitchen with its balmy fragrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stroke of ten Monsieur Follenvie made his appearance. They\\r\\ninstantly attacked him with questions, but he had but one answer which\\r\\nhe repeated two or three times without variation. \"The officer said to\\r\\nme, \\'Monsieur Follenvie, you will forbid them to harness the horses for\\r\\nthese travelers to-morrow morning. They are not to leave till I give my\\r\\npermission. You understand?\\' That is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey demanded to see the officer; the Count sent up his card, on which\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon added his name and all his titles. The Prussian\\r\\nsent word that he would admit the two men to his presence after he had\\r\\nlunched, that is to say, about one o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies came down and they all managed to eat a little in spite of\\r\\ntheir anxiety. Boule de Suif looked quite ill and very much agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were just finishing coffee when the orderly arrived to fetch the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau joined them, but when they proposed to bring Cornudet along to\\r\\ngive more solemnity to their proceedings, he declared haughtily that\\r\\nnothing would induce him to enter into any communication whatsoever with\\r\\nthe Germans, and he returned to his chimney-corner and ordered another\\r\\nbottle of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men therefore went upstairs without him, and were shown into\\r\\nthe best room of the inn, where they were received by the officer\\r\\nlolling in an armchair, his heels on the chimney-piece, smoking a long\\r\\nporcelain pipe, and arrayed in a flamboyant dressing-gown, taken, no\\r\\ndoubt, from the abandoned dwelling-house of some bourgeois of inferior\\r\\ntaste. He did not rise, he vouchsafed them no greeting of any\\r\\ndescription, he did not even look at them--a brilliant sample of the\\r\\nvictorious military cad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last after some moments waiting he said: \"Vat do you vant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count acted as spokesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We wish to leave, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking the reason for this refusal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pecause I do not shoose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all due respect, Monsieur, I would draw your attention to the fact\\r\\nthat your general gave us a permit for Dieppe, and I cannot see that we\\r\\nhave done anything to justify your hard measures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not shoose--dat\\'s all--you can co town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was miserable. They could make nothing of this caprice of\\r\\nthe German\\'s, and the most far-fetched ideas tortured their minds. The\\r\\nwhole party remained in the kitchen engaging in endless discussions,\\r\\nimagining the most improbable things. Were they to be kept as\\r\\nhostages?--but if so, to what end?--or taken prisoners--or asked a large\\r\\nransom? This last suggestion threw them into a cold perspiration of\\r\\nfear. The wealthiest were seized with the worst panic and saw themselves\\r\\nforced, if they valued their lives, to empty bags of gold into the\\r\\nrapacious hands of this soldier. They racked their brains for plausible\\r\\nlies to dissemble their riches, to pass themselves off as poor--very\\r\\npoor. Loiseau pulled off his watch-chain and hid it in his pocket. As\\r\\nnight fell their apprehensions increased. The lamp was lighted, and as\\r\\nthere were still two hours till supper Madame Loiseau proposed a game\\r\\nof \"trente et un.\" It would be some little distraction, at any rate. The\\r\\nplan was accepted; even Cornudet, who had put out his pipe from motives\\r\\nof politeness, taking a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count shuffled the cards, dealt, Boule de Suif had \"trente et un\" at\\r\\nthe first deal; and very soon the interest in the game allayed the fears\\r\\nwhich beset their minds. Cornudet, however, observed that the two\\r\\nLoiseaus were in league to cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were sitting down to the evening meal Monsieur appeared and\\r\\nsaid in his husky voice: \"The Prussian officer wishes to know if\\r\\nMademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset has not changed her mind yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif remained standing and turned very pale, then suddenly her\\r\\nface flamed and she fell into such a paroxysm of rage that she could not\\r\\nspeak. At last she burst out: \"You can tell that scoundrel--that low\\r\\nscum of a Prussian--that I won\\'t--and I never will--do you hear?--never!\\r\\nnever! never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fat innkeeper retired. They instantly surrounded Boule de Suif,\\r\\nquestioning, entreating her to disclose the mystery of her visit. At\\r\\nfirst she refused, but presently, carried away by her indignation, she\\r\\ntold them in plain terms what he demanded of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general indignation was so violent that nobody was shocked. Cornudet\\r\\nbrought his beer glass down on the table with such a bang that it broke.\\r\\nThere was a perfect babel of invective against the base wretch, a\\r\\nhurricane of wrath, a union of all for resistance, as if each had been\\r\\nrequired to contribute a portion of the sacrifice demanded of the one.\\r\\nThe Count protested with disgust that these people behaved really as if\\r\\nthey were early barbarians. The women, in particular, accorded her the\\r\\nmost lively and affectionate sympathy. The nuns, who only appeared at\\r\\nmeals, dropped their eyes and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fury of the storm having abated, they sat down to supper, but\\r\\nthere was little conversation and a good deal of thoughtful abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies retired early; the men, while they smoked, got up a game of\\r\\necarté, which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to join, as they intended\\r\\npumping him skillfully as to the means that could be employed for\\r\\novercoming the officer\\'s opposition to their departure. Unfortunately,\\r\\nhe would absorb himself wholly in his cards, and neither listened to\\r\\nwhat they said nor gave any answer to their questions, but repeated\\r\\nincessantly, \"Play, gentlemen, play!\" His attention was so deeply\\r\\nengaged that he forgot to cough, with the result of eliciting organ\\r\\ntones from his chest; his wheezing lungs running through the whole gamut\\r\\nof asthma from notes of the profoundest bass to the shrill, hoarse crow\\r\\nof the young cock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe refused to go to bed when his wife, who was dropping with sleep, came\\r\\nto fetch him. She therefore departed alone, for on her devolved the \"day\\r\\nduty,\" and she always rose with the sun, while her husband took the\\r\\n\"night day,\" and was always ready to sit up all night with friends. He\\r\\nmerely called out, \"Mind you put my chicken broth in front of the fire!\"\\r\\nand returned to his cards. When they were convinced that there was\\r\\nnothing to be got out of him, they declared that it was high time to go\\r\\nto bed, and left him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were up again pretty early the next day, filled with an indefinite\\r\\nhope, a still keener desire to be gone, and a horror of another day to\\r\\nbe got through in this odious tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! the horses were still in the stable and the coachman remained\\r\\ninvisible. For lack of something better to do, they sadly wandered round\\r\\nthe diligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLunch was very depressing, and a certain chilliness had sprung up with\\r\\nregard to Boule de Suif, for the night--which brings counsel--had\\r\\nsomewhat modified the heat of their opinions. They were almost vexed\\r\\nwith the girl now for not having gone to the Prussian secretly, and thus\\r\\nprepared a pleasant surprise for her companions in the morning. What\\r\\ncould be simpler, and, after all, who would have been any the wiser? She\\r\\nmight have saved appearances by telling the officer that she could not\\r\\nbear to see their distress any longer. It could make so very little\\r\\ndifference to her one way or another!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as yet, nobody confessed to these thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, as they were feeling bored to extinction, the Count\\r\\nproposed a walk round the village. Everybody wrapped up carefully and\\r\\nthe little party started, with the exception of Cornudet, who preferred\\r\\nsitting by the fire, and the two Sisters, who passed their days in the\\r\\nchurch or with the curé.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold--grown more intense each day--nipped their noses and ears\\r\\nviciously, and the feet became so painful that every step was anguish;\\r\\nbut when they caught sight of the open stretch of country it appeared to\\r\\nthem so appallingly lugubrious under its illimitable white covering that\\r\\nthey turned back with one accord, their hearts constricted, their\\r\\nspirits below zero. The four ladies walked in front, the three men\\r\\nfollowing a little behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, who thoroughly took in the situation, suddenly broke out, \"How\\r\\nlong was this fool of a girl going to keep them hanging on in this\\r\\nhole?\" The Count, courteous as ever, observed that one could not demand\\r\\nso painful a sacrifice of any woman--the offer must come from her.\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon remarked that if--as there was every reason to\\r\\nbelieve--the French made an offensive counter-march by way of Dieppe,\\r\\nthe collision could only take place at Totes. This reflection greatly\\r\\nalarmed the other two. \"Why not escape on foot?\" suggested Loiseau. The\\r\\nCount shrugged his shoulders. \"How can you think of such a thing in this\\r\\nsnow--and with our wives? Besides which, we should instantly be pursued,\\r\\ncaught in ten minutes, and brought back prisoners at the mercy of these\\r\\nsoldiers.\" This was incontestable--there was nothing more to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies talked dress, but a certain constraint seemed to have risen\\r\\nup between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once, at the end of the street, the officer came in sight, his\\r\\ntall figure, like a wasp in uniform, silhouetted against the dazzling\\r\\nbackground of snow, and walking with his knees well apart, with that\\r\\nmovement peculiar to the military when endeavoring to save their\\r\\ncarefully polished boots from the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn passing the ladies he bowed, but only stared contemptuously at the\\r\\nmen, who, be it said, had the dignity not to lift their hats, though\\r\\nLoiseau made a faint gesture in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif blushed up to her eyes, and the three married women felt\\r\\nit a deep humiliation to have encountered this soldier while they were\\r\\nin the company of the young woman he had treated so cavalierly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation then turned upon him, his general appearance, his face.\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon, who had known a great many officers and was\\r\\ncompetent to judge of them \"en connoisseur,\" considered this one really\\r\\nnot half bad--she even regretted that he was not French, he would have\\r\\nmade such a fascinating hussar, and would certainly have been much run\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce indoors again, they did not know what to do with themselves. Sharp\\r\\nwords were exchanged on the most insignificant pretexts. The silent\\r\\ndinner did not last long, and they shortly afterwards went to bed,\\r\\nhoping to kill time by sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came down next morning with jaded faces and tempers on the thin\\r\\nedge. The women scarcely addressed a word to Boule de Suif.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the church bell began to ring; it was for a christening. Boule\\r\\nde Suif had a child out at nurse with some peasants near Yvetot. She did\\r\\nnot see it once in a year and never gave it a thought, but the idea of\\r\\nthis baby which was going to be baptized filled her heart with sudden\\r\\nand violent tenderness for her own, and nothing would satisfy her but\\r\\nthat she should assist at the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was she gone than they all looked at one another and proceeded\\r\\nto draw up their chairs; for everybody felt that things had come to that\\r\\npoint that something must be decided upon. Loiseau had an inspiration:\\r\\nthat they should propose to the officer to keep Boule de Suif and let\\r\\nthe rest go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Follenvie undertook the mission, but returned almost\\r\\nimmediately. The German, who had some knowledge of human nature, had\\r\\nsimply turned him out of the room. He meant to retain the whole party\\r\\nso long as his desire was unsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Madame Loiseau\\'s plebeian tendencies got the better of her. \"But\\r\\nsurely we are not going to sit down calmly here and die of old age! As\\r\\nthat is her trade, I don\\'t see that she has any right to refuse one man\\r\\nmore than another. Why, she took anybody she could get in Rouen, down to\\r\\nthe very cab drivers. Oh, yes, I know it positively from the coachman of\\r\\nthe Prefecture, who bought his wine at our shop. And now, when it lies\\r\\nwith her to get us out of this scrape, she pretends to be\\r\\nparticular--the brazen hussy! For my part, I consider the officer has\\r\\nbehaved very well! He has probably not had a chance for some time, and\\r\\nthere were three here whom, no doubt, he would have preferred; but\\r\\nno--he is content to take the one who is public property. He respects\\r\\nmarried women. Remember, he is master here. He had only to say \\'I will,\\'\\r\\nand he could have taken us by force with his soldiers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little shudder ran through the other two women. Pretty little Madame\\r\\nCarré-Lamadon\\'s eyes shone and she turned rather pale as though she\\r\\nalready felt herself forcibly seized by the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men, who had been arguing the matter in a corner, now joined them.\\r\\nLoiseau, foaming with rage, was for delivering up \"the hussy\" bound hand\\r\\nand foot to the enemy. But the Count, coming of three generations of\\r\\nambassadors, and gifted with the physique of the diplomatist, was on the\\r\\nside of skill as opposed to brute force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She must be persuaded,\" he said. Whereupon they conspired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women drew up closer together, voices were lowered, and the\\r\\ndiscussion became general, each one offering his or her advice. Nothing\\r\\nwas said to shock the proprieties. The ladies, in particular, were most\\r\\nexpert in felicitous turns of phrase, charming subtleties of speech for\\r\\nexpressing the most ticklish things. A foreigner would have understood\\r\\nnothing, the language was so carefully veiled. But as the slight coating\\r\\nof modesty with which every woman of the world is enveloped is hardly\\r\\nmore than skin deep, they expanded under the influence of this equivocal\\r\\nadventure, enjoying themselves wildly at bottom, thoroughly in their\\r\\nelement, dabbling in sensuality with the gusto of an epicurean cook\\r\\npreparing a toothsome delicacy for somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story finally appeared to them so funny that they quite recovered\\r\\ntheir spirits. The Count indulged in some rather risky pleasantries, but\\r\\nso well put that they raised a responsive smile; Loiseau, in his turn,\\r\\nrapped out some decidedly strong jokes which nobody took in bad part,\\r\\nand the brutal proposition expressed by his wife swayed all their minds:\\r\\n\"As that is her trade, why refuse one man more than another?\" Little\\r\\nMadame Carré-Lamadon seemed even to think that in her place she would\\r\\nrefuse this one less readily than another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were long in preparing the blockade, as if against an invested\\r\\nfortress. Each one agreed upon the part they would play, the arguments\\r\\nthey would bring forward, the maneuvers they would execute. They\\r\\narranged the plan of attack, the stratagems to be employed, and the\\r\\nsurprises of the assault for forcing this living citadel to receive the\\r\\nenemy within its gates. Cornudet alone held aloof, completely outside\\r\\nthe affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were so profoundly occupied with the matter in hand that they never\\r\\nheard Boule de Suif enter the room. But the Count breathed a low warning\\r\\n\"Hush!\" and they lifted their heads. She was there. The talking ceased\\r\\nabruptly, and a certain feeling of embarrassment prevented them from\\r\\naddressing her at first, till the Countess, more versed than the others\\r\\nin the duplicities of the drawing-room, asked how she had enjoyed the\\r\\nchristening.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill full of emotion at what she had witnessed, Boule de Suif described\\r\\nevery detail--the people\\'s faces, their attitudes, even the appearance\\r\\nof the church. It was so nice to pray now and then, she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill luncheon, however, the ladies confined themselves merely to being\\r\\nagreeable to her in order to increase her confidence in them and her\\r\\ndocility to their counsels. But once seated at the table, the attack\\r\\nbegan. It first took the form of a desultory conversation on devotion to\\r\\na cause. Examples from ancient history were cited: Judith and\\r\\nHolofernes, and then, without any apparent connection, Lucretia and\\r\\nSextus, Cleopatra admitting to her couch all the hostile generals, and\\r\\nreducing them to the servility of slaves. Then began a fantastic\\r\\nhistory, which had sprung up in the minds of these ignorant\\r\\nmillionaires, in which the women of Rome were seen on their way to\\r\\nCapua, to rock Hannibal to sleep in their arms, and his officers along\\r\\nwith him, and the phalanxes of the mercenaries. The women were mentioned\\r\\nwho had arrested the course of conquerors, made of their bodies a\\r\\nrampart, a means of dominating, a weapon; who had vanquished by their\\r\\nheroic embraces beings hideous or repulsive, and sacrificed their\\r\\nchastity to vengeance or patriotism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this in so discreet and moderate a manner, with now and then a\\r\\nlittle burst of warm enthusiasm, admirably calculated to excite\\r\\nemulation. To hear them you would have finally come to the conclusion\\r\\nthat woman\\'s sole mission here below was to perpetually sacrifice her\\r\\nperson, to abandon herself continually to the caprices of the warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters appeared to be deaf to it all, sunk in profound thought.\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey allowed her all the afternoon for reflection, but instead of\\r\\ncalling her \"Madame,\" as they had done up till now, they addressed her\\r\\nsimply as \"Mademoiselle\"--nobody could have said exactly why--as if to\\r\\nsend her down a step in the esteem she had gained, and force her to feel\\r\\nthe shame of her position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening just as the soup was being brought to the table Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie made his appearance again with the same message as before:\\r\\n\"The Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elizabeth Rousset if she\\r\\nhad not changed her mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Monsieur,\" Boule de Suif replied curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt supper the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three jokes that hung\\r\\nfire; everybody beat their brains for fresh instances to the point; and\\r\\nfound none, when the Countess, possibly without premeditation and only\\r\\nfrom a vague desire to render homage to religion, interrogated the older\\r\\nof the two Sisters on the main incidents in the lives of the saints.\\r\\nNow, several of them had committed acts which would be counted crimes in\\r\\nour eyes, but the Church readily pardons such misdeeds when they are\\r\\naccomplished for the glory of God or the benefit of our neighbors. Then\\r\\nby one of those tacit agreements, those veiled complaisances in which\\r\\nevery one who wears ecclesiastical habit excels, or perhaps simply from\\r\\na happy want of intelligence, a helpful stupidity, the old nun brought\\r\\nformidable support to the conspiracy. They had imagined her timid; she\\r\\nproved herself bold, verbose, violent. She was not troubled by any of\\r\\nthe shilly-shallyings of casuistry, her doctrine was like a bar of iron,\\r\\nher faith never wavered, her conscience knew no scruples. She considered\\r\\nAbraham\\'s sacrifice a very simple affair, for she herself would have\\r\\ninstantly killed father or mother at an order from above, and nothing,\\r\\nshe averred, could displease the Lord if the intention were commendable.\\r\\nThe Countess, taking advantage of the sacred authority of her unexpected\\r\\nally, drew her on to make an edifying paraphrase, as it were, on the\\r\\nwell-known moral maxim: \"The end justifies the means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, Sister,\" she inquired, \"you think God approves of every pathway\\r\\nthat leads to Him, and pardons the deed if the motive be a pure one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who can doubt it, Madame? An action blamable in itself is often\\r\\nrendered meritorious by the impulse which inspires it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she continued in the same strain, unraveling the intricacies of the\\r\\nwill of the Almighty, predicting His decisions, making Him interest\\r\\nHimself in matters which, of a truth, did not concern Him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was skillfully and discreetly wrapped up, but each word of the\\r\\npious woman in the big white cap made a breach in the indignant\\r\\nresistance of the courtesan. The conversation then glancing off\\r\\nslightly, the woman of the pendent rosaries went on to speak of the\\r\\nreligious houses of her Order, of her superior, of herself and her\\r\\nfragile little companion, her dear little Sister St. Nicephora. They\\r\\nhad been sent for to Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers there down\\r\\nwith small-pox. She described the condition of these poor wretches, gave\\r\\ndetails of their disorder; and while they were thus stopped upon the\\r\\nroad by the whim of this Prussian, many French soldiers might die whom\\r\\nperhaps they could have saved. That was her specialty--nursing soldiers.\\r\\nShe had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and relating her\\r\\ncampaigns, she suddenly revealed herself as one of those Sisters of the\\r\\nfife and drum who seem made for following the camp, picking up the\\r\\nwounded in the thick of battle, and better than any officer for quelling\\r\\nwith a word the great hulking undisciplined recruits--a regular Sister\\r\\nRataplan, her ravaged face all riddled with pits, calling up an image of\\r\\nthe devastations of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke after her for fear of spoiling the excellent effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after dinner they hurried to their rooms, not to reappear\\r\\ntill pretty late the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuncheon passed off quietly. They allowed the seed sown yesterday time\\r\\nto grow and bear fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the Countess proposed a walk, whereupon the Count,\\r\\nfollowing the preconcerted arrangement, took Boule de Suif\\'s arm and\\r\\nfell behind with her a little. He adopted that familiar, paternal,\\r\\nsomewhat contemptuous tone which elderly men affect towards such girls,\\r\\ncalling her \"my dear child,\" treating her from the height of his social\\r\\nposition and indisputable respectability.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came to the point without further preamble. \"So you prefer to keep us\\r\\nhere exposed like yourself to all the violence which must inevitably\\r\\nfollow a check to the Prussian arms, rather than consent to accord one\\r\\nof those favors you have so often dispensed in your time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif did not reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then appealed to her kindness of heart, her reason, her sentiment. He\\r\\nknew how to remain \"Monsieur le Comte,\" yet showing himself at the same\\r\\ntime chivalrous, flattering--in a word, altogether amiable. He exalted\\r\\nthe sacrifice she would be making for them, touched upon their\\r\\ngratitude, and with a final flash of roguishness, \"Besides, my dear, he\\r\\nmay think himself lucky--he will not find many such pretty girls as you\\r\\nin his own country!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoule de Suif said nothing and rejoined the rest of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned, she went straight to her room and did not come down\\r\\nagain. The anxiety was terrible. What was she going to do? How\\r\\nunspeakably mortifying if she still persisted in her refusal!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, they waited for her in vain. Monsieur\\r\\nFollenvie, entering presently, announced that Mademoiselle Rousset was\\r\\nindisposed, and that there was consequently no need to delay supper any\\r\\nlonger. They all pricked up their ears. The Countess approached the\\r\\ninnkeeper with a whispered \"All right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor propriety\\'s sake he said nothing to his companions, but he made them\\r\\na slight sign of the head. A great sigh of relief went up from every\\r\\nheart, every face lit up with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Saperlipopette!\" cried Loiseau, \"I will stand champagne if there is\\r\\nsuch a thing in this establishment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Loiseau suffered a pang of anguish when the innkeeper returned\\r\\nwith four bottles in his hands. Everybody suddenly turned communicative\\r\\nand cheerful, and their hearts overflowed with brotherly love. The Count\\r\\nseemed all at once to become aware that Madame Carré-Lamadon was\\r\\ncharming; the manufacturer paid compliments to the Countess.\\r\\nConversation became lively, sprightly, and full of sparkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the repast the women themselves were indulging in\\r\\ndecidedly risky witticisms. Eyes grew bright, tongues were loosened, a\\r\\ngood deal of wine had been consumed. The Count, who, even in his cups,\\r\\nretained his characteristic air of diplomatic gravity, made some highly\\r\\nspiced comparisons on the subject of the end of the winter season at the\\r\\nPole and the joy of ice-bound mariners at sight of an opening to the\\r\\nsouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoiseau, now in full swing, rose, and lifting high his glass of\\r\\nchampagne, \"To our deliverance!\" he cried. Everybody started to their\\r\\nfeet with acclamation. Even the two Sisters of Mercy, yielding to the\\r\\nsolicitations of the ladies, consented to take a sip of the effervescing\\r\\nwine which they had never tasted before. They pronounced it to be very\\r\\nlike lemonade, though, on the whole, more refined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity there is no piano,\" said Loiseau as a crowning point to the\\r\\nsituation, \"we might have finished up with a little hop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet had not uttered a word, nor made a sign of joining in the\\r\\ngeneral hilarity; he was apparently plunged in the gravest abstractions,\\r\\nonly pulling viciously at his great beard from time to time as if to\\r\\ndraw it out longer than before. At last, about midnight, when the\\r\\ncompany was preparing to separate, Loiseau came hiccoughing over to\\r\\nhim, and digging him in the ribs: \"You seem rather down in the mouth\\r\\nthis evening, citizen--haven\\'t said a word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet threw up his head angrily, and sweeping the company with a\\r\\nflashing and terrible look: \"I tell you all that what you have done\\r\\nto-day is an infamy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose, made his way to the door, exclaimed once again, \"An infamy!\"\\r\\nand vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis somewhat dashed their spirits for the moment. Loiseau, nonplussed\\r\\nat first, soon regained his aplomb and burst into a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\"Sour grapes, old man--sour grapes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others not understanding the allusion, he proceeded to relate the\\r\\n\"mysteries of the corridor.\" This was followed by an uproarious revival\\r\\nof gayety. The ladies were in a frenzy of delight, the Count and\\r\\nMonsieur Carré-Lamadon laughed till they cried. They could not believe\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say he wanted--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you I saw it with my own eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because the Prussian was in the next room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is incredible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As true as I stand here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count nearly choked; the manufacturer held both his sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you can understand that he does not quite see the joke of the thing\\r\\nthis evening--oh, no--not at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they all three went off again, breathless, choking, sick with\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that they parted for the night. But Madame Loiseau remarked to her\\r\\nhusband when they were alone that that little cat of a Carré-Lamadon\\r\\nhad laughed on the wrong side of her mouth all the evening. \"You know\\r\\nhow it is with these women--they dote upon a uniform, and whether it is\\r\\nFrench or Prussian matters precious little to them. But, Lord--it seems\\r\\nto me a poor way of looking at things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently nobody got much sleep that night, for it was long before the\\r\\nlights ceased to shine under the doors. Champagne, they say, often has\\r\\nthat disturbing effect; it makes one restless and wakeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning a brilliant winter sun shone on the dazzling snow. The\\r\\ndiligence was by this time ready and waiting before the door, while a\\r\\nflock of white pigeons, muffled in their thick plumage, strutted\\r\\nsolemnly in and out among the feet of the six horses, seeking what they\\r\\nmight devour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver, enveloped in his sheepskin, sat on the box smoking his pipe,\\r\\nand the radiant travelers were busily laying in provisions for the rest\\r\\nof the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were only waiting now for Boule de Suif. She appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked agitated and downcast as she advanced timidly towards her\\r\\nfellow travelers, who all, with one movement, turned away their heads as\\r\\nif they had not seen her. The Count, with a dignified movement, took his\\r\\nwife by the arm and drew her away from this contaminating contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor thing stopped short, bewildered; then gathering up her courage\\r\\nshe accosted the wife of the manufacturer with a humble \"Good morning,\\r\\nMadame.\" The other merely replied with an impertinent little nod,\\r\\naccompanied by a stare of outraged virtue. Everybody seemed suddenly\\r\\nextremely busy, and they avoided her as if she had brought the plague\\r\\nin her skirts. They then precipitated themselves into the vehicle, where\\r\\nshe arrived the last and by herself, and resumed in silence the seat she\\r\\nhad occupied during the first part of the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey affected not to see her, not to recognize her; only Madame Loiseau,\\r\\nglancing round at her with scorn and indignation, said half audibly to\\r\\nher husband, \"It\\'s a good thing that I am not sitting beside her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy conveyance jolted off, and the journey recommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one spoke for the first little while. Boule de Suif did not venture\\r\\nto raise her eyes. She felt incensed at her companions, and at the same\\r\\ntime deeply humiliated at having yielded to their persuasions, and let\\r\\nherself be sullied by the kisses of this Prussian into whose arms they\\r\\nhad hypocritically thrust her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess was the first to break the uncomfortable silence. Turning\\r\\nto Madame Carré-Lamadon, she said, \"You know Madame d\\'Etrelles, I\\r\\nthink?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; she is a great friend of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming woman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fascinating! So truly refined; very cultivated, too, and an artist to\\r\\nthe tips of her fingers--she sings delightfully, and draws to\\r\\nperfection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manufacturer was talking to the Count, and through the rattle\\r\\nof the crazy windowpanes one caught a word here and there;\\r\\nshares--dividends--premium--settling day--and the like. Loiseau, who had\\r\\nappropriated an old pack of cards from the inn, thick with the grease of\\r\\nthe five years\\' rubbing on dirty tables, started a game of bezique with\\r\\nhis wife. The two Sisters pulled up the long rosaries hanging at their\\r\\nwaists, made the sign of the cross, and suddenly began moving their lips\\r\\nrapidly, faster and faster, hurrying their vague babble as if for a\\r\\nwager; kissing a medal from time to time, crossing themselves again, and\\r\\nthen resuming their rapid and monotonous murmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornudet sat motionless--thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the three hours\\' steady traveling Loiseau gathered up his\\r\\ncards and remarked facetiously, \"It\\'s turning hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife then produced a parcel, which she untied, and brought out a\\r\\npiece of cold veal. This she cut up into thin, firm slices, and both\\r\\nbegan to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supposing we do the same?\" said the Countess, and proceeded to unpack\\r\\nthe provisions prepared for both couples. In one of those oblong dishes\\r\\nwith a china hare upon the cover to indicate that a roast hare lies\\r\\nbeneath, was a succulent selection of cold viands--brown slices of juicy\\r\\nvenison mingled with other meats. A delicious square of gruyere cheese\\r\\nwrapped in newspaper still bore imprinted on its dewy surface the words\\r\\n\"General News.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Sisters brought out a sausage smelling of garlic, and Cornudet,\\r\\nplunging his hands into the vast pockets of his loose greatcoat, drew up\\r\\nfour hard-boiled eggs from one and a big crust of bread from the other.\\r\\nHe peeled off the shells and threw them into the straw under his feet,\\r\\nand proceeded to bite into the egg, dropping pieces of the yolk into his\\r\\nlong beard, from whence they shone out like stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hurry and confusion of the morning Boule de Suif had omitted to\\r\\ntake thought for the future, and she looked on, furious, choking with\\r\\nmortification, at these people all munching away so placidly. A storm\\r\\nof rage convulsed her, and she opened her mouth to hurl at them the\\r\\ntorrent of abuse that rose to her lips, but she could not speak,\\r\\nsuffocated by her indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody looked at her, nobody thought of her. She felt herself drowning\\r\\nin the flood of contempt shown towards her by these honest scoundrels\\r\\nwho had first sacrificed her and then cast her off like some useless and\\r\\nunclean thing. Then her thoughts reverted to her great basket full of\\r\\ngood things which they had so greedily devoured--the two fowls in their\\r\\nglittering coat of jelly, her patties, her pears, her four bottles of\\r\\nclaret; and her fury suddenly subsided like the breaking of an\\r\\noverstrung chord and she felt that she was on the verge of tears. She\\r\\nmade the most strenuous efforts to overcome it--straightened herself up\\r\\nand choked back her sobs as children do, but the tears would rise. They\\r\\nglittered for a moment on her lashes, and presently two big drops rolled\\r\\nslowly over her cheeks. Others gathered in quick succession like water\\r\\ndripping from a rock and splashed onto the ample curve of her bosom. She\\r\\nsat up very straight, her eyes fixed, her face pale and rigid, hoping\\r\\nthat nobody would notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Countess saw her and nudged her husband. He shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders as much as to say, \"What can you expect? It is not my fault.\"\\r\\nMadame Loiseau gave a silent chuckle of triumph and murmured, \"She is\\r\\ncrying for shame.\" The two Sisters had resumed their devotions after\\r\\ncarefully wrapping up the remnants of their sausages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Cornudet, while digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under\\r\\nthe opposite seat, leaned back, smiled like a man who has just thought\\r\\nof a capital joke, and began to softly whistle the Marseillaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe faces clouded; the popular air seemed unpleasing to his neighbors;\\r\\nthey became nervous--irritable--looking as if they were ready to throw\\r\\nback their heads and howl like dogs at the sound of a barrel organ. He\\r\\nwas perfectly aware of this, but did not stop. From time to time he\\r\\nhummed a few of the words: \"Liberty, cherished liberty, Fight thou on\\r\\nthe side of thy defenders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove at a much quicker pace to-day, the snow being harder; and all\\r\\nthe way to Dieppe, during the long, dull hours of the journey, through\\r\\nall the jolting and rattling of the conveyance, in the falling shades of\\r\\nevening and later in the profound darkness, he continued with unabated\\r\\npersistency his vengeful and monotonous whistling; forcing his wearied\\r\\nand exasperated fellow travelers to follow the song from end to end and\\r\\nto remember every word that corresponded to each note.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Boule de Suif wept on, and at times a sob which she could not\\r\\nrepress broke out between two couplets in the darkness.',\n"," 'MISS HARRIET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were seven of us in a break, four women and three men, one of\\r\\nwhich latter was on the box seat beside the coachman, and we were\\r\\nfollowing, at a foot pace, the broad highway which serpentines along the\\r\\ncoast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting out from Etretat at break of day, in order to visit the ruins of\\r\\nTancarville, we were still asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the\\r\\nmorning. The women, especially, who were little accustomed to these\\r\\nearly excursions, let their eyelids fall and rise every moment, nodding\\r\\ntheir heads or yawning, quite insensible to the emotion of the breaking\\r\\nof day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was autumn. On both sides of the road, the bare fields stretched out,\\r\\nyellowed by the corn and wheat stubble which covered the soil, like a\\r\\nbeard that had been badly shaved. The spongy earth seemed to smoke. The\\r\\nlarks were singing, high up in the air, while other birds piped in the\\r\\nbushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun rose at length in front of us, a bright red on the plane of the\\r\\nhorizon; and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute\\r\\nto minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself,\\r\\nstretch itself, like a young girl who is leaving her bed, in her white\\r\\nvapor chemise. The Count of Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look! look! a hare!\" and he extended his arm towards the left, pointing\\r\\nto a piece of hedge. The animal threaded its way along, almost concealed\\r\\nby the field, raising only its large ears. Then it swerved across a\\r\\ndeep rut, stopped, pursued again its easy course, changed its direction,\\r\\nstopped anew, disturbed, spying out every danger, undecided as to the\\r\\nroute it should take; when suddenly it began to run with great bounds of\\r\\nthe hind legs, disappearing finally, in a large patch of beet-root. All\\r\\nthe men had woke up to watch the course of the beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené Lemanoir then exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not at all gallant this morning,\" and regarding his neighbor,\\r\\nthe little Baroness of Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he said to\\r\\nher in a subdued voice: \"You are thinking of your husband, Baroness.\\r\\nReassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you have still\\r\\nfour days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded to him with a sleepy smile: \"How rude you are.\" Then,\\r\\nshaking off her torpor, she added: \"Now, let somebody say something that\\r\\nwill make us all laugh. You, Monsieur Chenal, who have the reputation of\\r\\npossessing a larger fortune than the Duke of Richelieu, tell us a love\\r\\nstory in which you have been mixed up, anything you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very\\r\\nstrong, very proud of his physique, and very amiable, took his long\\r\\nwhite beard in his hand and smiled, then, after a few moments\\'\\r\\nreflection, he became suddenly grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale; for I am going to relate to you\\r\\nthe most lamentable love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that\\r\\nnone of my friends have ever passed through a similar experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at the time twenty-five years of age, and I was making daubs along\\r\\nthe coast of Normandy. I call \"making daubs\" that wandering about, with\\r\\na bag on one\\'s back, from mountain to mountain, under the pretext of\\r\\nstudying and of sketching nature. I know nothing more enjoyable than\\r\\nthat happy-go-lucky wandering life, in which one is perfectly free,\\r\\nwithout shackles of any kind, without care, without preoccupation,\\r\\nwithout thinking even of to-morrow. One goes in any direction one\\r\\npleases, without any guide, save his fancy, without any counselor save\\r\\nhis eyes. One pulls up, because a running brook seduces one, because one\\r\\nis attracted, in front of an inn, by the smell of potatoes frying.\\r\\nSometimes it is the perfume of clematis which decides one in his choice,\\r\\nor the naïve glance of the servant at an inn. Do not despise me for my\\r\\naffection for these rustics. These girls have a soul as well as feeling,\\r\\nnot to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips; while their hearty and\\r\\nwilling kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love always has its price,\\r\\ncome whence it may. A heart that beats when you make your appearance, an\\r\\neye that weeps when you go away, are things so rare, so sweet, so\\r\\nprecious, that they must never be despised.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had rendezvoux in ditches in which cattle repose, and in barns\\r\\namong the straw, still steaming from the heat of the day. I have\\r\\nrecollections of canvas being spread on rude and elastic benches, and of\\r\\nhearty and fresh, free kisses, more delicate and unaffectedly sincere\\r\\nthan the subtle attractions of charming and distinguished women.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what one loves most amidst all these varied adventures is the\\r\\ncountry, the woods, the risings of the sun, the twilight, the light of\\r\\nthe moon. These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with nature. One\\r\\nis alone with her in that long and tranquil rendezvous. You go to bed in\\r\\nthe fields, amidst marguerites and wild poppies, and, with eyes wide\\r\\nopen, you watch the going down of the sun, and descry in the distance\\r\\nthe little village, with its pointed clock tower, which sounds the hour\\r\\nof midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out from the foot of\\r\\nan oak, amidst a covering of fragile herbs, upright and redolent of\\r\\nlife. You go down on your knees, bend forward, you drink that cold and\\r\\npellucid water which wets your moustache and nose, you drink it with a\\r\\nphysical pleasure, as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip.\\r\\nSometimes, when you encounter a deep hole, along the course of these\\r\\ntiny brooks, you plunge into it, quite naked, and you feel on your skin,\\r\\nfrom head to foot, like an icy and delicious caress, the lovely and\\r\\ngentle quivering of the current.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are gay on the hills, melancholy on the verge of pools, exalted when\\r\\nthe sun is crowned in an ocean of blood-red shadows, and when it casts\\r\\non the rivers its red reflection. And, at night, under the moon, which\\r\\npasses across the vault of heaven, you think of things, and singular\\r\\nthings, which would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant\\r\\nlight of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, in wandering through the same country where we are this year, I came\\r\\nto the little village of Benouville, on the Falaise, between Yport and\\r\\nEtretat. I came from Fécamp, following the coast, a high coast, and as\\r\\nperpendicular as a wall, with its projecting and rugged rocks falling\\r\\nperpendicularly into the sea. I had walked since the morning on the\\r\\nshaven grass, as smooth and as yielding as a carpet. And singing\\r\\nlustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow and\\r\\nambling flight of a gull, with its short, white wings, sailing in the\\r\\nblue heavens, sometimes on the green sea, at the brown sails of a\\r\\nfishing bark. In short, I had passed a happy day, a day of listlessness\\r\\nand of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was shown a little farm house, where travelers were put up, a kind of\\r\\ninn, kept by a peasant, which stood in the center of a Norman court,\\r\\nwhich was surrounded by a double row of beeches.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuitting the Falaise, I gained the hamlet, which was hemmed in by great\\r\\ntrees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old, wrinkled and austere rustic, who seemed always to\\r\\nsuccumb to the pressure of new customs with a kind of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the month of May: the spreading apple-trees covered the court\\r\\nwith a whirling shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon\\r\\npeople and upon the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Madame Lecacheur, have you a room for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAstonished to find that I knew her name, she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That depends; everything is let; but, all the same, there will be no\\r\\nharm in looking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five minutes we were in perfect accord, and I deposited my bag upon\\r\\nthe bare floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs, a\\r\\ntable, and a wash-stand. The room looked into the large and smoky\\r\\nkitchen, where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm\\r\\nand the farmer, who was a widower.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman fricasseed a\\r\\nchicken for dinner in a large fireplace, in which hung the stew pot,\\r\\nblack with smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have travelers, then, at the present time?\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered, in an offended tone of voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a lady, an English lady, who has attained to years of maturity.\\r\\nShe is going to occupy my other room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of\\r\\ndining out in the court when the weather was fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cover was then placed in front of the door, and I commenced to gnaw\\r\\nwith my teeth the lean members of the Normandy chicken, to drink the\\r\\nclear cider, and to munch the hunk of white bread, which was four days\\r\\nold, though excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, the wooden barrier which gave into the highway, was opened,\\r\\nand a strange person directed her steps towards the house. She was very\\r\\nslender, very tall, enveloped in a Scotch shawl with red borders, and\\r\\none might have believed that she had no arms, if one had not seen a long\\r\\nhand appear just above the haunches, holding a white tourist umbrella.\\r\\nThe face of a mummy, surrounded with sausage rolls of plaited, gray\\r\\nhair, which bounded at every step she took, made me think, I know not\\r\\nwhy, of a sour herring adorned with curling papers. Lowering her eyes,\\r\\nshe passed quickly in front of me, and entered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat singular apparition made me yearn. She undoubtedly was my\\r\\nneighbor, the aged English lady of whom our hostess had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had installed\\r\\nmyself to commence painting, at the end of that beautiful valley, which\\r\\nyou know, and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, in lifting\\r\\nmy eyes suddenly, something singularly attired, standing on the crest of\\r\\nthe declivity; one might indeed say, a pole decked out with flags. It\\r\\nwas she. On seeing me, she suddenly disappeared. I re-entered the house\\r\\nat midday for lunch, and took my seat at the common table, so as to make\\r\\nthe acquaintance of this old original. But she did not respond to my\\r\\npolite advances, was insensible even to my little attentions. I poured\\r\\nwater out for her with great alacrity; I passed her the dishes with\\r\\ngreat eagerness. A slight, almost imperceptible movement of the head,\\r\\nand an English word, murmured so low that I did not understand it, were\\r\\nher only acknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ceased occupying myself with her, although she had disturbed my\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three days, I knew as much about her as did Madame\\r\\nLecacheur herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in which to\\r\\npass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville, some six months\\r\\nbefore, and did not seem disposed to quit it. She never spoke at table,\\r\\nate rapidly, reading all the while a small book, treating of some\\r\\nprotestant propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The curé\\r\\nhimself had received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to\\r\\nwhom she had paid two sous\\' commission. She said sometimes to our\\r\\nhostess, abruptly, without preparing her in the least for the\\r\\ndeclaration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love the Savior more than all; I admire him in all creation; I adore\\r\\nhim in all nature, I carry him always in my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she would immediately present the old woman with one of her\\r\\nbrochures which were destined to convert the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster had declared\\r\\nthat she was an atheist, and that a kind of reprobation weighed down on\\r\\nher. The curé, who had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner, and I\\r\\nbelieve her to be a person of pure morals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, \"Atheist,\" \"Heretic,\" words which no one can precisely\\r\\ndefine, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that\\r\\nthis English woman was rich, and that she had passed her life in\\r\\ntraveling through every country in the world, because her family had\\r\\nthrown her off. Why had her family thrown her off. Because of her\\r\\nnatural impiety?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles, one of\\r\\nthose opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many, one of\\r\\nthose good and insupportable old women who haunt the table d\\'hôtes of\\r\\nevery hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, impoison Switzerland, render the\\r\\ncharming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere\\r\\ntheir fantastic manias, their petrified vestal manners, their\\r\\nindescribable toilettes and a certain odor of India rubber, which makes\\r\\none believe that at night they slip themselves into a case of that\\r\\nmaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I encounter one of these people some fine day in a hotel, I act\\r\\nlike the birds, who see a manakin in a field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis woman, however, appeared so singular that she did not displease me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not rustic,\\r\\nfelt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic extravagances\\r\\nof the old girl. She had found a phrase by which to describe her, a\\r\\nphrase assuredly contemptible, which she had got, I know not whence,\\r\\nupon her lips, invented by I know not what confused and mysterious\\r\\ntravail of soul. She said: \"That woman is a demoniac.\" This phrase,\\r\\nculled by that austere and sentimental creature, seemed to me\\r\\nirresistibly comic. I myself, never called her now anything else, but\\r\\n\"the demoniac,\" exercising a singular pleasure in pronouncing aloud this\\r\\nword on perceiving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would ask Mother Lecacheur: \"Well, what is our demoniac about to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which my rustic friend responded, with an air of having been\\r\\nscandalized:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think, sir, she has picked up a toad which has had its paw\\r\\nbattered, and carried it to her room, and has put it in her wash-stand,\\r\\nand dressed it up like a man. If that is not profanation, I should like\\r\\nto know what is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another occasion, when walking along the Falaise, she had bought a\\r\\nlarge fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the\\r\\nsea again. The sailor, from whom she had bought it, though paid\\r\\nhandsomely, was greatly provoked at this act, more exasperated, indeed,\\r\\nthan if she had put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For a\\r\\nwhole month he could not speak of the circumstance without getting into\\r\\na fury and denouncing it as an outrage. Oh yes! She was indeed a\\r\\ndemoniac, this Miss Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an\\r\\ninspiration of genius in thus christening her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stable-boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in Africa\\r\\nin his youth, entertained other aversions. He said, with a roguish air:\\r\\n\"She is an old hag who has lived her days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the poor woman had but known!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little, kind-hearted Céleste, did not wait upon her willingly, but I\\r\\nwas never able to understand why. Probably, her only reason was that she\\r\\nwas a stranger, of another race, of a different tongue, and of another\\r\\nreligion. She was, in good truth, a demoniac!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and searching\\r\\nfor God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster of\\r\\nbushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed\\r\\naside the branches and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused\\r\\nat having been found thus, fixed on me eyes as terrible as those of a\\r\\nwild cat, surprised in open day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly descry\\r\\nher on the banks of the Falaise like a semaphore signal. She\\r\\npassionately gazed at the vast sea, glittering in the sunlight, and the\\r\\nboundless sky empurpled with fire. Sometimes I would distinguish her at\\r\\nthe bottom of a valley, walking quickly, with an English, elastic step;\\r\\nand I would go towards her, attracted I know not by what, simply to see\\r\\nher illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed\\r\\nto glow with interior and profound happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would often encounter her also in the corner of a field sitting on the\\r\\ngrass, under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little Bible lying\\r\\nopen on her knee, which she looked at meditatively at the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could no longer tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,\\r\\nbeing bound to it by a thousand links of love for its sweeping and soft\\r\\nlandscapes. At this farm I was unknown to the world, far removed from\\r\\neverything, but in close proximity to the soil, the good, healthy,\\r\\nbeautiful and green soil. And, must I avow it; there was something\\r\\nbesides curiosity which retained me at the residence of Mother\\r\\nLecacheur. I wished to become acquainted a little with this strange Miss\\r\\nHarriet, and to know what passed in the solitary souls of those\\r\\nwandering old, English dames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just finished a\\r\\nstudy, which appeared to me to display play brain power; and so it must,\\r\\nas it was sold for ten thousand francs, fifteen years later. It was as\\r\\nsimple, however, as that two and two make four, and had nothing to do\\r\\nwith academic rules. The whole of the right side of my canvas\\r\\nrepresented a rock, an enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown,\\r\\nyellow, and red, across which the sun poured like a stream of oil. The\\r\\nlight, without which one could see the stars concealed in the back\\r\\nground, fell upon the stone, and gilded it as if by fire. That was all.\\r\\nA first stupid attempt at dealing with light, burning rays, the sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea, but a\\r\\njade of a sea, as greenish, milky and thick as the overcast sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I\\r\\ncarried it back to the inn. I had wished that the whole world could have\\r\\nseen it at one and the same moment. I can remember that I showed it to a\\r\\ncow, which was browsing by the wayside, exclaiming at the same time:\\r\\n\"Look at that, my old beauty, you shall not often see its like again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the front of the house, I immediately called out to\\r\\nMother Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ohè! Ohè! my mistress, come here and look at this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rustic advanced and regarded my work with her stupid eyes which\\r\\ndistinguished nothing, and which did not even recognize whether the\\r\\npicture was the representation of an ox or a house.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet returned to the house, and she passed in rear of me just at\\r\\nthe moment when, holding out my canvas at arm\\'s length, I was exhibiting\\r\\nit to the female innkeeper. The demoniac could not help but see it, for\\r\\nI took care to exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape\\r\\nher notice. She stopped abruptly and stood motionless, stupefied. It was\\r\\nher rock which was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her\\r\\ntime undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a British \"Aoh,\" which was at once so accentuated and so\\r\\nflattering, that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my last work, Mademoiselle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe murmured ecstatically, comically and tenderly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Monsieur, you must understand what it is to have a palpitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI colored up, of course, and was more excited by that compliment than if\\r\\nit had come from a queen. I was seduced, conquered, vanquished. I could\\r\\nhave embraced her; upon my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a seat at the table beside her, as I had always done. For the\\r\\nfirst time, she spoke, drawling out in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I love nature so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI offered her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted these\\r\\nwith the vacant smile of a mummy. I then began to converse with her\\r\\nabout the scenery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the meal, we rose from the table together and we walked leisurely\\r\\nacross the court; then, being attracted by the fiery glow which the\\r\\nsetting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the outside gate\\r\\nwhich opened in the direction of the Falaise, and we walked on side by\\r\\nside, as satisfied as any two persons could be, who have just learned to\\r\\nunderstand and penetrate each other\\'s motives and feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a muggy, relaxing evening, one of those enjoyable evenings, which\\r\\nimpart happiness to mind and body alike. All is joy, all is charm. The\\r\\nluscious and balmy air, loaded with the perfumes of herbs, the perfumes\\r\\nof grass-wrack, which caresses the odor of the wild flowers, caresses\\r\\nthe potato with its marine flavor, caresses the soul with a penetrating\\r\\nsweetness. We were going to the brink of the abyss, which overlooked\\r\\nthe vast sea, and which rolled past us at the distance of less than a\\r\\nhundred meters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we drank with open mouth and expanded chest that fresh breath which\\r\\ncame from the ocean and which glided slowly over the skin, salted by its\\r\\nlong contact with the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrapped up in her square shawl, inspired by the balmy air and with teeth\\r\\nfirmly set, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball, as it\\r\\ndescended towards the sea. Soon its rim touched the waters, just in rear\\r\\nof a ship which appeared on the horizon, until, by degrees, it was\\r\\nswallowed up by the ocean. It was seen to plunge, diminish, and finally\\r\\nto disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harriet contemplated with a passionate regard the last glimmer of\\r\\nthe flaming orb of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe muttered: \"Aoh! I loved ... I loved ...\" I saw a tear start in her\\r\\neye. She continued: \"I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount\\r\\nup into the firmament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on the\\r\\nriver\\'s banks, her face as red as her purple shawl. I should have liked\\r\\nto have sketched her in my album. It would have been an ecstatic\\r\\ncaricature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned my face away from her so as to be able to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then spoke to her of painting, as I would have done to a fellow\\r\\nartist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the\\r\\nprofession. She listened attentively to me, eagerly seeking to define\\r\\nthe sense of the obscure words, so as to penetrate my thoughts. From\\r\\ntime to time, she would exclaim: \"Oh! I understand, I understand. This\\r\\nhas been very interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, on seeing me, she approached me eagerly, holding out her\\r\\nhand; and we became firm friends immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a brave creature who had a kind of elastic soul, which became\\r\\nenthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium, like all women who are\\r\\nspinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be pickled in vinegar\\r\\ninnocence, though her heart still retained something of youth and of\\r\\ngirlish effervescence. She loved both nature and animals with a fervent\\r\\nardor, a love like old wine, fermented through age, with a sensual love\\r\\nthat she had never bestowed on men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is certain, that a bitch in pup, a mare roaming in a meadow\\r\\nwith a foal at its side, a bird\\'s nest full of young ones, squeaking,\\r\\nwith their open mouths and enormous heads, made her quiver with the most\\r\\nviolent emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor solitary beings! Tristias and wanderers from table d\\'hôte to table\\r\\nd\\'hôte, poor beings, ridiculous and lamentable. I love you ever since I\\r\\nbecame acquainted with Miss Harriet!\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me, but\\r\\nshe dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in\\r\\nthe morning with my box on my back, she accompanied me as far as the end\\r\\nof the village, silent, but evidently struggling inwardly to find words\\r\\nwith which to begin a conversation. Then she left me abruptly, and, with\\r\\na jaunty step, walked away quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, however, she plucked up courage:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would like to see how you paint pictures? Will you? I have been very\\r\\ncurious.\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she colored up as though she had given utterance to words extremely\\r\\naudacious.\\r\\n\\r\\nI conducted her to the bottom of the Petit-Val, where I had commenced a\\r\\nlarge picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained standing near me, following all my gestures with\\r\\nconcentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing, perhaps, that she was\\r\\ndisturbing me she said to me: \"Thank you,\" and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a short time she became more familiar, and accompanied me every\\r\\nday, her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her\\r\\nfolding stool under her arm, and would not consent to my carrying it,\\r\\nand she sat always by my side. She would remain there for hours,\\r\\nimmovable and mute, following with her eye the point of my brush, in its\\r\\nevery movement. When I would obtain, by a large splatch of color spread\\r\\non with a knife, a striking and unexpected effect, she would, in spite\\r\\nof herself, give vent to a half-suppressed \"Ah!\" of astonishment, of\\r\\njoy, of admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an\\r\\nalmost religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of\\r\\nnature\\'s work divine. My studies appeared to her as a kind of pictures\\r\\nof sanctity, and sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of\\r\\nconverting me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! He was a queer good-natured being, this God of hers. He was a sort\\r\\nof village philosopher without any great resources, and without great\\r\\npower; for she always figured him to herself as a being quivering over\\r\\ninjustices committed under his eyes, and as though he was helpless to\\r\\nprevent them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be the\\r\\nconfidant of his secrets and of his contrarieties. She said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God wills, or God does not will,\" just like a sergeant announcing to a\\r\\nrecruit: \"The colonel has commanded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of her heart, she deplored my ignorance of the intentions\\r\\nof the Eternal, which she strove, and felt herself compelled to impart\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every day, I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it from\\r\\nthe ground, in my box of colors, in my polished shoes, standing in the\\r\\nmornings in front of my door, those little pious brochures, which she,\\r\\nno doubt, received directly from Paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected cordiality.\\r\\nBut I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her manner; but,\\r\\nfor a while, I paid little attention to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I walked about, whether to the bottom of the valley, or through\\r\\nsome country lanes, I would see her suddenly appear, as though she were\\r\\nreturning from a rapid walk. She would then sit down abruptly, out of\\r\\nbreath, as though she had been running, or overcome by some profound\\r\\nemotion. Her face would be red, that English red which is denied to the\\r\\npeople of all other countries; then, without any reason, she would grow\\r\\npale, become the color of the ground and seem ready to faint away.\\r\\nGradually, however, I would see her regain her ordinary color, whereupon\\r\\nshe would begin to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a sentence,\\r\\nspring up from her seat, and march off so rapidly and so strangely, that\\r\\nit would, sometimes, put me to my wits ends to try and discover whether\\r\\nI had done or said anything to displease or offend her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finally came to the conclusion that this arose from her early habits\\r\\nand training, somewhat modified, no doubt, in honor of me, since the\\r\\nfirst days of our acquaintanceship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the\\r\\nwind-beaten coast, her long curled hair would be shaken out and hanging\\r\\nloose, as though it had broken away from its bearings. It was seldom\\r\\nthat this gave her any concern; looking sometimes as though she had just\\r\\nreturned from dining _sans cèremonie_; her locks having become\\r\\ndishevelled by the breezes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would then go up to her room in order to adjust what I called her\\r\\nglass lamps; and when I would say to her, in the familiar gallantry,\\r\\nwhich, however, always offended her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are as beautiful as a planet to-day, Miss Harriet,\" a little blood\\r\\nwould immediately mount into her cheeks, the blood of a young maiden,\\r\\nthe blood of sweet fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she would become abruptly savage and cease coming to watch me\\r\\npaint. I thought thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is only a fit of temper she is passing through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it did not always pass away. When I spoke to her sometimes, she\\r\\nwould answer me, either with an air of affected indifference, or in\\r\\nsullen anger; and became by turns rude, impatient, and nervous. For a\\r\\ntime I never saw her except at meals, and we spoke but little. I\\r\\nconcluded, at length, that I must have offended her in something: and,\\r\\naccordingly, I said to her one evening:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act towards me as formerly?\\r\\nWhat have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe responded, in an angry tone, in a manner altogether _sui generis_:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I be always with you the same as formerly.[4] It is not true, not\\r\\ntrue,\" and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt times she would look upon me with strange eyes. Since that time I\\r\\nhave often said to myself that those who are condemned to death must\\r\\nlook thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her\\r\\neye there lurked a species of folly, a folly at once mysterious and\\r\\nviolent; and even more; a fever, an exasperated desire, impatient, and\\r\\nat once incapable of being realized and unrealizable!\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, it seemed to me that there was also going on within her a combat,\\r\\nin which her heart struggled against an unknown force that she wished to\\r\\novercome, and even, perhaps, something else. But what could I know? What\\r\\ncould I know?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed a singular revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight appeared, on\\r\\na picture, the subject of which was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nA deep ravine, steep banks, dominated by two declivities, lined with\\r\\nbrambles and long rows of trees, hidden, drowned in that milky vapor,\\r\\nclad in that musty robe which sometimes floats over valleys, at break of\\r\\nday. And at the extreme end of that thick and transparent fog, you see\\r\\ncoming or, rather already come, a human couple, a stripling and a\\r\\nmaiden, embraced, inter-laced, she, with head leaning on him, he,\\r\\ninclined towards her, and lips to lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first ray of the sun glistening through the branches, has traversed\\r\\nthat fog of the dawn, has illuminated it with a rosy reflection, just\\r\\nbehind the rustic lovers, on which can be seen their vague shadows in a\\r\\nclear silver. It was well done, yes, indeed, well done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working on the declivity which led to the Val d\\'Etretat. This\\r\\nparticular morning, I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor, which\\r\\nwas necessary for my purpose. Suddenly, an object appeared in front of\\r\\nme, a kind of phantom; it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me, she took to\\r\\nflight. But I called after her saying: \"Come here, come here,\\r\\nMademoiselle, I have a nice little picture for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my\\r\\nsketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless,\\r\\nregarding it; and, suddenly, she burst into tears. She wept\\r\\nspasmodically, like men who have been struggling hard against shedding\\r\\ntears, but who can do so no longer, and abandon themselves to grief,\\r\\nthough still resisting. I got up, trembling, moved myself by the sight\\r\\nof a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her by the hand with an\\r\\nimpulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse which impels one\\r\\nquicker than one thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them quiver\\r\\nas if her whole nervous system was twisting and turning. Then she\\r\\nwithdrew her hands abruptly, or, rather tore them out of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized that shiver, as soon as I had felt it; I was deceived in\\r\\nnothing. Ah! the live shiver of a woman, whether she is fifteen or fifty\\r\\nyears of age, whether she is one of the people or one of the _monde_,\\r\\ngoes so straight to my heart that I never had any compunctions in\\r\\nunderstanding it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer whole frail being trembled, vibrated, swooned. I knew it. She walked\\r\\naway before I had time to say a word, leaving me as surprised as if I\\r\\nhad witnessed a miracle, and as troubled as if I had committed a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not go in to breakfast. I went to make a tour on the banks of the\\r\\nFalaise, feeling that I would just as lieve weep as laugh, looking on\\r\\nthe adventure as both comic and deplorable, and my position as\\r\\nridiculous, fain to believe that I had lost my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked myself what I ought to do. I debated with myself whether I ought\\r\\nto take my leave of the place and almost immediately my resolution was\\r\\nformed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time, and I\\r\\nentered the farm house just when the soup had been served up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down at the table, as usual. Miss Harriet was there, munching away\\r\\nsolemnly, without speaking to anyone, without even lifting eyes. She\\r\\nwore, however, her usual expression, both of countenance and manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited, patiently, till the meal had been finished, when, turning\\r\\ntowards the landlady I said: \"See here, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be\\r\\nlong now before I shall have to take my leave of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in a quivering\\r\\nvoice: \"My dear sir, what is it I have just heard you say? you are going\\r\\nto leave us, after I have become so much accustomed to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI regarded Miss Harriet from the corner of my eye. Her countenance did\\r\\nnot change in the least; but the under-servant came towards me with eyes\\r\\nwide open. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,\\r\\nfresh, as strong as a horse, yet possessing the rare attribute in one in\\r\\nher position--she was very neat and clean. I had embraced her at odd\\r\\ntimes, in out of the way corners, in the manner of a mountain guide,\\r\\nnothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the apple\\r\\ntrees, walking up and down at my ease, from one end of the court to the\\r\\nother. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange\\r\\ndiscovery of the morning, that grotesque love and passionate attachment\\r\\nfor me, the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,\\r\\nrecollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps, also, that look\\r\\nwhich the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my\\r\\ndeparture--all these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a\\r\\njolly humor of body, recalling the tickling sensation of kisses on the\\r\\nlips, and in the veins, something which urged me on to commit some\\r\\nfolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight having come on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, I\\r\\ndescried Céleste, who had gone to shut the hen coops, at the other end\\r\\nof the enclosure. I darted towards her, running so noiselessly that she\\r\\nheard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small traps by which\\r\\nthe chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained on her\\r\\ncoarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She made a struggle, laughing all\\r\\nthe same, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Wherefore\\r\\ndid I suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a\\r\\nshock? What was it that I heard behind me?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Miss Harriet who had come upon us, who had seen us, and who stood\\r\\nin front of us, as motionless as a specter. Then she disappeared in the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been surprised by\\r\\nher than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly that night; I was completely enervated and haunted by sad\\r\\nthoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping; but in this I was no doubt\\r\\ndeceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one\\r\\nwalking up and down in the house, and who had opened my door from the\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards morning, I was overcome by fatigue and sleep seized on me. I got\\r\\nup late and did not go downstairs until breakfast time, being still in a\\r\\nbewildered state, not knowing what kind of face to put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she did\\r\\nnot appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English\\r\\nwoman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was\\r\\nwont to do, in order to see the sun rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody seemed astonished at this and we began to eat in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was hot, very hot, one of those still, boiling days, when\\r\\nnot a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an apple\\r\\ntree; and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a jug\\r\\nof cider, everybody was so thirsty. Céleste brought the dishes from the\\r\\nkitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.\\r\\nAfterwards she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the\\r\\nseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wanted to wash and refresh these, I begged the servant to go and\\r\\nbring a pitcher of cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was dry. She\\r\\nhad lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord, and had touched\\r\\nthe bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again, it was empty. Mother\\r\\nLecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and looked\\r\\ndown the hole. She returned announcing that one could see clearly\\r\\nsomething in the well, something altogether unusual. But this, no doubt,\\r\\nwas pottles of straw, which, out of spite, had been cast down it by a\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wished also to look down the well, hoping I would be able to clear up\\r\\nthe mystery, and perched myself close to its brink. I perceived,\\r\\nindistinctly, a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the\\r\\nidea of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so, the\\r\\nyellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer.\\r\\nAll the four of us were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Céleste\\r\\nhaving now joined us. The lantern rested on a black and white,\\r\\nindistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have escaped from the meadow,\\r\\nduring the night, and fallen in headlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, suddenly, a cold shiver attacked my spine, I first recognized a\\r\\nfoot, then a clothed limb; the body was entire, but the other limb had\\r\\ndisappeared under the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned and trembled so violently that the light of the lamp danced\\r\\nhither and thither over the object, discovering a slipper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a woman! who ... who ... can it be? It is Miss Harriet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur alone did not manifest horror. He had witnessed many such scenes\\r\\nin Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste began to scream and to shriek, and ran\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead. I attached the\\r\\nvalet securely by the loins to the end of the pulley-rope, and I lowered\\r\\nhim slowly, and watched him disappear in the darkness. In the one hand\\r\\nhe had a lantern, and held on by the rope with the other. Soon I\\r\\nrecognized his voice, which seemed to come from the center of the earth,\\r\\ncrying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other limb.\\r\\nHe then bound the two feet together, and shouted anew:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haul up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI commenced to wind him up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,\\r\\nand I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When\\r\\nhis head appeared at the brink, I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\" as though I only expected that he would inform me of\\r\\nwhat he had discovered at the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both got on to the stone slab at the edge of the well, and, face to\\r\\nface, we hoisted the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Lecacheur and Céleste watched us from a distance, concealed from\\r\\nview behind the wall of the house. When they saw, issuing from the hole,\\r\\nthe black slippers and the white stockings of the drowned person, they\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSapeur seized the ankles of the poor chaste woman, and we drew it up,\\r\\nsloping, as it was, in the most immodest posture. The head was shocking\\r\\nto look at, being bruised and black; and the long, gray hair, hanging\\r\\ndown tangled and disordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of all that is holy, how lean she is!\" exclaimed Sapeur, in\\r\\na contemptuous tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an\\r\\nappearance, I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse\\r\\nfor burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nI washed her disfigured face. To the touch of my hand, an eye was\\r\\nslightly opened, which regarded me with that pale regard, with that cold\\r\\nlook, with that terrible look that corpses have, which seemed to come\\r\\nfrom beyond life. I plaited up, as well as I could, her disheveled hair,\\r\\nand I adjusted on her forehead, a novel and singularly formed lock. Then\\r\\nI took off her dripping wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of\\r\\nshame, as though I had been guilty of some profanation, her shoulders\\r\\nand her chest, and her long arms, as slim as the twigs of branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI next went to fetch some flowers, corn poppies, blue beetles,\\r\\nmarguerites, and fresh and perfumed herbs, with which to strew her\\r\\nfuneral couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI being the only person near her, it was necessary for me to perform the\\r\\nusual ceremonies. In a letter found in her pocket, written at the last\\r\\nmoment, it was ordered that her body was to be buried in the village in\\r\\nwhich she had passed the last days of her life. A frightful thought then\\r\\npressed on my heart. Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid\\r\\nto rest in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the evening, all the female gossips of the locality came to view\\r\\nthe remains of the defunct; but I would not allow a single person to\\r\\nenter; I wanted to be alone; and I watched by the corpse the whole\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the corpse by the flickering lights of the candles, this\\r\\nmiserable woman, wholly unknown, who had died lamentably and so far away\\r\\nfrom home. Had she left no friends, no relations behind her? What had\\r\\nher infancy been? What had been her life? Whence had she hailed thither\\r\\nthus, all alone, wanderer, lost like a dog driven from its home? What\\r\\nsecrets of sufferings and despair were sealed up in that disagreeable\\r\\nbody, in that spent, tarnished body--tarnished during the whole of its\\r\\nexistence, that impenetrable envelope which had driven her far away from\\r\\nall affection, from all love?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon that\\r\\nhuman creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all\\r\\nover with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which\\r\\nsustains the greatest outcasts--to wit, the hope of being loved for\\r\\nonce! Otherwise, why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from\\r\\nthe face of the others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so\\r\\npassionately, everything living that was not a man?\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized, also, that she believed in a God, and that she hoped to\\r\\nreceive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had\\r\\nendured. She had begun now to decompose, and to become, in turn, a\\r\\nplant. She who had blossomed in the sun, was now to be eaten up by the\\r\\ncattle, carried away in seeds, and flesh of beasts, would become again\\r\\nhuman flesh. But that which is called the soul, had been extinguished at\\r\\nthe bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She had changed\\r\\nher life for that of others yet to be born.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the dead. A\\r\\npale light at length announced the dawn of a new day, when a bright ray\\r\\nglistened on the bed, shed a dash of fire on the bed clothes and on her\\r\\nhands. This was the hour she had so much loved, when the awakened birds\\r\\nbegan to sing in the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened the window to its fullest extent, I drew back the curtains, so\\r\\nthat the whole heavens might look in upon us, and bending towards the\\r\\nglassy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head; then, slowly,\\r\\nwithout terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those\\r\\nlips, which had never before received any.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLéon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat\\r\\nthe Count d\\'Etraille, who blows his nose, from time to time. The\\r\\ncoachman alone had gone to sleep. The horses, which felt no longer the\\r\\nsting of the whip, had slowed their pace and dragged along softly, and\\r\\nthe brake, hardly advancing at all, became suddenly torpid, as if it had\\r\\nbeen charged with sorrow.',\n"," 'FRANCESCA AND CARLOTTA RONDOLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nNo (said my friend Charles Jouvent), I do not know Italy; I started to\\r\\nsee it thoroughly twice, and each time I was stopped at the frontier and\\r\\ncould not manage to get any further. And yet my two attempts gave me a\\r\\ncharming idea of the manners of that beautiful country. I must, however,\\r\\nsome time or other visit its cities, as well as the museums and works of\\r\\nart with which it abounds. I will also make another attempt to penetrate\\r\\ninto the interior, which I have not yet succeeded in doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\\'t understand me, so I will explain myself: In the spring of 1874\\r\\nI was seized with an irresistible desire to see Venice, Florence, Rome,\\r\\nand Naples. I am, as you know, not a great traveler; it appears to me a\\r\\nuseless and fatiguing business. Nights spent in a train, the disturbed\\r\\nslumbers of the railway carriage, with the attendant headache, and\\r\\nstiffness in every limb, the sudden waking in that rolling box, the\\r\\nunwashed feeling with your eyes and hair full of dust, the smell of the\\r\\ncoal on which one\\'s lungs feed, those bad dinners in the draughty\\r\\nrefreshment rooms are, according to my ideas, a horrible way of\\r\\nbeginning a pleasure trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this introduction by the express, we have the miseries of the\\r\\nhotel; of some great hotel full of people, and yet so empty; the strange\\r\\nroom, and the dubious bed! I am most particular about my bed; it is the\\r\\nsanctuary of life. We intrust our almost naked and fatigued bodies to it\\r\\nso that they may be reanimated by reposing between soft sheets and\\r\\nfeathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere we find the most delightful hours of our existence, the hours of\\r\\nlove and of sleep. The bed is sacred, and should be respected,\\r\\nvenerated, and loved by us as the best and most delightful of our\\r\\nearthly possessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot lift up the sheets of an hotel bed without a shiver of disgust.\\r\\nWhat have its occupants been doing in it the night before? Perhaps\\r\\ndirty, revolting people have slept in it. I begin, then, to think of all\\r\\nthe horrible people with whom one rubs shoulders every day, people with\\r\\nsuspicious-looking skin which makes one think of the feet and all the\\r\\nrest! I call to mind those who carry about with them the sickening smell\\r\\nof garlic or of humanity. I think of those who are deformed and\\r\\npurulent, of the perspiration emanating from the sick, and of everything\\r\\nthat is ugly and filthy in man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all this, perhaps, in the bed in which I am going to sleep! The mere\\r\\nidea of it makes me feel ill as I get in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the hotel dinners--those dreary _table d\\'hôte_ dinners in the\\r\\nmidst of all sorts of extraordinary people, or else those terrible\\r\\nsolitary dinners at a small table in a restaurant, feebly lighted up by\\r\\na wretched composite candle under a shade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, those terribly dull evenings in some unknown town! Do you know\\r\\nanything more wretched than when it is getting dark on such an occasion?\\r\\nOne goes about as if almost in a dream, looking at faces which one has\\r\\nnever seen before and will never see again; listening to people talking\\r\\nabout matters which are quite indifferent to you in a language that\\r\\nperhaps you do not understand. You have a terrible feeling, almost as if\\r\\nyou were lost, and you continue to walk on so as not to be obliged to\\r\\nreturn to the hotel, where you would feel more lost still because you\\r\\nare _at home_, in a home which belongs to anyone who can pay for it, and\\r\\nat last you fall into a chair of some well-lit café, whose gilding and\\r\\nlights overwhelm you a thousand times more than the shadows in the\\r\\nstreets. Then you feel so abominably lonely sitting in front of the\\r\\nglass of flat _bock_,[5] that a kind of madness seizes you, the longing\\r\\nto go somewhere or other, no matter where, as long as you need not\\r\\nremain in front of that marble table and in the dazzling brightness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, suddenly, you perceive that you are really alone in the world,\\r\\nalways and everywhere; but that in places which we know the familiar\\r\\njostlings give us the illusion only of human fraternity. At such moments\\r\\nof self-abandonment and somber isolation in distant cities one thinks\\r\\nbroadly, clearly, and profoundly. Then one suddenly sees the whole of\\r\\nlife outside the vision of eternal hope, outside the deceptions of our\\r\\ninnate habits, and of our expectations of happiness, of which we indulge\\r\\nin dreams never to be realized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only by going a long distance that we can fully understand how\\r\\nshort-lived and empty everything near at hand is; by searching for the\\r\\nunknown we perceive how commonplace and evanescent everything is; only\\r\\nby wandering over the face of the earth can we understand how small the\\r\\nworld is, and how very much alike everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow well I know, and how I hate and almost fear those haphazard walks\\r\\nthrough unknown streets; and this was the reason why, as nothing would\\r\\ninduce me to undertake a tour in Italy by myself, I made up my mind to\\r\\naccompany my friend Paul Pavilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know Paul, and how woman is everything, the world, life itself, to\\r\\nhim. There are many men like that, to whom existence becomes poetical\\r\\nand idealized by the presence of women. The earth is inhabitable only\\r\\nbecause they are there; the sun shines and is warm because it lights\\r\\nupon them; the air is soft and balmy because it blows upon their skin\\r\\nand ruffles the short hairs on their temples, and the moon is charming\\r\\nbecause it makes them dream and imparts a languorous charm to love.\\r\\nEvery act and action of Paul\\'s has woman for its motive; all his\\r\\nthoughts, all his efforts and hopes are centered on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I mentioned Italy to Paul he at first absolutely refused to leave\\r\\nParis. I, however, began to tell him of the adventures I had on my\\r\\ntravels. I assured him that all Italian women are charming, and I made\\r\\nhim hope for the most refined pleasures at Naples, thanks to certain\\r\\nletters of introduction which I had; and so at last he allowed himself\\r\\nto be persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the express one Thursday evening, Paul and I. Hardly anyone goes\\r\\nSouth at that time of the year, so that we had the carriage to\\r\\nourselves, and both of us were in a bad temper on leaving Paris, sorry\\r\\nfor having yielded to the temptation of this journey, and regretting\\r\\nMarly, the Seine, and our lazy boating excursions, and all those\\r\\npleasures in and near Paris which are so dear to every true Parisian.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the train started Paul stuck himself into his corner, and\\r\\nsaid, \"It is most idiotic to go all that way,\" and as it was too late\\r\\nfor him to change his mind then, I said, \"Well, you should not have\\r\\ncome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me no answer, and I felt very much inclined to laugh when I saw\\r\\nhow furious he looked. He is certainly always rather like a squirrel,\\r\\nbut then every one of us has retained the type of some animal or other\\r\\nas the mark of his primitive race. How many people have jaws like a\\r\\nbull-dog, or heads like goats, rabbits, foxes, horses, or oxen. Paul is\\r\\na squirrel turned into a man. He has its bright, quick eyes, its old\\r\\nhair, pointed nose, its small, fine, supple, active body, and a certain\\r\\nmysterious resemblance in his general bearing: in fact, a similarity of\\r\\nmovements, of gestures, and of bearing which might almost be taken for a\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we both went to sleep with that uncomfortable slumber of the\\r\\nrailway carriage, which is interrupted by horrible cramps in the arms\\r\\nand neck, and by the sudden stoppages of the train.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe woke up as we were going along the Rhone. Soon the continued noise of\\r\\nthe grasshoppers came in through the window, that cry which seems to be\\r\\nthe voice of the warm earth, the song of Provence; and seemed to instill\\r\\ninto our looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling\\r\\nof the South, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light\\r\\nsoil of the olive, with its gray-green foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train stopped again a railway servant ran along the train\\r\\ncalling out \"Valence\" in a sonorous voice, with an accent that again\\r\\ngave us a taste of that Provence which the shrill note of the\\r\\ngrasshoppers had already imparted to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing new happened until we got to Marseilles, where we got out to\\r\\nbreakfast, but when we returned to our carriage we found a woman\\r\\ninstalled there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, with a delightful look at me, gave his short moustache a\\r\\nmechanical twirl, and passed his fingers through his hair, which had\\r\\nbecome slightly out of order with the night\\'s journey. Then he sat down\\r\\nopposite the newcomer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I happen to see a striking new face, either while traveling or\\r\\nin society, I always have the strongest inclination to find out what\\r\\ncharacter, mind, and intellectual capacities are hidden beneath those\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a young and pretty woman, a native of the South of France\\r\\ncertainly, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so\\r\\nthick, long, and strong that it seemed almost too heavy for her head.\\r\\nShe was dressed with a certain Southern elegant bad taste which made her\\r\\nlook a little vulgar. Her regular features had none of the grace and\\r\\nfinish of the refined races, of that slight delicacy which members of\\r\\nthe aristocracy inherit from their birth, and which is the hereditary\\r\\nmark of thinner blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer bracelets were too big to be of gold; she wore earrings with large\\r\\nwhite stones which were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged\\r\\nunmistakably to the commonalty. One would have guessed that she would\\r\\ntalk too loud, and shout on every occasion with exaggerated gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the train started she remained motionless in her place, in the\\r\\nattitude of a woman who was in a rage, without even looking at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul began to talk to me, evidently with an eye to effect, trying to\\r\\nattract her attention, like shopkeepers who expose their choice wares to\\r\\ncatch the notice of passers-by.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe, however, did not appear to be paying the least attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toulon! Ten minutes to wait! Refreshment room!\" the porters shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul motioned to me to get out, and as soon as we had done so, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder who on earth she can be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to laugh. \"I am sure I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t the least care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was quite excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is an uncommonly fresh and pretty girl. What eyes she has, and how\\r\\ncross she looks. She must have been dreadfully worried, for she takes no\\r\\nnotice of anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have all your trouble for nothing,\" I growled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to lose his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not taking any trouble, my dear fellow. I think her an extremely\\r\\npretty woman, that is all. If one could only speak to her! But I don\\'t\\r\\nknow how to begin. Cannot you give me an idea? Can\\'t you guess who she\\r\\nis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot. However, I should rather think she is some\\r\\nstrolling actress who is going to rejoin her company after a love\\r\\nadventure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed quite upset, as if I had said something insulting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What makes you think that? On the contrary, I think she looks most\\r\\nrespectable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look at her bracelets,\" I said, \"her earrings and her whole dress.\\r\\nI should not be the least surprised if she were a dancer or a circus\\r\\nrider, but most likely a dancer. Her whole style smacks very much of the\\r\\ntheater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe evidently did not like the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is much too young, I am sure; why, she is hardly twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"there are many things which one can do before one is\\r\\ntwenty; dancing and reciting are among them, without counting another\\r\\nlittle business which is, perhaps, her sole occupation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take your seats for Nice, Vintimiglia,\" the guards and porters called\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got in; our fellow passenger was eating an orange, and certainly she\\r\\ndid not do it elegantly. She had spread her pocket-handkerchief on her\\r\\nknees, and the way in which she tore off the peel and opened her mouth\\r\\nto put in the figs, and then spat the pips out of the window, showed\\r\\nthat her education had been decidedly vulgar.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed, also, more put out than ever, and swallowed the fruit with\\r\\nan exceedingly comic air of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul devoured her with his eyes, and tried to attract her attention and\\r\\nexcite her curiosity, but in spite of his talk and of the manner in\\r\\nwhich he brought in well-known names, she did not pay the least\\r\\nattention to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passing Fréjus and St. Raphael, the train passed through a\\r\\nveritable garden, a paradise of roses, and groves of oranges and lemons\\r\\ncovered with fruit and flowers at the same time. That delightful coast\\r\\nfrom Marseilles to Genoa is a kingdom of perfumes in a home of flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune is the time to see it in all its beauty, when in every narrow\\r\\nvalley and on every slope, the most exquisite flowers are growing\\r\\nluxuriantly. And the roses! fields, hedges, groves of roses. They climb\\r\\nup the walls, blossom on the roofs, hang from the trees, peep out from\\r\\namong the bushes; they are white, red, yellow, large and small, single,\\r\\nwith a simple self-colored dress, or full and heavy in brilliant\\r\\ntoilets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir continual breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, while the still\\r\\nmore penetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere\\r\\ntill it might almost be called the sugar-plum of the smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless\\r\\nMediterranean. The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the\\r\\nmountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the hard, fixed blue\\r\\nsea. The train went on, through the tunnels, along the slopes, above the\\r\\nwater, on straight, wall-like viaducts, and a soft, vague, saltish\\r\\nsmell, a smell of drying seaweed, mingled at times with the strong,\\r\\nheavy perfume of the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul neither saw, looked at, nor smelled anything, for our fellow\\r\\ntraveler engrossed all his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got to Cannes, as he wished to speak to me he signed to me to\\r\\nget out again, and as soon as I had done so he took me by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, she is really charming. Just look at her eyes; and I never\\r\\nsaw anything like her hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t excite yourself,\" I replied, \"or else tackle her, if you have any\\r\\nintentions that way. She does not look impregnable, I fancy, although\\r\\nshe appears to be a little bit grumpy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you speak to her?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say, for I am always terribly stupid at first; I\\r\\ncan never make advances to a woman in the street. I follow them, go\\r\\nround and round them, and quite closely to them, but I never know what\\r\\nto say at first. I only once tried to enter into conversation with a\\r\\nwoman in that way. As I clearly saw that she was waiting for me to make\\r\\novertures, and as I felt bound to say something, I stammered out, \\'I\\r\\nhope you are quite well, madam?\\' She laughed in my face, and I made my\\r\\nescape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised Paul to do all I could to bring about a conversation, and\\r\\nwhen we had taken our places again, I politely asked our neighbor:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any objection to the smell of tobacco, madam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe merely replied, \"_Non capisco_.\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she was Italian! I felt an absurd inclination to laugh. As Paul did\\r\\nnot understand a word of that language, I was obliged to act as his\\r\\ninterpreter, so I said in Italian:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked you, madam, whether you had any objection to tobacco smoke?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an angry look she replied, \"_Che mi fa_.\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had neither turned her head nor looked at me, and I really did not\\r\\nknow whether to take this \"What does it matter to me\" for an\\r\\nauthorization, a refusal, a real sign of indifference, or for a mere\\r\\n\"Leave me alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame,\" I replied, \"if you mind the smell of tobacco in the least--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe again said, \"_Mica_,\"[8] in a tone of voice which seemed to mean, \"I\\r\\nwish to goodness you would leave me alone!\" It was, however, a kind of\\r\\npermission, so I said to Paul:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can smoke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me in that curious sort of way that people have when they\\r\\ntry to understand others who are talking in a strange language before\\r\\nthem, and asked me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked if we might smoke, and she said we might do whatever we liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon I lighted my cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did she not say anything more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had counted her words you would have noticed that she used\\r\\nexactly six, two of which gave me to understand that she knew no French,\\r\\nso four remained, and a lot can be said in four words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul seemed quite unhappy, disappointed, and \"at sea,\" so to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly the Italian asked me, in that tone of discontent which\\r\\nseemed habitual to her, \"Do you know at what time we shall get to\\r\\nGenoa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock,\" I replied. Then after a moment I went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friend and I are also going to Genoa, and if we can be of any\\r\\nservice to you, we shall be very happy, as you are quite alone.\" But she\\r\\ninterrupted with such a \"_Mica_\" that I did not venture on another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She said that she thought you were charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was in no humor for joking, and begged me, dryly, not to make\\r\\nfun of him, so I translated her question and my polite offer, which had\\r\\nbeen so rudely rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he really became as agitated as a squirrel in a cage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we only knew,\" he said, \"what hotel she was going to, we would go to\\r\\nthe same. Try and find out, so as to have another opportunity for making\\r\\nher speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not particularly easy, and I did not know what pretext to invent,\\r\\nanxious as I was to make the acquaintance of this unapproachable person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed Nice, Monaco, Mentone, and the train stopped at the frontier\\r\\nfor the examination of luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I hate those badly brought-up people who breakfast and dine in\\r\\nrailway-carriages, I went and bought a quantity of good things to make\\r\\none last attack on her by their means. I felt sure that this girl must,\\r\\nordinarily, be by no means inaccessible. Something had put her out and\\r\\nmade her irritable, but very little would suffice, a mere word or some\\r\\nagreeable offer, to decide her and overcome her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started again, and we three were still alone. I spread my eatables\\r\\nout on the seat. I cut up the fowl, put the slices of ham neatly on a\\r\\npiece of paper, and then carefully laid out our dessert, the\\r\\nstrawberries, plums, cherries, and cakes, close to the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she saw that we were going to eat she took a piece of chocolate and\\r\\ntwo little crisp cakes out of her pocket and began to munch them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask her to have some of ours,\" Paul said in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I want to do, but it is rather a difficult\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she, however, glanced from time to time at our provisions, I felt\\r\\nsure that she would still be hungry when she had finished what she had,\\r\\nso as soon as her frugal meal was over, I said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be very kind of you if you would take some of this fruit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she said \"_Mica_,\" but less crossly than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"may I offer you a little wine? I see you have not\\r\\ndrunk anything. It is Italian wine, and as we are now in your own\\r\\ncountry, we should be very pleased to see such a pretty Italian mouth\\r\\naccept the offer of its French neighbors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head slightly, evidently wishing to refuse, but very\\r\\ndesirous of accepting, and her mica _this_ time was almost polite. I\\r\\ntook the bottle, which was covered with straw in the Italian fashion,\\r\\nand filling the glass I offered it to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please drink it,\" I said, \"to bid us welcome to your country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the glass with her usual look, and emptied it at a draught,\\r\\nlike a woman tormented with thirst, and then gave it back to me without\\r\\neven saying \"Thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I offered her the cherries. \"Please take some,\" I said; \"we shall\\r\\nbe so pleased if you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of her corner she looked at all the fruit spread out before her, and\\r\\nsaid so rapidly that I could scarcely follow her: \"_A me non piacciono\\r\\nne le ciliegie ne le susine; amo soltano le fragole_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does she say?\" Paul asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she does not care for cherries or plums, but only for\\r\\nstrawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a newspaper full of wild strawberries on her lap, and she ate them\\r\\nquickly, throwing them into her mouth from some distance in a coquettish\\r\\nand charming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had finished the little red heap which we had seen rapidly\\r\\ndiminishing, crushed and disappearing under the rapid action of her\\r\\nhands, I asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What may I offer you now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take a little chicken,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe certainly devoured half of it, tearing it to pieces with the rapid\\r\\nmovements of her jaws like some carnivorous animal. Then she made up her\\r\\nmind to have some cherries, which she \"did not like,\" then some plums,\\r\\nthen some little cakes. Then she said, \"I have had enough,\" and sat back\\r\\nin her corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was much amused, and tried to make her eat more, pressing her, in\\r\\nfact, till she suddenly got in a rage again, and flung such a furious\\r\\n_mica_ at me, that I would no longer run the risk of spoiling her\\r\\ndigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to my friend. \"My poor Paul,\" I said, \"I am afraid we have had\\r\\nour trouble for nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night came on, one of those hot summer nights which extend their\\r\\nwarm shade over the burning and exhausted earth. Here and there, in the\\r\\ndistance by the sea on capes and promontories, bright stars began to\\r\\nshine on the dark horizon, which I was, at times, almost inclined to\\r\\nconfound with lighthouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scent of the orange-trees became more penetrating, and we breathed\\r\\nwith delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply. The balmy\\r\\nair was soft, delicious, almost divine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed something like a shower of stars under the dense\\r\\nshade of the trees along the line, where it was quite dark. It might\\r\\nhave been taken for drops of light, leaping, flying, playing and running\\r\\namong the leaves, or for small stars fallen from the skies in order to\\r\\nhave an excursion on the earth; but they were only fireflies dancing a\\r\\nstrange fiery ballet in the perfumed air.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them happened to come into our carriage, and shed its\\r\\nintermittent light, which seemed to be extinguished one moment and to be\\r\\nburning the next. I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade, and\\r\\nwatched the strange fly careering about in its fiery flight. Suddenly it\\r\\nsettled on the dark hair of our neighbor, who was half dozing after\\r\\ndinner. Paul seemed delighted, with his eyes fixed on the bright,\\r\\nsparkling spot which looked like a living jewel on the forehead of the\\r\\nsleeping woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian woke up at about eleven o\\'clock, with the bright insect\\r\\nstill in her hair. When I saw her move, I said: \"We are just getting to\\r\\nGenoa, madam,\" and she murmured, without answering me, as if possessed\\r\\nby some obstinate and embarrassing thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What am I going to do, I wonder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she suddenly asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so taken aback that I really did not understand her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? How do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe repeated, looking more and more furious:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you like me to go with you now, as soon as we get out of the\\r\\ntrain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite willing; but where do you want to go to? Where shall I take\\r\\nyou to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrugged her shoulders with an air of supreme indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wherever you like; what does it matter to me?\" She repeated her _Che mi\\r\\nfa_? twice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we are going to the hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, let us all go to the hotel,\" she said, in a contemptuous\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She wants to know if we should like her to come with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend\\'s utter surprise restored my self-possession. He stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With us? Where to? What for? How?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but she made this strange proposal to me in a most\\r\\nirritable voice. I told her that we were going to the hotel, and she\\r\\nsaid: \\'Very well, let us all go there!\\' I suppose she is without a\\r\\nhalfpenny. She certainly has a very strange way of making\\r\\nacquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, who was very much excited, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite agreeable. Tell her that we will take her wherever she\\r\\nlikes.\" Then, after a moment\\'s hesitation, he said uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must know, however, with whom she wants to go--with you or with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to the Italian, who did not even seem to be listening to us,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be very happy to take you with us, but my friend wants to know\\r\\nwhether you will take my arm or his?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened her black eyes wide with vague surprise, and said, \"_Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was obliged to explain myself. \"In Italy, I believe, when a man looks\\r\\nafter a woman, fulfills all her wishes, and satisfies all her caprices,\\r\\nhe is called a _patito_. Which of us two will you take for your\\r\\n_patito_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the slightest hesitation she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to Paul. \"You see, my friend, she chooses me; you have no\\r\\nchance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the better for you,\" he replied, in a rage. Then, after thinking\\r\\nfor a few moments, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really care about taking this creature with you? She will spoil\\r\\nour journey. What are we to do with this woman, who looks like I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what? They will not take us in at any decent hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, just began to find the Italian much nicer than I had thought\\r\\nher at first, and I was now very anxious to take her with us. The idea\\r\\ndelighted me. I already felt those little shivers which the expectation\\r\\nof a night of love sends through the veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied, \"My dear fellow, we have accepted and it is too late to\\r\\nrecede. You were the first to advise me to say \\'Yes.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very stupid,\" he growled, \"but do as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train whistled, slackened speed, and we ran into the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She\\r\\njumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of\\r\\nseeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we started off\\r\\ninto the town, Paul walking in utter silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To what hotel shall we go?\" I asked him. \"It may be difficult to get\\r\\ninto the _City of Paris_ with a woman, especially with this Italian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul interrupted me. \"Yes, with an Italian who looks more like a\\r\\nstrumpet than a duchess. However, that is no business of mine. Do just\\r\\nas you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in a state of perplexity. I had written to the _City of Paris_ to\\r\\nretain our rooms, and now I did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo commissionaires followed us with our luggage. I continued: \"You\\r\\nmight as well go on first, and say that we are coming; and give the\\r\\nlandlord to understand that I have a--a friend with me, so that we\\r\\nshould like rooms quite by themselves for us three, so as not to be\\r\\nbrought in contact with other travelers. He will understand, and we will\\r\\ndecide according to his answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Paul growled, \"Thank you; such sort of commissions and such parts do\\r\\nnot suit me by any means. I did not come here to get ready your\\r\\napartments or to minister to your pleasures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was urgent: \"Look here, don\\'t be angry. It is surely far better to\\r\\ngo to a good hotel than to a bad one, and it is not difficult to ask the\\r\\nlandlord for three separate bedrooms and a dining-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI put a stress on _three_, and that decided him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on first, and I saw him go into a large hotel while I remained\\r\\non the other side of the street dragging along my fair Italian, who did\\r\\nnot say a word, and followed by the porters with the luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul came back at last, looking as dissatisfied as my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is settled,\" he said, \"and they will take us in; but there are\\r\\nonly two bedrooms. You must settle it as you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed him, rather ashamed of going in with such a strange\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two bedrooms separated by a small sitting-room. I ordered a\\r\\ncold supper, and then I turned to the Italian with a perplexed look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have only been able to get two rooms, so you must choose which you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied with her eternal _Che mi fa_? I thereupon took her little\\r\\nblack wooden box, just like servants use, and took it into the room on\\r\\nthe right, which I had chosen for her, ... for us. A bit of paper was\\r\\nfastened on to the box, on which was written, _Mademoiselle Francesca\\r\\nRondoli, Genoa_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your name is Francesca?\" I asked, and she nodded her head, without\\r\\nreplying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall have supper directly,\" I continued. \"Meanwhile, I daresay you\\r\\nwould like to arrange your dress a little?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered with a _mica_, a word which she employed just as frequently\\r\\nas _Che mi fa_, but I went on: \"It is always pleasant after a journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I suddenly remembered that she had not, perhaps, the necessary\\r\\nobjects, for she appeared to me in a very singular position, as if she\\r\\nhad just escaped from some disagreeable adventure, and I brought her my\\r\\ndressing-case.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put out all the little instruments for cleanliness and comfort which\\r\\nit contained: a nailbrush, a new toothbrush--for I always carry a\\r\\nselection of them about with me--my nail-scissors, a nail-file, and\\r\\nsponges. I uncorked a bottle of eau de cologne, one of lavender-water,\\r\\nand a little bottle of new-mown hay, so that she might have a choice.\\r\\nThen I opened my powder-box, and put out the powder-puff, put my fine\\r\\ntowels over the water-jug, and placed a piece of new soap near the\\r\\nbasin.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe watched my movements with a vexed look in her wide open eyes,\\r\\nwithout appearing either astonished or satisfied at my forethought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is all that you require,\" I then said; \"I will tell you when\\r\\nsupper is ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned to the sitting-room I found that Paul had taken\\r\\npossession of the other room, and had shut himself in, so I sat down to\\r\\nwait.\\r\\n\\r\\nA waiter went backwards and forwards, bringing plates and glasses. He\\r\\nlaid the table slowly, then put a cold fowl on it, and told me that all\\r\\nwas ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knocked gently at Mademoiselle Rondoli\\'s door. \"Come in,\" she said,\\r\\nand when I did so I was struck by a strong, heavy smell of perfumes, as\\r\\nif I were in a hairdresser\\'s and perfumer\\'s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian was sitting on her box in an attitude either of thoughtful\\r\\ndiscontent or absent-mindedness. The towel was still folded over the\\r\\nwater-jug that was quite full, and the soap, untouched and dry, was\\r\\nlaying beside the empty basin; but one would have thought that the young\\r\\nwoman had drunk half of the bottles of scent. The eau de cologne,\\r\\nhowever, had been spared, as only about a third of it had gone; but to\\r\\nmake up for that she had used a surprising amount of lavender-water and\\r\\nnew-mown hay. A cloud of violet-powder, a vague white mist, seemed still\\r\\nto be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-powdering her\\r\\nface and neck. It seemed to cover her eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hair\\r\\non her temples like snow, while her cheeks were plastered with it, and\\r\\nlayers of it covered her nostrils, the corners of her eyes, and her\\r\\nchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she got up she exhaled such a strong odor of scent that it almost\\r\\nmade me feel faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she sat down to supper, I found that Paul was in a most execrable\\r\\ntemper, and I could get nothing out of him but blame, irritable words,\\r\\nand disagreeable compliments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMademoiselle Francesca ate like an ogre, and as soon as she had finished\\r\\nher meal she threw herself upon the sofa. As for me, I saw the decisive\\r\\nmoment approaching for settling how we were to apportion the rooms. I\\r\\ndetermined to take the bull by the horns, and sitting down by the\\r\\nItalian I said gallantly, kissing her hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As we have only two bedrooms, will you allow me to share yours with\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do just as you like,\" she said. \"It is all the same to me. _Che mi\\r\\nfa_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer indifference vexed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are sure you do not mind my being in your room with you?\" I\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all the same to me; do just as you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you like to go to bed at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I am very sleepy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up, yawned, gave Paul her hand, who took it with a furious look,\\r\\nand I lighted her into our room. A disquieting feeling haunted me. \"Here\\r\\nis all you want,\" I said again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I took care to pour half the water into the basin, and to put\\r\\na towel near the soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went back to Paul. As soon as I got into the room, he said, \"You\\r\\nhave got a nice sort of camel there!\" and I answered, laughing. \"My\\r\\ndear friend, don\\'t speak ill of sour grapes,\" and he replied,\\r\\nill-temperedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just take care how this ends, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost trembled with that feeling of fear which assails us after some\\r\\nsuspicious love escapade--that fear which spoils our pleasant meetings,\\r\\nour unexpected caresses, our chance kisses. However, I put a bold face\\r\\non the matter. \"At any rate, the girl is no adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fellow had me in his power; he had seen the shadow of my anxiety\\r\\non my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about her? You really astonish me. You pick up an\\r\\nItalian woman traveling alone by railway, and she volunteers, with most\\r\\nsingular cynicism, to go and to be your mistress in the first hotel you\\r\\ncome to. You take her with you, and then you declare that she is not\\r\\na----! And you persuade yourself that you are not running more risk than\\r\\nif you were to go and spend the night with a woman who had the\\r\\nsmall-pox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed with an unpleasant and angry laugh. I sat down, a prey to\\r\\nuneasiness. What was I to do, for he was right after all? And a struggle\\r\\nbegan within me, between desire and fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"Do as you like, I have warned you, so, do not complain of\\r\\nthe consequences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I saw an ironical gayety in his eyes, such a delight in his revenge,\\r\\nand he made fun of me so jovially that I did not hesitate any longer. I\\r\\ngave him my hand, and said, \"Good night. You know the old saying: _A\\r\\nvictory without peril is a triumph without glory_, and upon my word, the\\r\\nvictory is worth the danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with a firm step I went into Francesca\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped short at the door in surprise and astonishment. She was\\r\\nalready asleep. Sleep had overcome her when she had finished undressing,\\r\\nand she was reposing in the charming attitude of one of Titian\\'s women.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed as if she had lain down from sheer fatigue in order to take\\r\\noff her stockings, for they were lying on the bed. Then she had thought\\r\\nof something pleasant, no doubt, for she had waited to finish her\\r\\nreverie before moving, and then, closing her eyes, she had lost\\r\\nconsciousness. A nightgown, embroidered about the neck such as one buys\\r\\nin cheap ready-made shops, was lying on the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was charming, young, firm and fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing prettier than a pretty woman asleep, and in a moment,\\r\\nseeing her thus in all her naïve charms, I was going to forget my\\r\\nfriend\\'s prudent counsels, but, suddenly turning to the toilet-table, I\\r\\nsaw everything in the same state as I left it, and I sat down, anxious,\\r\\nand a prey to irresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained thus for a long time, not able to make up my mind either what\\r\\nto do. Retreat was impossible, and I must either pass the night on a\\r\\nchair, or go to bed myself at my own risk and peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no thoughts of sleeping either here or there, for my head was too\\r\\nexcited and my eyes too occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved about without stopping, feverish uncomfortable, enervated. Then\\r\\nI began to reason with myself, certainly with a view to capitulation.\\r\\n\"If I lie down that does not bind me to anything, and I shall certainly\\r\\nbe more comfortable on a mattress than on a chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI undressed slowly, and then, stepping over the sleeping girl, I\\r\\nstretched myself out against the wall, turning my back on temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this position I remained for a long time without going to sleep, when\\r\\nsuddenly my neighbor woke up. She opened her eyes with astonishment, and\\r\\nstill with that discontented look in them; then, perceiving that she was\\r\\nundressed, she got up, and calmly put on her nightgown with as much\\r\\nindifference as if I had not been present.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning, she did not trouble herself at all about me, and immediately\\r\\nwent quietly to sleep again with her head resting on her right arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, I began to meditate on human weakness and fatuity, and then I\\r\\nwent to sleep also.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up early, like a woman who is used to work in the morning. She\\r\\nwoke me up by doing so, and I watched her through my half-closed\\r\\neyelids.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came and went without hurrying herself, as if she were astonished at\\r\\nhaving nothing to do. At length she went to the toilet-table, and in a\\r\\nmoment she emptied all the scent that remained in my bottles. She\\r\\ncertainly also used some water, but very little.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was quite dressed, she sat down on her box again, and holding\\r\\none knee between her hands, she seemed to be thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment I first pretended to notice her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning, Francesca.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout seeming in at all a better temper than the previous night, she\\r\\nmurmured, \"Good morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I asked her whether she slept well, she nodded _Yes_, and jumping\\r\\nout of bed, I went and kissed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her face towards me like a child who is being kissed against\\r\\nits will; but I took her tenderly in my arms, and gently put my lips on\\r\\nher large eyes, which she closed with evident distaste under my kisses\\r\\non her fresh cheeks and full lips which she turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t seem to like being kissed,\" I said to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Mica_\" was her only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the trunk by her side, and, passing my arm through hers, I\\r\\nsaid: \"_Mica! mica! mica_! in reply to everything. I shall call you\\r\\nMademoiselle _Mica_, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time I fancied that I saw the shadow of a smile on her\\r\\nlips, but it passed by so quickly that I may have been mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you never say anything but _Mica_ I shall not know what to do to\\r\\ntry to please you. Let us see; what shall we do to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated a moment as if some fancy had flitted through her head,\\r\\nand then she said carelessly: \"It is all the same to me; whatever you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, Mademoiselle _Mica_, we will have a carriage and go for a\\r\\ndrive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you please,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was waiting for us in the dining-room, looking as bored as third\\r\\nparties generally do in love affairs. I assumed a delighted air, and\\r\\nshook hands with him with triumphant energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking of doing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all we will go and see a little of the town, and then we might\\r\\ntake a carriage, for a drive in the neighborhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe breakfasted nearly in silence and then started. I dragged Francesca\\r\\nfrom palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely just\\r\\nglanced carelessly at all the various masterpieces. Paul followed us,\\r\\ngrowling all sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a\\r\\nsilent drive into the country and returned to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day it was the same thing and the next day again; so on the\\r\\nthird Paul said to me: \"Look here, I am going to leave you; I am not\\r\\ngoing to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this\\r\\ncreature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was perplexed and annoyed, for to my great surprise I had become\\r\\nsingularly attached to Francesca. A man is but weak and foolish, carried\\r\\naway by the merest trifle, and a coward every time that his senses are\\r\\nexcited or mastered. I clung to this unknown girl, silent and\\r\\ndissatisfied as she always was. I liked her somewhat ill-tempered face,\\r\\nthe dissatisfied droop of her mouth, the weariness of her look; I liked\\r\\nher fatigued movements, the contemptuous way in which she yielded to my\\r\\ndesires, the very indifference of her caresses. A secret bond, that\\r\\nmysterious bond of animal love, the secret attachment of that possession\\r\\nwhich does not satiate, bound me to her. I told Paul so, quite frankly.\\r\\nHe treated me as if I had been a fool, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, take her with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she obstinately refused to leave Genoa, without giving any reason. I\\r\\nbesought, I reasoned, I promised, but all was of no avail, and so I\\r\\nstayed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul declared that he would go by himself, and went so far as to pack up\\r\\nhis portmanteau; but he remained all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus a fortnight passed. Francesca was always silent and irritable,\\r\\nlived beside me rather than with me, responded to all my desires, all my\\r\\ndemands, and all my propositions with her perpetual _Che mi fa_, or\\r\\nwith her no less perpetual _Mica_.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend got more and more furious, but my only answer was, \"You can go\\r\\nif you are tired of staying. I am not detaining you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called me names, overwhelmed me with reproaches, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\"Where do you think I can go to now? We had three weeks at our disposal,\\r\\nand here is a fortnight gone! I cannot continue my journey now; and, in\\r\\nany case, I am not going to Venice, Florence, and Rome all by myself.\\r\\nBut you will pay for it, and more dearly than you think for, most\\r\\nlikely. You are not going to bring a man all the way from Paris in order\\r\\nto shut him up at an hotel in Genoa with an Italian adventuress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I told him, very calmly, to return to Paris, he exclaimed that he\\r\\nwas going to do so the very next day; but the next day he was still\\r\\nthere, still in a rage and swearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time we began to be known in the streets through which we\\r\\nwandered from morning till night. Sometimes French people would turn\\r\\nround astonished at meeting their fellow-countrymen in the company of\\r\\nthis girl with her striking costume, and who looked singularly out of\\r\\nplace, not to say compromising, beside us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to walk along, leaning on my arm, without looking at anything.\\r\\nWhy did she remain with me, with us, who seemed to procure her so little\\r\\npleasure? Who was she? Where did she come from? What was she doing? Had\\r\\nshe any plan or idea? Where did she live? As an adventuress, or by\\r\\nchance meetings? I tried in vain to find out and to explain it. The\\r\\nbetter I knew her the more enigmatical she became. She was not one of\\r\\nthose who make a living by any profession of venal love. She rather\\r\\nseemed to me to be a girl of poor family who had been seduced and taken\\r\\naway, and then cast aside and lost. What did she think was going to\\r\\nbecome of her, or whom was she waiting for? She certainly did not appear\\r\\nto be trying to make a conquest of me, or to get any real profit out of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to question her, to speak to her of her childhood and family;\\r\\nbut she never gave me an answer. I stayed with her, my heart unfettered\\r\\nand my senses enchained, never wearied of holding her in my arms, that\\r\\nproud and quarrelsome woman, captivated by my senses, or rather seduced,\\r\\novercome by a youthful, healthy, powerful charm, which emanated from her\\r\\nsweet-smelling person and from the robust lines of her body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother week passed, and the term of my journey was drawing on, for I\\r\\nhad to be back in Paris by July 11. By this time Paul had come to take\\r\\nhis part in the adventure, though still grumbling at me, while I\\r\\ninvented pleasures, distractions, and excursions to amuse my mistress\\r\\nand my friend; and in order to do this I gave myself a large amount of\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day I proposed an excursion to Sta Margarita, that charming little\\r\\ntown in the midst of gardens, hidden at the foot of a slope which\\r\\nstretches far into the sea up to the village of Portofino. We all three\\r\\nwere following the excellent road which goes along the foot of the\\r\\nmountain. Suddenly Francesca said to me: \"I shall not be able to go with\\r\\nyou to-morrow; I must go and see some of my relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all; I did not ask her any questions, as I was quite sure she\\r\\nwould not answer me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she got up very early; then, as I remained in bed, she\\r\\nsat down at the foot of it, and said in a constrained and hesitating\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I do not come back to-night, shall you come and fetch me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly I shall,\" was my reply. \"Where must I come to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she explained: \"You must go into the Street Victor-Emmanuel, down\\r\\nthe Passage Falene, and go into the furniture shop at the bottom, in a\\r\\ncourt, and there you must ask for Mme. Rondoli--That is where it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she went away, leaving me rather astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Paul saw that I was alone he stammered out: \"Where is Francesca?\"\\r\\nAnd when I told him what had happened he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, let us make use of our chance, and bolt; as it is, our\\r\\ntime is up. Two days, more or less, make no difference. Let us start at\\r\\nonce; go and pack up your things. Off we go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused. I could not, as I told him, leave the girl in such a\\r\\nmanner, after having lived with her for nearly three weeks. At any rate,\\r\\nI ought to say good-bye to her, and make her accept a present; I\\r\\ncertainly had no intention of behaving badly to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he would not listen; he pressed and worried me, but I would not give\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained indoors for several hours, expecting Francesca\\'s return, but\\r\\nshe did not come, and at last, at dinner, Paul said with a triumphant\\r\\nair: \"She has thrown you over, my dear fellow; it is certainly very\\r\\nstrange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI must acknowledge that I was surprised and rather vexed. He laughed in\\r\\nmy face, and made fun of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not exactly a bad way of getting rid of you, though rather\\r\\nprimitive. \\'Just wait for me, I shall be back in a moment,\\' they often\\r\\nsay. How long are you going to wait? I should not wonder if you were\\r\\nfoolish enough to go and look for her at the address she gave you. \\'Does\\r\\nMme. Rondoli live here, please?\\' \\'No, Sir.\\' I\\'ll bet that you are\\r\\nlonging to go there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least,\" I protested, \"and I assure you that if she does not\\r\\ncome back to-morrow morning I shall start by the express at eight\\r\\no\\'clock. I shall have waited twenty-four hours, and that is enough; my\\r\\nconscience will be quite clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent an uneasy and unpleasant evening, for I really had at heart a\\r\\nvery tender feeling for her. I went to bed at twelve o\\'clock, and hardly\\r\\nslept at all. I got up at six, called Paul, packed up my things, and two\\r\\nhours later we started for France together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next year, at just about the same period, I was seized, as one is\\r\\nwith a periodical fever, with a new desire to go to Italy, and I\\r\\nimmediately made up my mind to carry it into effect. There is no doubt\\r\\nthat every well-educated man ought to see Florence, Venice, and Rome. It\\r\\nhas, also, the additional advantage of providing many subjects of\\r\\nconversation in society, and of giving one an opportunity for bringing\\r\\nforward artistic generalities which appear profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time I went alone, and I arrived at Genoa at the same time as the\\r\\nyear before, but without any adventure on the road. I went to the same\\r\\nhotel, and actually happened to have the same room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was scarcely in bed when the recollection of Francesca which, since\\r\\nthe evening before, had been floating vaguely through my mind, haunted\\r\\nme with strange persistency. I thought of her nearly the whole night,\\r\\nand by degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at\\r\\nfirst, which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up\\r\\nmy mind to spend the next day in Genoa to try and find her, and if I\\r\\nshould not succeed, I would take the evening train.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning I set out on my search. I remembered the directions\\r\\nshe had given me when she left me, perfectly--Victor-Emmanuel Street,\\r\\netc., etc., house of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on\\r\\nthe right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it without the least difficulty, and I knocked at the door of a\\r\\nsomewhat dilapidated-looking dwelling. A fat woman opened it, who must\\r\\nhave been very handsome, but who actually was only very dirty. Although\\r\\nshe was too fat, she still bore the lines of majestic beauty; her untidy\\r\\nhair fell over her forehead and shoulders, and one fancied one could see\\r\\nher fat body floating about in an enormous dressing-gown covered with\\r\\nspots of dirt and grease. Round her neck she wore a great gilt necklace,\\r\\nand on her wrists were splendid bracelets of Genoa filigree work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rather a hostile manner she asked me what I wanted, and I replied by\\r\\nrequesting her to tell me whether Francesca Rondoli lived there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want with her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had the pleasure of meeting her last year, and I should like to see\\r\\nher again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman looked at me suspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you meet her?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why here, in Genoa itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated a moment, and then I told her. I had scarcely done so when\\r\\nthe Italian put out her arms as if to embrace me. \"Oh! you are the\\r\\nFrenchman; how glad I am to see you! But what grief you caused the poor\\r\\nchild. She waited for you a month; yes, a whole month. At first she\\r\\nthought you would come to fetch her. She wanted to see whether you loved\\r\\nher. If you only knew how she cried when she saw that you were not\\r\\ncoming! She cried till she seemed to have no tears left. Then she went\\r\\nto the hotel, but you had gone. She thought that most likely you were\\r\\ntraveling in Italy, and that you would return by Genoa to fetch her, as\\r\\nshe would not go with you. And she waited more than a month, Monsieur;\\r\\nand she was so unhappy; so unhappy. I am her mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI really felt a little disconcerted, but I regained my self-possession,\\r\\nand asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has gone to Paris with a painter, a delightful man, who loves her\\r\\nvery much, and who gives her everything that she wants. Just look at\\r\\nwhat she sent me; they are very pretty, are they not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she showed me, with quite Southern animation, her heavy bracelets\\r\\nand necklace. \"I have also,\" she continued, \"earrings with stones in\\r\\nthem, a silk dress, and some rings; but I only wear them on grand\\r\\noccasions. Oh! she is very happy, Sir, very happy. She will be so\\r\\npleased when I tell her you have been here. But pray come in and sit\\r\\ndown. You will take something or other, surely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I refused, as I now wished to get away by the first train; but she\\r\\ntook me by the arm and pulled me in, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please, come in; I must tell her that you have been in here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI found myself in a small, rather dark room, furnished with only a table\\r\\nand a few chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"O! She is very happy now, very happy. When you met her\\r\\nin the train she was very miserable, for her lover had just left her at\\r\\nMarseilles, and she was coming back, poor child. But she liked you at\\r\\nonce, though she was still rather sad, you understand. Now she has all\\r\\nshe wants, and she writes and tells me everything that she does. His\\r\\nname is Bellemin, and they say he is a great painter in your country. He\\r\\nmet her in the street here, and fell in love with her out of hand. But\\r\\nyou will take a glass of syrup?--it is very good. Are you quite alone,\\r\\nthis year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"quite alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt an increasing inclination to laugh, as my first disappointment\\r\\nwas dispelled by what Mother Rondoli said. I was obliged, however, to\\r\\ndrink a glass of her syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you are quite alone?\" she continued. \"How sorry I am that Francesca\\r\\nis not here now; she would have been company for you all the time you\\r\\nstayed. It is not very amusing to go about all by oneself, and she will\\r\\nbe very sorry also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting up to go, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But would you not like Carlotta to go with you? She knows all the\\r\\nwalks very well. She is my second daughter, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt she took my look of surprise for consent, for she opened the\\r\\ninner door and called out up the dark stairs which I could not see:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Carlotta! Carlotta! make haste down, my dear child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to protest, but she would not listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; she will be very glad to go with you; she is very nice, and much\\r\\nmore cheerful than her sister, and she is a good girl, a very good girl,\\r\\nwhom I love very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments, a tall, slender, dark girl appeared, with her hair\\r\\nhanging down, and whose youthful figure showed unmistakably beneath an\\r\\nold dress of her mother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter at once told her how matters stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Francesca\\'s Frenchman, you know, the one whom she knew last\\r\\nyear. He is quite alone, and has come to look for her, poor fellow; so I\\r\\ntold him that you would go with him to keep him company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked at me with her handsome dark eyes, and said, smiling:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no objection, if he wishes it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not possibly refuse, and merely said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I shall be very glad of your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother pushed her out. \"Go and get dressed directly; put on your\\r\\nblue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had left the room the old woman explained herself: \"I\\r\\nhave two others, but they are much younger. It costs a lot of money to\\r\\nbring up four children. Luckily the eldest is off my hands at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told all about herself, about her husband, who had been an\\r\\nemployé on the railway, but who was dead, and she expatiated on the good\\r\\nqualities of Carlotta, her second girl, who soon returned, dressed, as\\r\\nher sister had been, in a striking, peculiar manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother examined her from head to foot, and, after finding everything\\r\\nright, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my children, you can go.\" Then turning to the girl, she said: \"Be\\r\\nsure you are back by ten o\\'clock to-night; you know the door is locked\\r\\nthen.\" The answer was:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, mamma; don\\'t alarm yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took my arm, and we went wandering about the streets, just as I had\\r\\ndone the previous year with her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the hotel for lunch, and then I took my new friend to\\r\\nSanta Margarita, just as I had done with her sister the year previously.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she did not go home that night, although the door was to be closed\\r\\nat ten o\\'clock!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole fortnight which I had at my disposal I took Carlotta to\\r\\nall the places of interest in and about Genoa. She gave me no cause to\\r\\nregret the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cried when I left her, and the morning of my departure I gave her\\r\\nfour bracelets for her mother, besides a substantial token of my\\r\\naffection for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days I intend to return to Italy, and I cannot help\\r\\nremembering, with a certain amount of uneasiness, mingled with hope,\\r\\nthat Mme. Rondoli has two more daughters.',\n"," 'CHÂLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral de la Vallee, who seemed to be half asleep in his armchair, said\\r\\nin a voice which sounded like an old woman\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had a very singular little love adventure once; would you like to\\r\\nhear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke from the depths of his great chair, with that everlasting dry,\\r\\nwrinkled smile on his lips, that smile _à la Voltaire_, which made\\r\\npeople take him for a terrible skeptic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thirty years of age and first lieutenant in the navy, when I was\\r\\nintrusted with an astronomical expedition to Central India. The English\\r\\nGovernment provided me with all the necessary means for carrying out my\\r\\nenterprise, and I was soon busied with a few followers in that strange,\\r\\nsurprising, prodigious country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would take me ten volumes to relate that journey. I went through\\r\\nwonderfully magnificent regions, and was received by strangely handsome\\r\\nprinces, who entertained me with incredible magnificence. For two months\\r\\nit seemed to me as if I were walking in a poem, and that I was going\\r\\nabout in a fairy kingdom, on the back of imaginary elephants. In the\\r\\nmidst of wild forests I discovered extraordinary ruins, delicate and\\r\\nchiseled like jewels, fine as lace and enormous as mountains, those\\r\\nfabulous, divine monuments which are so graceful that one falls in love\\r\\nwith their form like one falls in love with a woman, and that one feels\\r\\na physical and sensual pleasure in looking at them. As Victor Hugo says,\\r\\n\"_Whilst wide-awake, I was walking in a dream_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of my journey I reached Ganhard, which was formerly one\\r\\nof the most prosperous towns in Central India, but is now much decayed\\r\\nand governed by a wealthy, arbitrary, violent, generous, and cruel\\r\\nprince. His name is Rajah Maddan, a true Oriental potentate, delicate\\r\\nand barbarous, affable and sanguinary, combining feminine grace with\\r\\npitiless ferocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city lies at the bottom of a valley, on the banks of a little lake\\r\\nwhich is surrounded by pagodas, which bathe their walls in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance the city looks like a white spot which grows larger as one\\r\\napproaches it, and by degrees one discovers the domes and spires, all\\r\\nthe slender and graceful summits of Indian monuments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about an hour\\'s distance from the gates, I met a superbly caparisoned\\r\\nelephant, surrounded by a guard of honor which the sovereign had sent\\r\\nme, and I was conducted to the palace with great ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have liked to have taken the time to put on my gala uniform,\\r\\nbut royal impatience would not admit of it. He was anxious to make my\\r\\nacquaintance, to know what he might expect from me, and then he would\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was introduced into a great hall surrounded by galleries, in the midst\\r\\nof bronze-colored soldiers in splendid uniforms, while all about were\\r\\nstanding men dressed in striking robes studded with precious stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw a shining mass, a kind of sitting sun reposing on a bench like\\r\\nour garden benches, without a back; it was the rajah who was waiting for\\r\\nme, motionless, in a robe of the purest canary color. He had some ten or\\r\\nfifteen million francs worth of diamonds on him, and by itself, on his\\r\\nforehead glistened the famous star of Delhi, which has always belonged\\r\\nto the illustrious dynasty of the Pariharas of Mundore, from whom my\\r\\nhost was descended.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about five-and-twenty, who seemed to have some negro\\r\\nblood in his veins, although he belonged to the purest Hindoo race. He\\r\\nhad large, almost motionless, rather vague eyes, fat lips, a curly\\r\\nbeard, low forehead, and dazzling sharp white teeth, which he frequently\\r\\nshowed with a mechanical smile. He got up and gave me his hand in the\\r\\nEnglish fashion, and then made me sit down beside him on a bench which\\r\\nwas so high that my feet hardly touched the ground, and I was very\\r\\nuncomfortable on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately proposed a tiger hunt for the next day; war and hunting\\r\\nwere his chief occupations, and he could hardly understand how one could\\r\\ncare for anything else. He was evidently fully persuaded that I had only\\r\\ncome all that distance to amuse him a little, and to be the companion of\\r\\nhis pleasures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood greatly in need of his assistance, I tried to flatter his\\r\\ntastes, and he was so pleased with me that he immediately wished to show\\r\\nme how his trained boxers fought, and he led the way into a kind of\\r\\narena situated within the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his command two naked men appeared, their hands covered with steel\\r\\nclaws. They immediately began to attack each other, trying to strike one\\r\\nanother with this sharp weapon, which left long cuts, from which the\\r\\nblood flowed freely down their dark skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt lasted for a long time, till their bodies were a mass of wounds, and\\r\\nthe combatants were tearing each other\\'s flesh with this sort of rake\\r\\nmade of pointed blades. One of them had his jaw smashed, while the ear\\r\\nof the other was split into three pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked on with ferocious pleasure, uttered grunts of delight,\\r\\nand imitated all their movements with careless gestures, crying out\\r\\nconstantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike, strike hard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fell down unconscious, and had to be carried out of the arena,\\r\\ncovered with blood, while the rajah uttered a sigh of regret because it\\r\\nwas over so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to me to know my opinion; I was disgusted, but I congratulated\\r\\nhim loudly. He then gave orders that I was to be conducted to\\r\\nCouch-Mahal (the palace of pleasure), where I was to be lodged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bijou palace was situated at the extremity of the royal park, and\\r\\none of its walls was built into the sacred lake of Vihara. It was\\r\\nsquare, with three rows of galleries with colonnades of most beautiful\\r\\nworkmanship. At each angle there were light, lofty or low towers,\\r\\nstanding either singly or in pairs: no two were alike, and they looked\\r\\nlike flowers growing out of that graceful plant of Oriental\\r\\narchitecture. All were surmounted by fantastic roofs, like coquettish\\r\\nladies\\' caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the edifice a large dome raised its round cupola like a\\r\\nlarge white woman\\'s breast, beside a beautiful clock-tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole building was covered with sculpture from top to bottom, with\\r\\nthose exquisite arabesques which delight the eye, of motionless\\r\\nprocessions of delicate figures whose attitudes and gestures in stone\\r\\ntold the story of Indian manners and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rooms were lighted by windows with dentelated arches, looking on to\\r\\nthe gardens. On the marble floor were designs of graceful bouquets in\\r\\nonyx, lapis-lazuli, and agate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely had time to finish my toilet when Haribada, a court\\r\\ndignitary who was specially charged to communicate between the prince\\r\\nand me, announced his sovereign\\'s visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saffron-colored rajah appeared, again shook hands with me, and began\\r\\nto tell me a thousand different things, constantly asking me for my\\r\\nopinion, which I had great difficulty in giving him. Then he wished to\\r\\nshow me the ruins of the former palace at the other extremity of the\\r\\ngardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a real forest of stones inhabited by a large tribe of apes. On\\r\\nour approach the males began to run along the walls, making the most\\r\\nhideous faces at us, while the females ran away, showing their bare\\r\\nrumps, and carrying off their young in their arms. The rajah shouted\\r\\nwith laughter and pinched my arm to draw my attention, and to testify\\r\\nhis own delight, and sat down in the midst of the ruins, while around\\r\\nus, squatting on the top of the walls, perching on every eminence, a\\r\\nnumber of animals with white whiskers put out their tongues and shook\\r\\ntheir fists at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had seen enough of this, the yellow rajah rose and began to walk\\r\\nsedately on, keeping me always at his side, happy at having shown me\\r\\nsuch things on the very day of my arrival, and reminding me that a grand\\r\\ntiger-hunt was to take place the next day, in my honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was present at it, at a second, a third, at ten, twenty in succession.\\r\\nWe hunted all the animals which the country produces in turn; the\\r\\npanther, the bear, elephant, antelope, the hippopotamus and the\\r\\ncrocodile--what do I know of, half the beasts in creation I should say.\\r\\nI was disgusted at seeing so much blood flow, and tired of this\\r\\nmonotonous pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the prince\\'s ardor abated and, at my urgent request, he left\\r\\nme a little leisure for work, and contented himself by loading me with\\r\\ncostly presents. He sent me jewels, magnificent stuffs, and well-broken\\r\\nanimals of all sorts, which Haribada presented to me with apparently as\\r\\ngrave respect as if I had been the sun himself although he heartily\\r\\ndespised me at the bottom of his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day a procession of servants brought me in covered dishes, a\\r\\nportion of each course that was served at the royal table; every day he\\r\\nseemed to take an extreme pleasure in getting up some new entertainment\\r\\nfor me--dances by the Bayaderes, jugglers, reviews of the troops, and I\\r\\nwas obliged to pretend to be most delighted with it, so as not to hurt\\r\\nhis feelings when he wished to show me his wonderful country in all its\\r\\ncharm and all its splendor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as I was left alone for a few moments I either worked or went to\\r\\nsee the monkeys, whose company pleased me a great deal better than that\\r\\nof their royal master.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, however, on coming back from a walk, I found Haribada\\r\\noutside the gate of my palace. He told me in mysterious tones that a\\r\\ngift from the king was waiting for me in my room, and he said that his\\r\\nmaster begged me to excuse him for not having sooner thought of offering\\r\\nme that of which I had been deprived for such a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these obscure remarks the ambassador bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went in I saw six little girls standing against the wall\\r\\nmotionless, side-by-side, like smelts on a skewer. The eldest was\\r\\nperhaps ten and the youngest eight years old. For the first moment I\\r\\ncould not understand why this girls\\' school had taken up its abode in my\\r\\nrooms; then, however, I divined the prince\\'s delicate attention: he had\\r\\nmade me a present of a harem, and had chosen it very young from an\\r\\nexcess of generosity. There, the more unripe the fruit is, in the higher\\r\\nestimation it is held.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I remained confused and embarrassed, ashamed in the\\r\\npresence of these children, who looked at me with great grave eyes which\\r\\nseemed already to divine what I should want of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not know what to say to them; I felt inclined to send them back;\\r\\nbut one cannot return the presents of a prince; it would have been a\\r\\nmortal insult. I was obliged, therefore, to keep them, and to install\\r\\nthis troop of children in my rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood motionless, looking at me, waiting for my orders, trying to\\r\\nread my thoughts in my eyes. Confound such a present! How dreadfully it\\r\\nwas in my way. At last, thinking that I must be looking rather\\r\\nridiculous, I asked the eldest her name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Châli,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little creature, with her beautiful skin, which was slightly\\r\\nyellow, like old ivory, was a marvel, a perfect statue, with her face\\r\\nand its long and severe lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then asked, in order to see what she would reply, and also, perhaps,\\r\\nto embarrass her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you come here for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied, in her soft, harmonious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come to be altogether at my lord\\'s disposal, and to do whatever\\r\\nhe wishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was evidently quite resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put the same question to the youngest, who answered immediately in her\\r\\nshrill voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here to do whatever you ask me, my master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one was like a little mouse, and was very taking, just as they all\\r\\nwere, so I took her in my arms and kissed her. The others made a\\r\\nmovement to go away, thinking, no doubt, that I had made my choice; but\\r\\nI ordered them to stay, and sitting down in the Indian fashion, I made\\r\\nthem all sit round me, and began to tell them fairy-tales, for I spoke\\r\\ntheir language tolerably well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey listened very attentively, and trembled, wringing their hands in\\r\\nagony. Poor little things, they were not thinking any longer of the\\r\\nreason why they were sent to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had finished my story, I called Latchmân, my confidential\\r\\nservant, and made him bring sweetmeats and cakes, of which they ate\\r\\nenough to make themselves ill; then, as I began to find the adventure\\r\\nrather funny, I organized games to amuse my wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these diversions had an enormous success. I made a bridge of my\\r\\nlegs, and the six children ran underneath, the smallest beginning and\\r\\nthe tallest always knocking against them a little, because she did not\\r\\nstoop enough. It made them shout with laughter, and these young voices\\r\\nsounding beneath the low vaults of my sumptuous palace, seemed to wake\\r\\nit up and to people it with childlike gaiety, filling it with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext I took great interest in seeing to the sleeping apartments of my\\r\\ninnocent concubines, and in the end I saw them safely locked up under\\r\\nthe surveillance of four female servants, whom the prince had sent me at\\r\\nthe same time in order to take care of my sultanas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a week I took the greatest pleasure in acting the papa towards\\r\\nthese living dolls. We had capital games of _hide-and-seek_,\\r\\n_puss-in-the-corner_, &c., which gave them the greatest pleasure, for\\r\\nevery day I taught them a new game, to their intense delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy house now seemed to be one large class, and my little friends,\\r\\ndressed in beautiful silk stuffs, and in materials embroidered with gold\\r\\nand silver, ran up and down the long galleries and the quiet rooms like\\r\\nlittle human animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one evening, without my knowing exactly how it happened, the\\r\\noldest of them, the one called Châli, and who looked so like an ivory\\r\\nstatue, became my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an adorable little creature, timid and gentle, who soon got to\\r\\nlove me ardently, with some degree of shame, with hesitation as if\\r\\nafraid of European justice, with reserve and scruples, and yet with\\r\\npassionate tenderness. I cherished her as if I had been her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg your pardon, ladies; I am going rather too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others continued to play in the palace, like a lot of happy kittens,\\r\\nand Châli never left me except when I went to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed delicious hours together in the ruins of the old castle, among\\r\\nthe monkeys, who had become our friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe used to lie on my knees, and remain there, turning all sorts of\\r\\nthings over in her little sphinx\\'s head, or perhaps not thinking of\\r\\nanything, retaining that beautiful, charming, hereditary pose of that\\r\\nnoble and dreamy people, the hieratic pose of the sacred statues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large brass dish I had brought provisions, cakes, fruits. The apes\\r\\ncame nearer and nearer, followed by their young ones, who were more\\r\\ntimid; at last they sat down round us in a circle, without daring to\\r\\ncome any nearer, waiting for me to distribute my delicacies. Then,\\r\\nalmost invariably, a male more daring than the rest would come to me\\r\\nwith outstretched hand, like a beggar, and I would give him something,\\r\\nwhich he would take to his wife. All the others immediately began to\\r\\nutter furious cries, cries of rage and jealousy; and I could not make\\r\\nthe terrible racket cease except by throwing each one his share.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was very comfortable in the ruins I had my instruments brought\\r\\nthere, so that I might be able to work. As soon, however, as they saw\\r\\nthe copper fittings on my scientific instruments, the monkeys, no doubt\\r\\ntaking them for some deadly engines, fled on all sides, uttering the\\r\\nmost piercing cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nI often also spent my evenings with Châli on one of the external\\r\\ngalleries that looked on to the lake of Vihara. Without speaking we\\r\\nlooked at the bright moon gliding over the sky and throwing a mantle of\\r\\ntrembling silver over the water, and down there, on the further shore,\\r\\nthe row of small pagodas like elegant mushrooms with their stalks in the\\r\\nwater. Taking the thoughtful head of my little mistress between my\\r\\nhands, I printed a long, soft kiss on her polished brow, on her great\\r\\neyes, which were full of the secret of that ancient and fabulous land,\\r\\nand on her calm lips which opened to my caress. I felt a confused,\\r\\npowerful, above all, a poetical, sensation, the sensation that I\\r\\npossessed a whole race in this little girl, that mysterious race from\\r\\nwhich all the others seem to have taken their origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, however, continued to load me with presents. One day he sent\\r\\nme a very unexpected object, which excited a passionate admiration in\\r\\nChâli. It was merely one of those cardboard boxes covered with shells\\r\\nstuck on outside, and they can be bought at any European seaside resort\\r\\nfor a penny or two. But there it was a jewel beyond price, and no doubt\\r\\nwas the first that had found its way into the kingdom. I put it on a\\r\\ntable and left it there, wondering at the value which was set upon this\\r\\ntrumpery article out of a bazaar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Châli never got tired of looking at it, of admiring it ecstatically.\\r\\nFrom time to time she would say to me, \"May I touch it?\" And when I had\\r\\ngiven her permission she raised the lid, closed it again with the\\r\\ngreatest precaution, touched the shells very gently, and the contact\\r\\nseemed to give her real physical pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I had finished my work, and it was time for me to return. I was\\r\\na long time in making up my mind, kept back by my tenderness for my\\r\\nlittle friend, but at last I was obliged to fix the day of my departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince got up fresh hunting excursions and fresh wrestling matches,\\r\\nand after a fortnight of these pleasures I declared that I could stay no\\r\\nlonger, and he gave me my liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy farewell from Châli was heartrending. She wept, lying beside me, with\\r\\nher head on my breast, shaken with sobs. I did not know how to console\\r\\nher; my kisses were no good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an idea struck me, and getting up I went and got the\\r\\nshell-box, and putting it into her hands, I said, \"That is for you; it\\r\\nis yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw her smile at first. Her whole face was lighted up with\\r\\ninternal joy, with that profound joy when impossible dreams are suddenly\\r\\nrealized, and she embraced me ardently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, she wept bitterly when I bade her a last farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave paternal kisses and cakes to all the rest of my wives, and then I\\r\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years had passed when my duties again called me to Bombay, and,\\r\\nbecause I knew the country and the language well, I was left there to\\r\\nundertake another mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finished what I had to do as quickly as possible, and as I had a\\r\\nconsiderable amount of spare time on my hands I determined to go and see\\r\\nmy friend the King of Ganhard and my dear little Châli once more, though\\r\\nI expected to find her much changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rajah received me with every demonstration of pleasure, and hardly\\r\\nleft me for a moment during the first day of my visit. At night,\\r\\nhowever, when I was alone, I sent for Haribada, and after several\\r\\nmisleading questions I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know what has become of little Châli, whom the rajah gave me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately assumed a sad and troubled look, and said, in evident\\r\\nembarrassment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had better not speak of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why? She was a dear little woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She turned out badly, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--Châli? What has become of her? Where is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean to say that she came to a bad end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bad end! Is she dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. She committed a very dreadful action.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very much distressed. I felt my heart beat, and my breast was\\r\\noppressed with grief, and insisted on knowing what she had done and what\\r\\nhad happened to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man became more and more embarrassed, and murmured, \"You had better\\r\\nnot ask about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She stole--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who--Châli? What did she steal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something that belonged to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me? What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day you left she stole that little box which the prince had given\\r\\nyou; it was found in her hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What box are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The box covered with shells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I gave it to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian looked at me with stupefaction, then replied: \"Well, she\\r\\ndeclared with the most sacred oaths that you had given it to her, but\\r\\nnobody could believe that you could have given a king\\'s present to a\\r\\nslave, and so the rajah had her punished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was she punished? What was done to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was tied up in a sack, and thrown into the lake from this window,\\r\\nfrom the window of the room in which we are, where she had committed the\\r\\ntheft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt the most terrible grief that I ever experienced, and I made a\\r\\nsign to Haribada to go away, so that he might not see my tears; and I\\r\\nspent the night on the gallery that looked on to the lake, on the\\r\\ngallery where I had so often held the poor child on my knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pictured to myself her pretty little body lying decomposed in a sack\\r\\nin the dark waters beneath me, which we had so often looked at together\\r\\nformerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day I left again, in spite of the rajah\\'s entreaties and\\r\\nevident vexation; and I now still feel as if I had never loved any woman\\r\\nbut Châli.',\n"," 'THE UMBRELLA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille was a very economical woman; she thoroughly knew the value\\r\\nof a halfpenny, and possessed a whole storehouse of strict principles\\r\\nwith regard to the multiplication of money, so that her cook found the\\r\\ngreatest difficulty in making what the servants call their\\r\\n_market-penny_, while her husband was hardly allowed any pocket-money at\\r\\nall. They were, however, very comfortably off, and had no children; but\\r\\nit really pained Mme. Oreille to see any money spent; it was like\\r\\ntearing at her heartstrings when she had to take any of those nice\\r\\ncrown-pieces out of her pocket; and whenever she had to spend anything,\\r\\nno matter how necessary it was, she slept badly the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was continually saying to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really might be more liberal, as we have no children, and never\\r\\nspend our income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know what may happen,\" she used to reply. \"It is better to\\r\\nhave too much than too little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little woman of about forty, very active, rather hasty,\\r\\nwrinkled, very neat and tidy, and with a very short temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband very often used to complain of all the privations she made\\r\\nhim endure; some of them were particularly painful to him, as they\\r\\ntouched his vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was one of the upper clerks in the War Office, and only kept on there\\r\\nin obedience to his wife\\'s wish, so as to increase their income, which\\r\\nthey did not nearly spend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched\\r\\numbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow-clerks. At last he got\\r\\ntired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife buying him a new one.\\r\\nShe bought one for eight francs and a half, one of those cheap articles\\r\\nwhich large houses sell as an advertisement. When the others in the\\r\\noffice saw the article, which was being sold in Paris by the thousands,\\r\\nthey began their jokes again, and Oreille had a dreadful time of it with\\r\\nthem, and they even made a song about it, which he heard from morning\\r\\ntill night all over the immense building.\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new\\r\\none, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so\\r\\nthat he might see that it was all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger\\r\\nas she gave it to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will last you for five years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille felt quite triumphant, and obtained a small ovation at the\\r\\noffice with his new acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he went home in the evening, his wife said to him, looking at the\\r\\numbrella uneasily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very\\r\\nlikely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a\\r\\nnew one in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, unfastened it, and remained dumbfounded with astonishment\\r\\nand rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a\\r\\nsixpenny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband replied quietly, without looking at it: \"What is it? What do\\r\\nyou mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was choking with rage, and could hardly get out a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--you--have burnt--your umbrella! Why--you must be--mad! Do you wish\\r\\nto ruin us outright?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round, and felt that he was growing pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say that you have burnt your umbrella. Just look here--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rushing at him as if she were going to beat him, she violently\\r\\nthrust the little circular burnt hole under his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so utterly struck dumb at the sight of it that he could only\\r\\nstammer out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--what is it? How should I know? I have done nothing, I will swear.\\r\\nI don\\'t know what is the matter with the umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been playing tricks with it at the office; you have been\\r\\nplaying the fool and opening it, to show it off,\" she screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only opened it once, to let them see what a nice one it was, that is\\r\\nall, I declare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she shook with rage, and got up one of those conjugal scenes which\\r\\nmake a peaceable man dread the domestic hearth more than a battlefield\\r\\nwhere bullets are raining.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mended it with a piece of silk cut out of the old umbrella, which\\r\\nwas of a different color, and the next day Oreille went off very humbly\\r\\nwith the mended article in his hand. He put it into a cupboard, and\\r\\nthought no more about it than one thinks of some unpleasant\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the\\r\\numbrella from him, opened it, and nearly had a fit when she saw what had\\r\\nbefallen it, for the disaster was irreparable. It was covered with small\\r\\nholes, which, evidently, proceeded from burns, just as if someone had\\r\\nemptied the ashes from a lighted pipe on to it. It was done for utterly,\\r\\nirreparably.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at it without a word, in too great a passion to be able to\\r\\nsay anything. He also, when he saw the damage, remained almost struck\\r\\nstupid, in a state of frightened consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other, then he looked on to the floor; and the next\\r\\nmoment she threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a\\r\\ntransport of the most violent rage, for she had recovered her voice by\\r\\nthat time:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you brute! you brute! You did it on purpose, but I will pay you out\\r\\nfor it. You shall not have another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the scene began again, and after the storm had raged for an\\r\\nhour, he, at last, was enabled to explain himself. He declared that he\\r\\ncould not understand it at all, and that it could only proceed from\\r\\nmalice or from vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ring at the bell saved him; it was a friend whom they were expecting\\r\\nfor dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Oreille submitted the case to him. As for buying a new umbrella,\\r\\nthat was out of the question; her husband should not have another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend very sensibly said that in that case his clothes would be\\r\\nspoilt, and they were certainly worth more than the umbrella. But the\\r\\nlittle woman, who was still in a rage, replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then, when it rains he may have the kitchen umbrella, for I\\r\\nwill not give him a new silk one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOreille utterly rebelled at such an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said; \"then I shall resign my post. I am not going to\\r\\nthe office with the kitchen umbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend interposed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have this one re-covered; it will not cost much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mme. Oreille, being in the temper that she was, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will cost at least eight francs to re-cover it. Eight and eighteen\\r\\nare twenty-six. Just fancy, twenty-six francs for an umbrella! It is\\r\\nutter madness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend, who was only a poor man of the middle-classes, had an\\r\\ninspiration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make your Fire Assurance pay for it. The companies pay for all articles\\r\\nthat are burnt, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this advice the little woman calmed down immediately, and\\r\\nthen, after a moment\\'s reflection, she said to her husband:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, before going to your office, you will go to the _Maternelle_\\r\\nAssurance Company, show them the state your umbrella is in, and make\\r\\nthem pay for the damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Oreille fairly jumped, he was so startled at the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not do it for my life! It is eighteen francs lost that is all.\\r\\nIt will not ruin us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he took a walking-stick when he went out, and, luckily,\\r\\nit was a fine day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft at home alone, Mme. Oreille could not get over the loss of her\\r\\neighteen francs by any means. She had put the umbrella on the\\r\\ndining-room table, and she looked at it without being able to come to\\r\\nany determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment she thought of the Assurance Company, but she did not dare\\r\\nto encounter the quizzical looks of the gentlemen who might receive her,\\r\\nfor she was very timid before people, and grew red at a mere nothing,\\r\\nand was embarrassed when she had to speak to strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she\\r\\nhad been wounded. She tried not to think of it any more, and yet every\\r\\nmoment the recollection of the loss struck her painfully. What was she\\r\\nto do, however? Time went on, and she could not decide; but suddenly,\\r\\nlike all cowards, on becoming determined, she made up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go, and we will see what will happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the\\r\\ndisaster might be complete, and the reason of it quite evident. She took\\r\\na match from the mantelpiece, and between the ribs she burnt a hole as\\r\\nbig as the palm of her hand; then she delicately rolled it up, fastened\\r\\nit with the elastic band, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quickly\\r\\ntowards the Rue de Rivoli, where the Assurance Office was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the nearer she got the slower she walked. What was she going to say,\\r\\nand what reply would she get?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the numbers of the houses; there were still twenty-eight.\\r\\nThat was all right, so she had time to consider, and she walked slower\\r\\nand slower. Suddenly she saw a door on which was a large brass plate\\r\\nwith \"_La Maternelle_ Fire Assurance Office\" engraved on it. Already!\\r\\nShe waited for a moment, for she felt nervous and almost ashamed; then\\r\\nshe went past, came back, went past again, and came back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she said to herself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go in, however, so I may as well do it sooner as later.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not help noticing, however, how her heart beat as she entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went into an enormous room with grated wicket openings all round,\\r\\nand a man behind each of them, and as a gentleman, carrying a number of\\r\\npapers, passed her, she stopped him and said, timidly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, Monsieur, but can you tell me where I must apply for\\r\\npayment for anything that has been accidentally burnt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a sonorous voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first door on the left; that is the department you want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis frightened her still more, and she felt inclined to run away, to\\r\\nmake no claim, to sacrifice her eighteen francs. But the idea of that\\r\\nsum revived her courage, and she went upstairs, out of breath, stopping\\r\\nat almost every other step.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knocked at a door which she saw on the first landing, and a clear\\r\\nvoice said, in answer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three\\r\\nsolemn gentlemen, all with a decoration in their buttonholes, were\\r\\nstanding talking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them asked her: \"What do you want, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly get out her words, but stammered: \"I have come--I have\\r\\ncome on account of an accident, something--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe very politely pointed out a seat to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will kindly sit down I will attend to you in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, returning to the other two, he went on with the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Company, gentlemen, does not consider that it is under any\\r\\nobligation to you for more than four hundred thousand francs, and we can\\r\\npay no attention to your claim to the further sum of a hundred thousand,\\r\\nwhich you wish to make us pay. Besides that, the surveyor\\'s valuation--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the others interrupted him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite enough, Monsieur; the Law Courts will decide between us,\\r\\nand we have nothing further to do than to take your leave.\" And they\\r\\nwent out after mutual ceremonious bows.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If she could only have gone away with them, how gladly she would\\r\\nhave done it; she would have run away and given up everything. But it\\r\\nwas too late, for the gentleman came back, and said, bowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for you, Madame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could scarcely speak, but at last she managed to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come--for this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager looked at the object which she held out to him in mute\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith trembling fingers she tried to undo the elastic, and succeeded,\\r\\nafter several attempts, and hastily opened the damaged remains of the\\r\\numbrella.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks to me to be in a very bad state of health,\" he said,\\r\\ncompassionately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It cost me twenty francs,\" she said, with some hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished. \"Really! As much as that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was a capital article, and I wanted you to see the state it is\\r\\nin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, I see; very well. But I really do not understand what it can\\r\\nhave to do with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this Company did not pay for\\r\\nsuch small articles, and she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--it is burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not deny it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that very well,\" he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remained open-mouthed, not knowing what to say next; then suddenly\\r\\nforgetting that she had left out the main thing, she said hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Mme. Oreille; we are assured in _La Maternelle_, and I have come\\r\\nto claim the value of this damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to have it re-covered,\" she added quickly, fearing a\\r\\npositive refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager was rather embarrassed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, really, Madame, we do not sell umbrellas; we cannot undertake such\\r\\nkinds of repairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little woman felt her courage reviving; she was not going to give up\\r\\nwithout a struggle; she was not even afraid any more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only want you to pay me the cost of repairing it; I can quite well\\r\\nget it done myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman seemed rather confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Madame, it is such a very small matter! We are never asked to\\r\\ngive compensation for such trivial losses. You must allow that we cannot\\r\\nmake good pocket-handkerchiefs, gloves, brooms, slippers, all the small\\r\\narticles which are every day exposed to the chances of being burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red, and felt inclined to fly into a rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Monsieur, last December one of our chimneys caught fire, and\\r\\ncaused at least five hundred francs\\' damage; M. Oreille made no claim on\\r\\nthe Company, and so it is only just that it should pay for my umbrella\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager, guessing that she was telling a lie, said, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must acknowledge, Madame, that it is very surprising that M.\\r\\nOreille should have asked no compensation for damages amounting to five\\r\\nhundred francs, and should now claim five or six francs for mending an\\r\\numbrella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not the least put out, and replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg pardon, Monsieur, the five hundred francs affected M. Oreille\\'s\\r\\npocket, whereas this damage, amounting to eighteen francs, concerns Mme.\\r\\nOreille\\'s pocket only, which is a totally different matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he saw that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would\\r\\nonly be wasting his time, he said, resignedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you kindly tell me how the damage was done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt that she had won the victory, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is how it happened, Monsieur: In our hall there is a bronze\\r\\nstick-and umbrella-stand, and the other day, when I came in, I put my\\r\\numbrella into it. I must tell you that just above there is a shelf for\\r\\nthe candlesticks and matches. I put out my hand, took three or four\\r\\nmatches, and struck one, but it missed fire, so I struck another, which\\r\\nignited, but went out immediately, and a third did the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager interrupted her, to make a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose they were Government matches, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not understand him, and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely. At any rate, the fourth caught fire, and I lit my candle,\\r\\nand went into my room to go to bed; but in a quarter-of-an-hour I\\r\\nfancied that I smelt something burning, and I have always been terribly\\r\\nafraid of fire. If ever we have an accident it will not be my fault, I\\r\\nassure you. I am terribly nervous since our chimney was on fire, as I\\r\\ntold you; so I got up, and hunted about everywhere, sniffing like a dog\\r\\nafter game, and at last I noticed that my umbrella was burning. Most\\r\\nlikely a match had fallen between the folds and burnt it. You can see\\r\\nhow it has damaged it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager had taken his clue, and asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you estimate the damage at?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not know what to say, as she was not certain what amount to put\\r\\non it, but at last she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you had better get it done yourself. I will leave it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, naturally refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Madame, I cannot do that. Tell me the amount of your claim, that is\\r\\nall I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!--I think that--Look here, Monsieur, I do not want to make any\\r\\nmoney out of you, so I will tell you what we will do. I will take my\\r\\numbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it in good, durable silk, and\\r\\nI will bring the bill to you. Will that suit you, Monsieur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly, Madame; we will settle it so. Here is a note for the\\r\\ncashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave Mme. Oreille a slip of paper, who took it, got up and went out,\\r\\nthanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good\\r\\numbrella-maker, and when she found a shop which appeared to be a first\\r\\nclass one, she went in, and said, confidently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want this umbrella recovered in silk, good silk. Use the very best\\r\\nand strongest you have; I don\\'t mind what it costs.\"',\n"," 'MY UNCLE SOSTHENES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Uncle Sosthenes was a Freethinker, like so many others are, from pure\\r\\nstupidity; people are very often religious in the same way. The mere\\r\\nsight of a priest threw him into a violent rage; he shook his fist and\\r\\ngrimaced at him, and touched a piece of iron when the priest\\'s back was\\r\\nturned, forgetting that the latter action showed a belief after all, the\\r\\nbelief in the evil eye. Now when beliefs are unreasonable one should\\r\\nhave all or none at all. I myself am a Freethinker; I revolt at all the\\r\\ndogmas which have invented the fear of death, but I feel no anger\\r\\ntowards places of worship, be they Catholic, Apostolic, Roman,\\r\\nProtestant, Greek, Russian, Buddhist, Jewish, or Mohammedan. I have a\\r\\npeculiar manner of looking at them and explaining them. A place of\\r\\nworship represents the homage paid by man to THE UNKNOWN. The more\\r\\nextended our thoughts and our views become, the more _the unknown_\\r\\ndiminishes, and the more places of worship will decay. I, however, in\\r\\nthe place of church furniture, in the place of pulpits, reading desks,\\r\\naltars, and so on, would fit them up with telescopes, microscopes, and\\r\\nelectrical machines; that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and I differed on nearly every point. He was a patriot, while I\\r\\nwas not, for after all patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg\\r\\nfrom which wars are hatched.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was a Freemason, and I used to declare that they are stupider\\r\\nthan old women devotees. That is my opinion, and I maintain it; if we\\r\\nmust have any religion at all the old one is good enough for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is their object? Mutual help to be obtained by tickling the palms\\r\\nof each other\\'s hands. I see no harm in it, for they put into practice\\r\\nthe Christian precept: \"Do unto others as ye would they should do unto\\r\\nyou.\" The only difference consists in the tickling, but it does not seem\\r\\nworth while to make such a fuss about lending a poor devil half-a-crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all my arguments my uncle\\'s reply used to be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are raising up a religion against a religion; Freethought will kill\\r\\nclericalism. Freemasonry is the headquarters of those who are\\r\\ndemolishing all deities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear uncle,\" I would reply (in my heart I felt inclined\\r\\nto say, \"You old idiot!\"); \"it is just that which I am blaming you for.\\r\\nInstead of destroying, you are organizing competition; it is only a case\\r\\nof lowering the prices. And then, if you only admitted Freethinkers\\r\\namong you I could understand it, but you admit anybody. You have a\\r\\nnumber of Catholics among you, even the leaders of the party. Pius IX.\\r\\nis said to have been one of you before he became Pope. If you call a\\r\\nsociety with such an organization a bulwark against clericalism, I think\\r\\nit is an extremely weak one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" my uncle would reply, with a wink, \"our most formidable\\r\\nactions are political; slowly and surely we are everywhere undermining\\r\\nthe monarchical spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I broke out: \"Yes, you are very clever! If you tell me that\\r\\nFreemasonry is an election-machine, I will grant it you. I will never\\r\\ndeny that it is used as a machine to control stove for candidates of\\r\\nall shades; if you say that it is only used to hoodwink people, to drill\\r\\nthem to go to the voting-urn as soldiers are sent under fire, I agree\\r\\nwith you; if you declare that it is indispensable to all political\\r\\nambitions because it changes all its members into electoral agents, I\\r\\nshould say to you, \\'That is as clear as the sun.\\' But when you tell me\\r\\nthat it serves to undermine the monarchical spirit, I can only laugh in\\r\\nyour face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just consider that vast and democratic association which had Prince\\r\\nNapoleon for its Grand Master under the Empire; which has the Crown\\r\\nPrince for its Grand Master in Germany, the Czar\\'s brother in Russia,\\r\\nand to which the Prince of Wales and King Humbert and nearly all the\\r\\nroyalists of the globe belong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right,\" my uncle said; \"but all these persons are serving\\r\\nour projects without guessing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt inclined to tell him he was talking a pack of nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, however, indeed a sight to see my uncle when he had a Freemason\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn meeting they shook hands in a manner that was irresistibly funny; one\\r\\ncould see that they were going through a series of secret mysterious\\r\\npressures. When I wished to put my uncle in a rage, I had only to tell\\r\\nhim that dogs also have a manner which savors very much of Freemasonry,\\r\\nwhen they greet one another on meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen my uncle would take his friend into a corner to tell him something\\r\\nimportant, and at dinner they had a peculiar way of looking at each\\r\\nother, and of drinking to each other, in a manner as if to say: \"We know\\r\\nall about it, don\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to think that there are millions on the face of the globe who are\\r\\namused at such monkey tricks! I would sooner be a Jesuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in our town there really was an old Jesuit who was my uncle\\'s\\r\\ndetestation. Every time he met him, or if he only saw him at a distance,\\r\\nhe used to say: \"Go on, you toad!\" And then, taking my arm, he would\\r\\nwhisper to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, that fellow will play me a trick some day or other, I feel\\r\\nsure of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle spoke quite truly, and this was how it happened and through my\\r\\nfault also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a\\r\\ndinner on Good Friday, a real dinner with his favorite chitterlings and\\r\\nblackpuddings. I resisted as much as I could, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall eat meat on that day, but at home, quite by myself. Your\\r\\n_manifestation_, as you call it, is an idiotic idea. Why should you\\r\\nmanifest? What does it matter to you if people do not eat any meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my uncle would not be persuaded. He asked three of his friends to\\r\\ndine with him at one of the best restaurants in the town, and as he was\\r\\ngoing to pay the bill, I had certainly, after all, no scruples about\\r\\n_manifesting_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt four o\\'clock we took a conspicuous place in the most frequented\\r\\nrestaurant in the town, and my uncle ordered dinner in a loud voice for\\r\\nsix o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat down punctually, and at ten o\\'clock he had not finished yet. Five\\r\\nof us had drunk eighteen bottles of fine still wines, and four of\\r\\nchampagne. Then my uncle proposed what he was in the habit of calling:\\r\\n\"The archbishop\\'s turn.\" Each man put six small glasses in front of him,\\r\\neach of them filled with a different liquor, and then they had all to be\\r\\nemptied at one gulp, one after another, while one of the waiters counted\\r\\ntwenty. It was very stupid, but my uncle thought it was very suitable to\\r\\nthe occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven o\\'clock he was as drunk as a fly. So we had to take him home\\r\\nin a cab and put him to bed, and one could easily foresee that his\\r\\nanti-clerical demonstration would end in a terrible fit of indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was going back to my lodgings, being rather drunk myself, with a\\r\\ncheerful Machiavelian drunkenness which quite satisfied all my instincts\\r\\nof skepticism, an idea struck me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI arranged my necktie, put on a look of great distress, and went and\\r\\nrang loudly at the old Jesuit\\'s door. As he was deaf he made me wait a\\r\\nlong while, but at length he appeared at his window in a cotton nightcap\\r\\nand asked what I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shouted out at the top of my voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make haste, reverend Sir, and open the door; a poor, despairing, sick\\r\\nman is in need of your spiritual ministrations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good, kind man put on his trousers as quickly as he could, and came\\r\\ndown without his cassock. I told him in a breathless voice that my\\r\\nuncle, the Freethinker, had been taken suddenly ill, and fearing it was\\r\\ngoing to be something serious he had been seized with a sudden fear of\\r\\ndeath, and wished to see him and talk to him; to have his advice and\\r\\ncomfort, to make his peace with the Church, and to confess, so as to be\\r\\nable to cross the dreaded threshold at peace with himself; and I added\\r\\nin a mocking tone:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate he wishes it, and if it does him no good it can do him no\\r\\nharm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Jesuit, who was startled, delighted, and almost trembling, said\\r\\nto me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a moment, my son, I will come with you;\" but I replied: \"Pardon\\r\\nme, reverend Father, if I do not go with you; but my convictions will\\r\\nnot allow me to do so. I even refused to come and fetch you; so I beg\\r\\nyou not to say that you have seen me, but to declare that you had a\\r\\npresentiment--a sort of revelation of his illness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest consented, and went off quickly, knocked at my uncle\\'s door,\\r\\nand was soon let in; and I saw the black cassock disappear within that\\r\\nstronghold of Freethought.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hid under a neighboring gateway to wait for events. Had he been well,\\r\\nmy uncle would have half-murdered the Jesuit, but I knew that he would\\r\\nscarcely be able to move an arm, and I asked myself, gleefully, what\\r\\nsort of a scene would take place between these antagonists, what\\r\\nexplanation would be given? and what would be the issue of the situation\\r\\nwhich my uncle\\'s indignation would render more tragic still?\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed till I had to hold my sides, and said to myself, half aloud:\\r\\n\"Oh! what a joke, what a joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile it was getting very cold, and I noticed that the Jesuit stayed\\r\\na long time, and thought: \"They are having an explanation, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, two, three hours passed, and still the reverend Father did not come\\r\\nout. What had happened? Had my uncle died in a fit when he saw him, or\\r\\nhad he killed the cassocked gentleman? Perhaps they had mutually\\r\\ndevoured each other? This last supposition appeared very unlikely, for\\r\\nI fancied that my uncle was quite incapable of swallowing a grain more\\r\\nnourishment at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the day broke.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very uneasy, and, not venturing to go into the house myself, I\\r\\nwent to one of my friends who lived opposite. I knocked him up,\\r\\nexplained matters to him, much to his amusement and astonishment, and\\r\\ntook possession of his window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine o\\'clock he relieved me, and I got a little sleep. At two o\\'clock\\r\\nI, in my turn, replaced him. We were utterly astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six o\\'clock the Jesuit left, with a very happy and satisfied look on\\r\\nhis face, and we saw him go away with a quiet step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, timid and ashamed, I went and knocked at my uncle\\'s door; and when\\r\\nthe servant opened it I did not dare to ask her any questions, but went\\r\\nupstairs without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was lying pale, exhausted, with weary, sorrowful eyes and heavy\\r\\narms, on his bed. A little religious picture was fastened to one of the\\r\\nbed-curtains with a pin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, uncle,\" I said, \"you in bed still? Are you not well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied in a feeble voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear boy, I have been very ill, nearly dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was that, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know; it was most surprising. But, what is stranger still is,\\r\\nthat the Jesuit priest who has just left--you know, that excellent man\\r\\nwhom I have made such fun of--had a divine revelation of my state, and\\r\\ncame to see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, and with\\r\\ndifficulty said: \"Oh, really!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he came. He heard a Voice telling him to get up and come to me,\\r\\nbecause I was going to die. It was a revelation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pretended to sneeze, so as not to burst out laughing; I felt inclined\\r\\nto roll on the ground with amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about a minute I managed to say, indignantly: \"And you received him,\\r\\nuncle, you? You, a Freethinker, a Freemason? You did not have him thrown\\r\\nout-of-doors?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen a moment, it is so astonishing--so astonishing and providential!\\r\\nHe also spoke to me about my father; it seems he knew him formerly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father, uncle? But that is no reason for receiving a Jesuit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that, but I was very ill, and he looked after me most devotedly\\r\\nall night long. He was perfect; no doubt he saved my life; those men are\\r\\nall a little bit of a doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! he looked after you all night? But you said just now that he had\\r\\nonly been gone a very short time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is quite true; I kept him to breakfast after all his kindness. He\\r\\nhad it at a table by my bedside while I drank a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he ate meat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle looked vexed, as if I had said something very much out of\\r\\nplace, and then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t joke, Gaston; such things are out of place at times. He has shown\\r\\nme more devotion than many a relation would have done, and I expect to\\r\\nhave his convictions respected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather upset me, but I answered, nevertheless: \"Very well, uncle;\\r\\nand what did you do after breakfast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We played a game of bezique, and then he repeated his breviary while I\\r\\nread a little book which he happened to have in his pocket, and which\\r\\nwas not by any means badly written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A religious book, uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and no, or rather--no. It is the history of their missions in\\r\\nCentral Africa, and is rather a book of travels and adventures. What\\r\\nthese men have done is very grand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to feel that matters were going badly, so I got up. \"Well,\\r\\ngood-bye, uncle,\" I said, \"I see you are going to leave Freemasonry for\\r\\nreligion; you are a renegade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still rather confused, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but religion is a sort of Freemasonry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When is your Jesuit coming back?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t--I don\\'t know exactly; to-morrow, perhaps; but it is not\\r\\ncertain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out, altogether overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy joke turned out very badly for me! My uncle became radically\\r\\nconverted, and if that had been all I should not have cared so much.\\r\\nClerical or Freemason, to me it is all the same; six of one and\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen of the other; but the worst of it is that he has just made\\r\\nhis will--yes, made his will--and he has disinherited me in favor of\\r\\nthat rascally Jesuit!',\n"," 'HE?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear friend, you cannot understand it by any possible means, you say,\\r\\nand I perfectly believe you. You think I am going mad? It may be so, but\\r\\nnot for the reasons which you suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I am going to get married, and I will give you what has led me to\\r\\ntake that step.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy ideas and my convictions have not changed at all. I look upon all\\r\\nlegalized cohabitation as utterly stupid, for I am certain that nine\\r\\nhusbands out of ten are cuckolds; and they get no more than their\\r\\ndeserts for having been idiotic enough to fetter their lives, and\\r\\nrenounce their freedom in love, the only happy and good thing in the\\r\\nworld, and for having clipped the wings of fancy, which continually\\r\\ndrives us on towards all women, &c., &c., &c. You know what I mean. More\\r\\nthan ever I feel that I am incapable of loving one woman alone, because\\r\\nI shall always adore all the others too much. I should like to have a\\r\\nthousand arms, a thousand mouths, and a thousand--_temperaments_, to be\\r\\nable to strain an army of these charming creatures in my embrace at the\\r\\nsame moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet I am going to get married!\\r\\n\\r\\nI may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my\\r\\nwife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that\\r\\nthere is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my\\r\\npurpose. She is small, fair, and stout; so of course the day after\\r\\nto-morrow I shall ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is not rich, and belongs to the middle-classes. She is a girl such\\r\\nas you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any\\r\\napparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say\\r\\nof her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,\" and to-morrow they will say: \"What\\r\\na very nice woman Madame Raymon is.\" She belongs, in a word, to that\\r\\nimmense number of girls whom one is glad to have for one\\'s wife till the\\r\\nmoment comes, when one discovers that one happens to prefer all the\\r\\nother women to that particular woman whom one has married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" you will say to me, \"what on earth did you get married for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason\\r\\nthat urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am\\r\\nfrightened of being alone!\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state\\r\\nof mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not want to be alone any longer at night; I want to feel that there\\r\\nis someone close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say\\r\\nsomething, no matter what it be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able\\r\\nto ask some sudden question, a stupid question even if I feel inclined,\\r\\nso that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking\\r\\nsoul close to me, someone whose reason is at work; so that when I\\r\\nhastily light the candle I may see some human face by my\\r\\nside--because--because--I am ashamed to confess it--because I am afraid\\r\\nof being alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! you don\\'t understand me yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room I\\r\\nshould kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I\\r\\nbelieve in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I\\r\\nbelieve in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from\\r\\nthe face of this earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell,--yes, well, it must be told; I am afraid of myself, afraid of that\\r\\nhorrible sensation of incomprehensible fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I\\r\\nam afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects, which\\r\\nare animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above\\r\\nall, I am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems\\r\\nas if it were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and\\r\\ninvisible agony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind which causes a cold shiver\\r\\nto run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be seen,\\r\\nand I wish there were something there, no matter what, as long as it\\r\\nwere something tangible: I am frightened, merely because I cannot\\r\\nunderstand my own terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I\\r\\nknow not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or\\r\\nunder my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and\\r\\nI turn round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although\\r\\nthere is nothing there, and I know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get agitated; I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself up\\r\\nin my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes, and there,\\r\\ncowering down rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and remain\\r\\nthus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight on the\\r\\ntable by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet--I dare not\\r\\ndo it!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly I felt nothing of all that; I came home quite comfortably, and\\r\\nwent up and down in my rooms without anything disturbing my calmness of\\r\\nmind. Had anyone told me that I should be attacked by a malady--for I\\r\\ncan call it nothing else--of most improbable fear, such a stupid and\\r\\nterrible malady as it is, I should have laughed outright. I was\\r\\ncertainly never afraid of opening the door in the dark; I went to bed\\r\\nslowly without locking it, and never got up in the middle of the night\\r\\nto make sure that everything was firmly closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began last year in a very strange manner, on a damp autumn evening.\\r\\nWhen my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself\\r\\nwhat I was going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time,\\r\\nfeeling tired without any reason for it, unable to work, and even\\r\\nwithout energy to read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a\\r\\nprey to one of those fits of despondency, without any apparent cause\\r\\nwhich makes us feel inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so\\r\\nas to shake off our depressing thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than\\r\\nthey had ever done before, while I was surrounded by a sensation of\\r\\ninfinite and overwhelming solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but\\r\\nthen a kind of nervous impatience agitated my legs, so I got up and\\r\\nbegan to walk about again. I was rather feverish, for my hands, which I\\r\\nhad clasped behind me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost\\r\\nseemed to burn one another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my\\r\\nback, and I thought the damp air might have penetrated into my room, so\\r\\nI lit the fire for the first time that year, and sat down again and\\r\\nlooked at the flames. But soon I felt that I could not possibly remain\\r\\nquiet, and so I got up again and determined to go out, to pull myself\\r\\ntogether, and to find a friend to bear me company.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not find anyone, so I went on to the boulevards to try and meet\\r\\nsome acquaintance or other there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the\\r\\ngaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay\\r\\nheavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light from the lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on slowly, saying to myself, \"I shall not find a soul to talk\\r\\nto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced into several cafés, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg\\r\\nPoissonière, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the\\r\\ntables, who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the\\r\\nrefreshments they had ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I\\r\\nstarted off for home; I was very calm and very tired. My concierge[9]\\r\\nopened the door at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought\\r\\nthat another lodger had no doubt just come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it\\r\\nmerely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had\\r\\nbeen brought up for me in the course of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, and found my fire still burning, so that it lighted up the\\r\\nroom a little, and, in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed somebody\\r\\nsitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his back\\r\\ntowards me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought very naturally\\r\\nthat some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, whom\\r\\nI had told when I went out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I\\r\\nremembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had\\r\\nbeen opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched, and not\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone\\r\\nto sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw\\r\\nhim quite clearly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were\\r\\ncrossed, while his head, which was somewhat inclined to the left of the\\r\\narmchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. \"Who can it be?\" I\\r\\nasked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather dark, so I\\r\\nput out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in contact\\r\\nwith the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if some\\r\\nterrible danger had suddenly appeared in my way; then I turned round\\r\\nagain, impelled by some imperious desire of looking at the armchair\\r\\nagain, and I remained standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that\\r\\nI could not collect my thoughts, and ready to drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: \"It is a mere\\r\\nhallucination, that is all,\" and I immediately began to reflect about\\r\\nthis phenomenon. Thoughts fly very quickly at such moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been suffering from a hallucination, that was an incontestable\\r\\nfact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and\\r\\nlogically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only\\r\\nmy eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those\\r\\nvisions which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous\\r\\naccident to the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather\\r\\ncongested, perhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in so doing, I\\r\\nnoticed that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if\\r\\nsomebody had touched me from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly not by any means quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I double-locked my door, and felt rather reassured; now, at any\\r\\nrate, nobody could come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down again, and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I\\r\\nwent to bed, and blew out my light.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but then an\\r\\nirresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned on to\\r\\nmy side.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light\\r\\non to the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken, for there was nothing\\r\\nthere; I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to\\r\\nget to sleep as the room was now dark, but I had not forgotten myself\\r\\nfor more than five minutes when in my dream I saw all the scene which I\\r\\nhad witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up with a start,\\r\\nand having lit the candle, I sat up in bed, without venturing even to\\r\\ntry and go to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself,\\r\\nand twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad;\\r\\nwhen day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept\\r\\npeacefully till noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare; I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what. I had been ill, in a word, but yet I thought that I was\\r\\na great fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening; I went and dined at a\\r\\nrestaurant; afterwards I went to the theater, and then started home. But\\r\\nas I got near the house I was seized by a strange feeling of uneasiness\\r\\nonce more; I was afraid of _seeing_ him again. I was not afraid of him,\\r\\nnot afraid of his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid\\r\\nof being deceived again; I was afraid of some fresh hallucination,\\r\\nafraid lest fear should take possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then I\\r\\nthought that I was really too foolish, and at last I returned home. I\\r\\npanted so that I could scarcely get upstairs, and I remained standing\\r\\noutside my door for more than ten minutes; then suddenly I took courage,\\r\\nand screwed myself together. I inserted my key into the lock, and went\\r\\nin with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my half-open bedroom door,\\r\\nand gave a frightened look towards the fireplace; there was nothing\\r\\nthere. A--h!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a relief and what a delight! What a deliverance! I walked up and\\r\\ndown briskly and boldly, but I was not altogether reassured, and kept\\r\\nturning round with a jump; the very shadows in the corner disquieted me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but I\\r\\ndid not see _him_; no, that was all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that\\r\\nthe specter is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to\\r\\nme again. And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not\\r\\nbelieve in it, and know that it is nothing?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt still worries me, however, because I am constantly thinking of it:\\r\\n_his right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man\\r\\nwho was asleep_.... Enough of that, in Heaven\\'s name! I don\\'t want to\\r\\nthink about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, however, am I so persistently possessed with this idea? His feet\\r\\nwere close to the fire!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe haunts me; it is very stupid, but so it is. Who and what is HE? I\\r\\nknow that he does not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my\\r\\nfears, and in my agony! There--enough of that!...\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, _to stiffen\\r\\nmyself_, so to say; but I cannot remain at home, because I know he is\\r\\nthere. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again;\\r\\nthat is all over. But he is there all the same in my thoughts. He\\r\\nremains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is\\r\\nbehind the doors, in the closed cupboards, in the wardrobe, under the\\r\\nbed, in every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take\\r\\nthe candle to look under the bed and throw a light on to the dark\\r\\nplaces, he is there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn\\r\\nround, certain that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him\\r\\nagain; but he is, for all that, none the less behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very stupid, it is dreadful; but what am I to do? I cannot help\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if there were two of us in the place, I feel certain that he would\\r\\nnot be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone; simply\\r\\nand solely because I am alone!',\n"," 'A PHILOSOPHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot had been my most intimate friend from childhood; we had no\\r\\nsecrets from each other, and were united heart and soul by a brotherly\\r\\nintimacy and a boundless confidence in each other, and I had been\\r\\nintrusted with the secret of all his love affairs, as he had been with\\r\\nmine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he told me that he was going to get married I was hurt, just as if\\r\\nhe had been guilty of a treacherous act with regard to me. I felt that\\r\\nit must interfere with that cordial and absolute affection which had\\r\\nunited us hitherto. His wife would come between us. The intimacy of the\\r\\nmarriage-bed establishes a kind of complicity of mysterious alliance\\r\\nbetween two persons, even when they have ceased to love each other. Man\\r\\nand wife are like two discreet partners who will not let anyone else\\r\\ninto their secrets. But that close bond which the conjugal kiss fastens\\r\\nis widely loosened on the day on which the woman takes a lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember Blérot\\'s wedding as if it were but yesterday. I would not be\\r\\npresent at the signing of the marriage contract, as I have no particular\\r\\nliking for such ceremonies, but I only went to the civil wedding and to\\r\\nthe church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife, whom I had never seen before, was a tall, slight girl, with\\r\\npale hair, pale cheeks, pale hands, and eyes to match. She walked with a\\r\\nslightly undulating motion, as if she were on board a ship, and seemed\\r\\nto advance with a succession of long, graceful curtsies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlérot seemed very much in love with her. He looked at her constantly,\\r\\nand I felt a shiver of an immoderate desire for her pass through my\\r\\nframe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to see him in a few days, and he said to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not know how happy I am; I am madly in love with her; but then\\r\\nshe is ... she is ...\" He did not finish his sentence, but he put the\\r\\ntips of his fingers to his lips with a gesture which signified:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Divine! delicious! perfect!\" and a good deal more besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked, laughing, \"What! all that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything that you can imagine,\" was his answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe introduced me to her. She was very pleasant, on easy terms with me,\\r\\nas was natural, and begged me to look upon their house as my own. I felt\\r\\nthat he, Blérot, did not belong to me any longer. Our intimacy was\\r\\naltogether checked, and we hardly found a word to say to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon took my leave, and shortly afterwards went to the East, and\\r\\nreturned by way of Russia, Germany, Sweden, and Holland, after an\\r\\nabsence of eighteen months from Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after my arrival, as I was walking along the boulevards to\\r\\nbreathe the air once more, I saw a pale man with sunken cheeks coming\\r\\ntowards me, who was as much like Blérot as it was possible for a\\r\\nphysically emaciated man to be to a strong, ruddy, rather stout man. I\\r\\nlooked at him in surprise, and asked myself: \"Can it possibly be he?\"\\r\\nBut he saw me, and came towards me with outstretched arms, and we\\r\\nembraced in the middle of the boulevard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had gone up and down once or twice from the Rue Druot to the\\r\\nVaudeville Theater, just as we were taking leave of each other--for he\\r\\nalready seemed quite done up with walking--I said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t look at all well. Are you ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do feel rather out of sorts,\" was all he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked like a man who was going to die, and I felt a flood of\\r\\naffection for my old friend, the only real one that I had ever had. I\\r\\nsqueezed his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you? Are you in pain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little tired; but it is nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does your doctor say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He calls it anæmia, and has ordered me to eat no white meat and to take\\r\\ntincture of iron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA suspicion flashed across me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you happy?\" I asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very happy; my wife is charming, and I love her more than ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I noticed that he grew rather red and seemed embarrassed, as if he\\r\\nwas afraid of any further questions, so I took him by the arm and pushed\\r\\nhim into a café, which was nearly empty at that time of day. I forced\\r\\nhim to sit down, and looking him straight in the face, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, old fellow, just tell me the exact truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing to tell you,\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not true,\" I replied firmly. \"You are ill, mentally perhaps,\\r\\nand you dare not reveal your secret to anyone. Something or other is\\r\\ndoing you harm, and I mean you to tell me what it is. Come, I am waiting\\r\\nfor you to begin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he got very red, stammered, and turning his head away, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very idiotic--but I--I am done for!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he did not go on, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I have got a wife who is killing me, that is all,\" he said\\r\\nabruptly, almost desperately.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not understand at first. \"Does she make you unhappy? How? What is\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he replied in a low voice, as if he were confessing some crime; \"I\\r\\nlove her too much, that is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thunderstruck at this brutal avowal, and then I felt inclined to\\r\\nlaugh, but at length I managed to reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, at least so it seems to me, you might manage to--to love\\r\\nher a little less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had got very pale again, and at length made up his mind to speak to\\r\\nme openly, as he used to do formerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"that is impossible; and I am dying from it I know; it is\\r\\nkilling me, and I am really frightened. Some days, like to-day, I feel\\r\\ninclined to leave her, to go away altogether, to start for the other end\\r\\nof the world, so as to live for a long time; and then, when the evening\\r\\ncomes, I return home in spite of myself, but slowly, and feeling\\r\\nuncomfortable. I go upstairs hesitatingly and ring, and when I go in I\\r\\nsee her there sitting in her easy chair, and she says, \\'How late you\\r\\nare,\\' I kiss her, and we sit down to dinner. During the meal I think to\\r\\nmyself: \\'I will go directly it is over, and take the train for\\r\\nsomewhere, no matter where;\\' but when we get back to the drawing-room I\\r\\nam so tired that I have not the courage to get up out of my chair, and\\r\\nso I remain, and then--and then--I succumb again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help smiling again. He saw it, and said: \"You may laugh, but\\r\\nI assure you it is very horrible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you tell your wife?\" I asked him. \"Unless she be a regular\\r\\nmonster she would understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"It is all very well for you to talk. I don\\'t\\r\\ntell her because I know her nature. Have you ever heard it said of\\r\\ncertain women, \\'She has just married a third time?\\' Well, and that makes\\r\\nyou laugh like you did just now, and yet it is true. What is to be done?\\r\\nIt is neither her fault nor mine. She is so, because nature has made her\\r\\nso; I assure you, my dear old friend, she has the temperament of a\\r\\nMessalina. She does not know it, but I do; so much the worse for me. She\\r\\nis charming, gentle, tender, and thinks that our conjugal intercourse,\\r\\nwhich is wearing me out and killing me, is natural and quite moderate.\\r\\nShe seems like an ignorant schoolgirl, and she really is ignorant, poor\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day I form energetic resolutions, for you must understand that I\\r\\nam dying. But one look of her eyes, one of those looks in which I can\\r\\nread the ardent desire of her lips, is enough for me, and I succumb at\\r\\nonce, saying to myself: \\'This is really the end; I will have no more of\\r\\nher death-giving kisses,\\' and then, when I have yielded again, like I\\r\\nhave to-day, I go out and walk on ahead, thinking of death, and saying\\r\\nto myself that I am lost, that all is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so mentally ill that I went for a walk to Père Lachaise cemetery\\r\\nyesterday. I looked at all the graves, standing in a row like dominoes,\\r\\nand I thought to myself: \\'I shall soon be there,\\' and then I returned\\r\\nhome, quite determined to pretend to be ill, and so escape, but I could\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! You don\\'t know what it is. Ask a smoker who is poisoning himself\\r\\nwith nicotine whether he can give up his delicious and deadly habit. He\\r\\nwill tell you that he has tried a hundred times without success, and he\\r\\nwill, perhaps, add: \\'So much the worse, but I had rather die than go\\r\\nwithout tobacco.\\' That is just the case with me. When once one is in the\\r\\nclutches of such a passion or such a vice, one must give oneself up to\\r\\nit entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and gave me his hand. I felt seized with a tumult of rage, and\\r\\nwith hatred for this woman, this careless, charming, terrible woman; and\\r\\nas he was buttoning up his coat to go out I said to him, brutally\\r\\nperhaps:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, in God\\'s name, why don\\'t you let her have a lover, rather than\\r\\nkill yourself like that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders without replying, and went off.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor six months I did not see him. Every morning I expected a letter of\\r\\ninvitation to his funeral, but I would not go to his house from a\\r\\ncomplicated feeling of contempt for him and for that woman; of anger, of\\r\\nindignation, of a thousand sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely spring morning I was walking in the Champs Elysées. It was\\r\\none of those warm days which makes our eyes bright and stir up in us a\\r\\ntumultuous feeling of happiness from the mere sense of existence.\\r\\nSomeone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I saw my old\\r\\nfriend, looking well, stout and rosy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me both hands, beaming with pleasure, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are, you erratic individual!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him, utterly thunderstruck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on my word--yes. By Jove! I congratulate you; you have indeed\\r\\nchanged in the last six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flushed scarlet, and said, with an embarrassed laugh:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One can but do one\\'s best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him so obstinately that he evidently felt uncomfortable, so\\r\\nI went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So--now--you are--completely cured?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stammered, hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, perfectly, thank you.\" Then changing his tone, \"How lucky that I\\r\\nshould have come across you, old fellow. I hope we shall often meet\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I would not give up my idea; I wanted to know how matters really\\r\\nstood, so I asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you remember what you told me six months ago? I\\r\\nsuppose--I--eh--suppose you resist now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t talk any more about it,\" he replied, uneasily; \"forget\\r\\nthat I mentioned it to you; leave me alone. But, you know, I have no\\r\\nintention of letting you go; you must come and dine at my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden fancy took me to see for myself how matters stood, so that I\\r\\nmight understand all about it, and I accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife received me in a most charming manner, and she was, as a matter\\r\\nof fact, a most attractive woman. Her long hands, her neck and cheeks\\r\\nwere beautifully white and delicate, and marked her breeding, and her\\r\\nwalk was undulating and delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené gave her a brotherly kiss on the forehead and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has not Lucien come yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" she replied, in a clear, soft voice; \"you know he is almost\\r\\nalways rather late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the bell rang, and a tall man was shown in. He was dark,\\r\\nwith a thick beard, and looked like a modern Hercules. We were\\r\\nintroduced to each other; his name was Lucien Delabarre.\\r\\n\\r\\nRené and he shook hands in a most friendly manner, and then we went to\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a most enjoyable meal, without the least constraint. My old\\r\\nfriend spoke with me constantly, in the old familiar cordial manner,\\r\\njust as he used to do. It was: \"You know, old fellow!\"--\"I say, old\\r\\nfellow!\"--\"Just listen a moment, old fellow!\" Suddenly he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know how glad I am to see you again; it takes me back to old\\r\\ntimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at his wife and the other man. Their attitude was perfectly\\r\\ncorrect, though I fancied once or twice that they exchanged a rapid and\\r\\nfurtive look.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as dinner was over René turned to his wife, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, I have just met Pierre again, and I am going to carry him off\\r\\nfor a walk and a chat along the boulevards to remind us of old times. I\\r\\nam leaving you in very good company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman smiled, and said to me, as she shook hands with me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep him too long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we went along, arm-in-arm, I could not help saying to him, for I was\\r\\ndetermined to know how matters stood:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, what has happened? Do tell me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, interrupted me roughly, and answered like a man who has\\r\\nbeen disturbed without any reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look here, old fellow leave one alone with your questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he added, half aloud, as if talking to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, it would have been too stupid to have let oneself go to pot\\r\\nlike that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not press him. We walked on quickly and began to talk. All of a\\r\\nsudden he whispered in my ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, suppose we go and have a bottle of \\'fizz\\' with some girls! Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not prevent myself from laughing heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you like; come along, let us go.\"',\n"," 'ALWAYS LOCK THE DOOR!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four glasses which were standing in front of the diners were now\\r\\nstill nearly half full, which is a sign, as a general rule, that the\\r\\nguests are quite so. They were beginning to speak without waiting for an\\r\\nanswer; no one took any notice of anything except what was going on\\r\\ninside him, either in his mind or stomach; voices grew louder, gestures\\r\\nmore animated, eyes brighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bachelors\\' dinner of confirmed old bachelors. They had\\r\\ninstituted this regular banquet twenty years before, christening it \"The\\r\\nCelibate,\" and at the time there were fourteen of them, all fully\\r\\ndetermined never to marry. Now there were only four of them left; three\\r\\nwere dead and the other seven were married.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four stuck firmly to it, and, as far as lay in their power, they\\r\\nscrupulously observed the rules which had been laid down at the\\r\\nbeginning of their curious association. They had sworn, hand-in-hand, to\\r\\nturn aside every woman they could from the right path, and their\\r\\nfriends\\' wives for choice, and more especially those of their most\\r\\nintimate friends. For this reason, as soon as any of them left the\\r\\nsociety, in order to set up in domestic life for himself, he took care\\r\\nto quarrel definitely with all his former companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this, they were pledged at every dinner to relate most minutely\\r\\ntheir last adventures, which had given rise to this familiar phrase\\r\\namongst them:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To lie like an old bachelor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey professed, moreover, the most profound contempt for woman whom they\\r\\ntalked of as an animal made solely for their pleasure. Every moment they\\r\\nquoted Schopenhauer, who was their god, and his well-known essay \"On\\r\\nWomen;\" they wished that harems and towers might be reintroduced, and\\r\\nhad the ancient maxim: \"Mulier, perpetuus infans,\"[10] woven into their\\r\\ntable-linen, and below it, the line of Alfred de Vigny\\'s:\\r\\n\\r\\n_La femme, enfant malade et douze fois impure._[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that by dint of despising women they lived only for them, while all\\r\\ntheir efforts and all their desires were directed towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of them who had married called them old fops, made fun of them,\\r\\nand--feared them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they began to feel the exhilarating effects of the champagne, this\\r\\nwas the moment that their old bachelor experiences began.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day in question, these old fellows, for they were old by this\\r\\ntime, and the older they got the more extraordinary _good fortune_ in\\r\\nthe way of love affairs they had to relate, were quite inexhaustible.\\r\\nFor the last month, to hear them, each of them had played the gallant\\r\\nwith at least one woman a day; and what women! the youngest, the\\r\\nnoblest, the richest, and the most beautiful!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had finished their tales, one of them, he who having spoken\\r\\nfirst had been obliged to listen to all the others, rose and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now that we have finished drawing the long-bow, I should like to tell\\r\\nyou, not my last, but my first adventure,--I mean the first adventure\\r\\nof my life, my first fall,--for it is a moral fall after all, in the\\r\\narms of Venus. Oh! I am not going to tell you my first--what shall I\\r\\ncall it?--my first appearance; certainly not. The leap over the first\\r\\nhedge (I am speaking figuratively) has nothing interesting about it. It\\r\\nis generally rather a disagreeable one, and one picks oneself up rather\\r\\nabashed, with one charming illusion the less, with a vague feeling of\\r\\ndisappointment and sadness. That _realization_ of love the first time\\r\\none experiences it is rather repugnant; we had dreamt of it as being so\\r\\ndifferent, so delicate, so refined. It leaves a physical and moral sense\\r\\nof disgust behind it, just like as when one has happened to have put\\r\\none\\'s hand into some clammy matter and feels in a hurry to _wash_ it\\r\\noff. You may _rub_ it as hard as you like, but the moral feeling\\r\\nremains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! but one very soon gets quite used to it; there is no doubt about\\r\\nthat. For my part, however, I am very sorry it was not in my power to\\r\\ngive the Creator the benefit of my advice when He was arranging these\\r\\nlittle matters. I wonder what _I_ should have done? I am not quite sure,\\r\\nbut I think with the English savant, John Stuart Mill, I should have\\r\\nmanaged differently; I should have found some more convenient and more\\r\\npoetical combination; yes--more poetical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really think that the Creator showed Himself to be too much of a\\r\\nnaturalist ... too ... what shall I say? His invention lacks poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, what I am going to tell you is about my first woman of the\\r\\nworld, the first woman in society I ever made love to;--I beg your\\r\\npardon, I ought to say the first woman of the world that ever triumphed\\r\\nover me. For at first it is _we_ who allow ourselves to be taken, while,\\r\\nlater on--well, then it is quite another matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was a friend of my mother\\'s, a charming woman in every way. When\\r\\nsuch women are chaste, it is generally from sheer stupidity, and when\\r\\nthey are in love they are furiously so. And then--_we_ are accused of\\r\\ncorrupting _them_! Yes, yes, of course! With them it is always the\\r\\nrabbit that begins and never the sportsman. I know all about it; they\\r\\ndon\\'t seem to put their fingers near us, but they do it all the same,\\r\\nand do what they like with us, without it being noticed, and then they\\r\\nactually accuse us of having ruined them, dishonored them, humiliated\\r\\nthem, and all the rest of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The woman in question certainly had a great desire to be humiliated by\\r\\nme. She may have been about thirty-five, while I was scarcely\\r\\ntwo-and-twenty. I no more thought of dishonoring her than I did of\\r\\nturning Trappist. Well, one day when I was calling on her, and while I\\r\\nwas looking at her dress with considerable astonishment, for she had on\\r\\na morning wrapper which was open as wide as a church-door when the bells\\r\\nare ringing for service, she took my hand and squeezed it--squeezed it,\\r\\nyou know, like they will do at such moments--and said, with a deep sigh,\\r\\none of those sighs, you know, which come from right down the bottom of\\r\\nthe chest: \\'Oh! don\\'t look at me like that, child!\\' I got as red as a\\r\\ntomato, and felt more nervous than usual, naturally. I was very much\\r\\ninclined to bolt, but she held my hand tightly, and putting it onto her\\r\\nwell-developed bust, she said: \\'Just feel how my heart beats!\\' Of course\\r\\nit was beating, and I began to understand what was the matter, but I\\r\\ndid not know what to do. I have changed considerably since then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I remained standing there, with one hand on the soft covering of her\\r\\nheart, while I held my hat in the other, and continuing to look at her\\r\\nwith a confused, silly smile--a timid, frightened smile--she suddenly\\r\\ndrew back, and said in an irritated voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Young man, what are you doing? You are indecent and badly brought up.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be sure I took my hand away quickly, stopped smiling, and\\r\\nstammering out some excuse, I got up and took my leave as if I had lost\\r\\nmy head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was caught, and dreamt of her. I thought her charming, adorable;\\r\\nI fancied that I loved her, that I had always loved her, and I\\r\\ndetermined to see her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I saw her again she gave me a little smile like an actress might\\r\\nbehind the scenes. Oh, how that little smile upset me! And she shook\\r\\nhands with a long, significant pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From that day it seems that I made love to her; at least, she declared\\r\\nafterwards that I had ruined her, captured her, dishonored her, with\\r\\nrare Machiavelism, with consummate cleverness, with the perseverance of\\r\\na mathematician, and the cunning of an Apaché Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But one thing troubled me strangely; where was my triumph to be\\r\\naccomplished? I lived with my family, and on this point my family was\\r\\nmost particular. I was not bold enough to venture to go to an hotel in\\r\\nbroad daylight with a woman on my arm, and I did not know whom to ask\\r\\nfor advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my fair friend had often said in joke that every young man ought\\r\\nto have a room for himself somewhere or other from home. We lived in\\r\\nParis, and this was a sort of inspiration. I took a room, and she came.\\r\\nShe came one day in November; I should have liked to put off her visit\\r\\nbecause I had no fire, and I had no fire because the chimney smoked. The\\r\\nvery evening before, I had spoken to my landlord, a retired shopkeeper,\\r\\nabout it, and he had promised that he would send for the chimneysweep in\\r\\na day or two to get it all put to rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as she came in, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There is no fire because my chimney smokes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not even appear to hear me, but stammered: \\'That does not\\r\\nmatter, I have...;\\' and when I looked surprised, she stopped short in\\r\\nconfusion, and then went on: \\'I don\\'t know what I am saying; I am\\r\\nmad.... I have lost my head.... Oh! what am I doing? Why did I come? How\\r\\nunhappy I am! What a disgrace, what a disgrace!\\' And she threw herself\\r\\nsobbing into my arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought that she really felt remorse, and swore that I would respect\\r\\nher. Then, however, she sank down at my knees, sighing: \\'But don\\'t you\\r\\nsee that I love you, that you have overcome me, that it seems as though\\r\\nyou had thrown a charm over me?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I thought it was about time to show myself a man. But she\\r\\ntrembled, got up, ran and hid behind a wardrobe, crying out: \\'Oh! don\\'t\\r\\nlook at me; no! no! If only you did not see me, if we were only in the\\r\\ndark! I am ashamed in the light. Cannot you imagine it? What a dreadful\\r\\ndream! Oh! this light, this light!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I rushed to the window; I closed the outside shutters, drew the\\r\\ncurtains, and hung a coat over a ray of light that peeped in, and then,\\r\\nstretching out my hands so as not to fall over the chairs, with my heart\\r\\nbeating, and felt for her, and found her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a fresh journey for the two of us then, groping our way, with\\r\\nour hands united, towards the other corner where the sofa stood. I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose we went straight, for first of all I knocked against the\\r\\nmantelpiece, and then against a chest of drawers, before finding what we\\r\\nwanted. After we sat down I forgot everything, and we almost went to\\r\\nsleep in each other\\'s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was half dreaming; but in my dream I fancied that someone was calling\\r\\nme and crying for help; then I received a violent blow, and opened my\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'O--h!\\' The setting sun, magnificent and red, shone full into the room\\r\\nthrough the door, which was wide open, and seemed to look at us from the\\r\\nverge of the horizon, illuminating us both, especially my companion, who\\r\\nwas screaming, struggling, and twisting, and trying with hands and feet\\r\\nto get under the sofa, while in the middle of the room stood my landlord\\r\\nby the side of the concierge[12] and a chimneysweep, as black as the\\r\\ndevil, who were looking at us with stupid eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood up in rage, ready to jump at his throat, and shouted:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What the deuce are you doing in my room?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimneysweep laughed so that he let his brush fall on the floor.\\r\\nThe porter looked as if he were going out of his mind, and the landlord\\r\\nstammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But, Monsieur, it was--it was--about the chimney--the chimney, the\\r\\nchimney which--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Go to the devil!\\' I roared. So he took off his hat, which he had kept\\r\\non in his confusion, and said, in a confused but very civil manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I beg your pardon, Monsieur; if I had known, I should not have\\r\\ndisturbed you; I should not have come. The concierge told me you had\\r\\ngone out. Pray excuse me.\\' And they all went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ever since that time I never draw the curtains but am always very\\r\\ncareful to lock the door first.\"',\n"," 'A MEETING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all an accident, a pure accident. Tired of standing, Baron\\r\\nd\\'Etraille went, as all the Princess\\'s rooms were open on that\\r\\nparticular evening, into an empty bedroom, which appeared almost dark\\r\\nafter coming out of the brilliantly lighted drawing-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his\\r\\nwife would not go away before daylight. As soon as he got inside the\\r\\ndoor he saw the big bed with its azure-and-gold hangings, in the middle\\r\\nof the great room, looking like a catafalque in which love was buried,\\r\\nfor the Princess was no longer young. Behind it, a large bright spot\\r\\nlooked like a lake seen at a distance from the window. It was a large\\r\\nlooking-glass, which, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that,\\r\\nhowever, was very rarely let down, seemed to look at the bed, which was\\r\\nits accomplice. One might almost fancy that it felt regrets, and that\\r\\none was going to see in it charming shapes of naked women, and the\\r\\ngentle movement of arms about to embrace them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron stood still for a moment, smiling, rather moved, on the\\r\\nthreshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly something\\r\\nappeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had evoked\\r\\nhad risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on a low\\r\\ncouch hidden in the shade had got up, and the polished surface,\\r\\nreflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other\\r\\nbefore separating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigné. He turned and\\r\\nwent away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited till it\\r\\nwas day before taking away the Baroness; but he had no longer any\\r\\nthoughts of sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they were alone he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame, I saw you just now in Princess de Raynes\\' room; I need say no\\r\\nmore, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of\\r\\nridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without\\r\\nany scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my\\r\\norders. You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer\\r\\nunder my roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn\\r\\nyou that, should any scandal arise, I shall show myself inflexible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to speak, but he stopped her, bowed, and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly\\r\\nduring the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,\\r\\nand now he often had a caprice, either in a theater or in society,\\r\\nthough he always preserved a certain liking for the Baroness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight--too\\r\\nslight--and very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoilt,\\r\\nelegant, coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to\\r\\nsay familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My wife is charming, attractive, but--there is nothing to lay hold of.\\r\\nShe is like a glass of champagne that is all froth--when you have got to\\r\\nthe wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked up and down the room in great agitation, and thinking of a\\r\\nthousand things. At one moment he felt in a great rage, and felt\\r\\ninclined to give the Marquis a good thrashing or to smack his face\\r\\npublicly, in the club. But he thought that would not do, it would not be\\r\\nat all _the thing_; he would be laughed at, and not the Marquis, and as\\r\\nhe felt that his anger proceeded more from wounded vanity than from a\\r\\nbroken heart he went to bed, but could not go to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days afterwards it was known in Paris that the Baron and Baroness\\r\\nd\\'Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of\\r\\nincompatibility of temper. Nobody suspected anything, nobody laughed,\\r\\nand nobody was astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron, however, to avoid meeting her, traveled for a year, then he\\r\\nspent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning\\r\\nto Paris for the winter. He did not meet his wife once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not even know what people said about her. At any rate, she took\\r\\ncare to save appearances, and that was all he asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got dreadfully bored, traveled again, restored his old castle of\\r\\nVillebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he received\\r\\nrelays of friends there, till at last, tired of all these commonplace,\\r\\nso-called pleasures, he returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lills,\\r\\njust six years after their separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was then forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and\\r\\nwith that melancholy look of people who have been handsome, sought\\r\\nafter, and much liked, and who are deteriorating daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month after his return to Paris he took cold on coming out of his\\r\\nclub, and had a bad cough, so his medical man ordered him to Nice for\\r\\nthe rest of the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started by the express on Monday evening. He was late, and got to the\\r\\nstation only a very short time before the departure of the train, and\\r\\nhad barely time to get into a carriage, with only one occupant, who was\\r\\nsitting in a corner so wrapped in furs and cloaks that he could not even\\r\\nmake out whether it were a man or a woman, as nothing of the figure\\r\\ncould be seen. When he perceived that he could not find out, he put on\\r\\nhis traveling-cap, rolled himself up in his rugs, and stretched himself\\r\\nout comfortably to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not wake up till the day was breaking, and looked immediately at\\r\\nhis fellow-traveler. He had not stirred all night, and seemed still to\\r\\nbe sound asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. d\\'Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his\\r\\nbeard, and to try and freshen himself up a little generally, for a\\r\\nnight\\'s traveling changes one\\'s looks very much when one has attained to\\r\\na certain age.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great poet has said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"When we are young, our mornings are triumphant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we wake up with a cool skin, a bright eye, and glossy hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one grows older one wakes up in a very different state. Dull eyes,\\r\\nred, swollen cheeks, dry lips, the hair and beard all disarranged,\\r\\nimpart an old, fatigued, wornout look to the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron opened his traveling dressing-case, and made himself as tidy\\r\\nas he could, and then he waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engine whistled and the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No\\r\\ndoubt he was awake. They started off again, and then an oblique ray of\\r\\nsun shone into the carriage just on to the sleeper, who moved again,\\r\\nshook himself, and then calmly showed his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a young, fair, pretty, stout woman, and the Baron looked at her\\r\\nin amazement. He did not know what to believe. He could really have\\r\\nsworn that it was--his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better:\\r\\nstouter--why she had grown as stout as he was--only it suited her much\\r\\nbetter than it did him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him quietly, did not seem to recognize him, and then\\r\\nslowly laid aside her wraps. She had that calm assurance of a woman who\\r\\nis sure of herself, the insolent audacity of a first awakening, knowing\\r\\nand feeling that she was in her full beauty and freshness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron really lost his head. Was it his wife, or somebody else who\\r\\nwas as like her as any sister could be? As he had not seen her for six\\r\\nyears he might be mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe yawned, and he knew her by her gesture, and she turned and looked at\\r\\nhim again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then\\r\\nlooked out at the country again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was upset and dreadfully perplexed, and waited, looking at her\\r\\nsideways, steadfastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; it was certainly his wife. How could he possibly have doubted?\\r\\nThere could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand\\r\\nrecollections flashed through him, slight details of her body, a\\r\\nbeauty-spot on one of her thighs, and another opposite to it on her\\r\\nback. How often he had kissed them! He felt the old feeling of the\\r\\nintoxication of love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet\\r\\nodor of her skin, her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders,\\r\\nthe soft intonations of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. He\\r\\nthought her riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more\\r\\ndesirable, adorably desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a\\r\\nrailway-carriage belonged to him; he had only to say to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I insist upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he\\r\\nhad found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.\\r\\nIt was another, and yet she at the same time. It was another who had\\r\\nbeen born, and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she,\\r\\nindeed; she whom he had possessed but who was now altered, with a more\\r\\nassured smile and greater self-possession. There were two women in one,\\r\\nmingling a great past of what was new and unknown with many sweet\\r\\nrecollections of the past. There was something singular, disturbing,\\r\\nexciting about it--a kind of mystery of love in which there floated a\\r\\ndelicious confusion. It was his wife in a new body and in new flesh\\r\\nwhich lips had never pressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he thought that in six years everything changes in us, only the\\r\\noutline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood, the hair, the skin all change, and is reconstituted, and when\\r\\npeople have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they\\r\\nfind another totally different being, although it be the same and bear\\r\\nthe same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so\\r\\nthat in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant\\r\\ntransformations, become four or five totally new and different beings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken\\r\\npossession of him when he surprised her in the Princess\\'s room. He was\\r\\nnot the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking\\r\\nat--that thin, excitable little doll of those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to\\r\\nher? Had she recognized him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: \"Bertha, do you\\r\\nwant anything I could bring you?...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the\\r\\nslightest surprise or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect\\r\\nindifference:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not want anything,--thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to\\r\\nrecover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall.\\r\\nWhat should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as\\r\\nif he were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would\\r\\nlook as if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were\\r\\nher master? He would look like a fool, and besides, he really had no\\r\\nright to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got in again and took his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was\\r\\nnow lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to her, and said: \"My dear Bertha, since this singular chance\\r\\nhas brought us together after a separation of six years--a quite\\r\\nfriendly separation--are we to continue to look upon each other as\\r\\nirreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, _tête-à-tête_, which is\\r\\nso much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into\\r\\nanother carriage, so don\\'t you think it is preferable to talk as friends\\r\\ntill the end of our journey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered quite calmly again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had\\r\\nplenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle-seat, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,\\r\\nhowever, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how\\r\\nyou have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who\\r\\ncould give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now\\r\\nwhen you emerged from your wraps. I could really have thought such a\\r\\nchange impossible....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout moving her head or looking at him, she said: \"I cannot say the\\r\\nsame with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got red and confused, and then, with a smile of resignation, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" was her reply. \"I am only stating facts. I don\\'t suppose you\\r\\nintend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter of perfect\\r\\nindifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a painful\\r\\nsubject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been doing\\r\\nsince I last saw you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt rather out of countenance, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I? I have traveled, shot, and grown old, as you see. And you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said, quite calmly: \"I have taken care of appearances, as you\\r\\nordered me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very near saying something brutal, but he checked himself, and\\r\\nkissed his wife\\'s hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I thank you,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised. He was indeed cool and always master of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on: \"As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now talk\\r\\nwithout any bitterness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made a little movement of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bitterness? I don\\'t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I am\\r\\nonly trying to keep up a difficult conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still looking at her, carried away in spite of her harshness, and\\r\\nhe felt seized with a brutal desire, the desire of the master.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerceiving that she had hurt his feelings, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old are you now? I thought you were younger than you look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grew rather pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am forty-five;\" and then he added: \"I forgot to ask after Princess de\\r\\nRaynes. Are you still intimate with her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him as if she hated him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I certainly am. She is very well, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey remained sitting side-by-side, agitated and irritated. Suddenly he\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I expect\\r\\nyou to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both morally and\\r\\nphysically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your husband,\\r\\nand it is my right to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but\\r\\nhis face was resolute and impenetrable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" she said, \"but I have made other engagements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse for you,\" was his reply. \"The law gives me the power,\\r\\nand I mean to use it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were getting to Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened\\r\\nspeed. The Baroness got up, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then\\r\\nturning to her husband, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of the _tête-à-tête_ which I had\\r\\ncarefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your\\r\\nadvice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other\\r\\npeople, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall go wherever you go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me in\\r\\npeace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the\\r\\nPrincess de Raynes and Countess Hermit waiting for me with their\\r\\nhusbands. I wished them to see us, and to know that we had spent the\\r\\nnight together in the railway-carriage. Don\\'t be alarmed; they will tell\\r\\nit everywhere as a most surprising fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice and\\r\\nsaved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in\\r\\norder to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to\\r\\navoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid--I am\\r\\nafraid--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up\\r\\nto open the carriage-door, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that I am in the family-way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess stretched out her arms to embrace her, and the Baroness\\r\\nsaid, pointing to the Baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was\\r\\ntrying to get at the truth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal, and\\r\\nhe agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take\\r\\nlittle trips like this, occasionally, like good friends who cannot live\\r\\ntogether. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped\\r\\nout on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baron hastily shut the carriage-door, for he was too much disturbed\\r\\nto say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife\\'s voice,\\r\\nand their merry laughter as they went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told\\r\\nhim a lie or was speaking the truth.',\n"," 'THE LITTLE CASK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJules Chicot, the innkeeper, who lived at Épreville, pulled up his\\r\\ntilbury in front of Mother Magloire\\'s farmhouse. He was a tall man of\\r\\nabout forty, with a red face and a round stomach, and was generally said\\r\\nto be _a very knowing customer_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hitched his horse up to the gatepost and went in. He owned some land\\r\\nadjoining that of the old woman\\'s, which he had been coveting for a long\\r\\nwhile, and had tried in vain to buy a score of times, but she had always\\r\\nobstinately refused to part with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was born here, and here I mean to die,\" was all she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door. She was a\\r\\nwoman of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost\\r\\ndried up in fact, and much bent, but as active and untiring as a girl.\\r\\nChicot patted her on the back in a very friendly fashion, and then sat\\r\\ndown by her on a stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Mother, you are always pretty well and hearty, I am glad to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to complain of, considering, thank you. And how are you, Mons.\\r\\nChicot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains occasionally;\\r\\notherwise, I should have nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all the better!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work.\\r\\nHer crooked, knotty fingers, hard as a lobster\\'s claws, seized the\\r\\ntubers, which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of\\r\\npincers, and she peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin\\r\\nwith an old knife which she held in the other hand, throwing the\\r\\npotatoes into the water as they were done. Three daring fowls jumped one\\r\\nafter the other into her lap, seized a bit of peel, and then ran away as\\r\\nfast as their legs would carry them with it in their beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his\\r\\ntongue which he could not get out. At last he said hurriedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Mother Magloire--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your farm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not; you may make up your mind to that. What I have said, I\\r\\nhave said, so don\\'t refer to it again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well; only I fancy I have thought of an arrangement that might\\r\\nsuit us both very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are. You shall sell it to me, and keep it all the same. You\\r\\ndon\\'t understand? Very well, so just follow me in what I am going to\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman left off peeling her potatoes, and looked at the innkeeper\\r\\nattentively from under her bushy eyebrows, and he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me explain myself. Every month I will give you one hundred and\\r\\nfifty francs. You understand me, I suppose? Every month I will come and\\r\\nbring you thirty crowns[13] and it will not make the slightest\\r\\ndifference in your life--not the very slightest. You will have your own\\r\\nhome just as you have now, will not trouble yourself about me, and will\\r\\nowe me nothing; all you will have to do will be to take my money. Will\\r\\nthat arrangement suit you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said\\r\\nbenevolently, and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if\\r\\nshe suspected a trap, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems all right, as far as I am concerned, but it will not give you\\r\\nthe farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind about that,\" he said, \"you will remain here as long as it\\r\\npleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home. Only you\\r\\nwill sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me after your death.\\r\\nYou have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don\\'t care a\\r\\nstraw. Will that suit you? You will keep everything during your life,\\r\\nand I will give you the thirty crowns a month. It is pure gain as far as\\r\\nyou are concerned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but nevertheless, very much\\r\\ntempted to agree, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.\\r\\nCome back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then\\r\\ngive you my definite answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Chicot went off, as happy as a king who has conquered an empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in\\r\\nfact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation. She _smelt_, so to\\r\\nsay, that there was something underneath the offer which was not to her\\r\\nadvantage; but then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those\\r\\ncoins chinking in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies,\\r\\nwithout her doing anything for it, filled her with covetousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the notary, and told him about it. He advised her to accept\\r\\nChicot\\'s offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty\\r\\ninstead of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the\\r\\nlowest calculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you live for fifteen years longer,\" he said, \"even then he will only\\r\\nhave paid forty-five thousand francs for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns\\r\\na month; but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she\\r\\nremained a long time with the lawyer, asking questions without being\\r\\nable to make up her mind to go. At last she gave him instructions to\\r\\ndraw up the deed, and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if\\r\\nshe had drunk four jugs of new cider.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Chicot came again to receive her answer she took a lot of\\r\\npersuading, and declared that she could not make up her mind to agree to\\r\\nhis proposal, though she was all the time on tenter-hooks lest he should\\r\\nnot consent to give the fifty crowns: but at last, when he grew urgent,\\r\\nshe told him what she expected for her farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised and disappointed, and refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in order to convince him, she began to talk about the probable\\r\\nduration of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly not likely to live for more than five or six years\\r\\nlonger. I am nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering\\r\\nmy age. The other evening I thought I was going to die, and could\\r\\nhardly manage to crawl into bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Chicot was not going to be taken in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and will\\r\\nlive till you are a hundred at least; you will be sure to see me put\\r\\nunderground first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman\\r\\nwould not give way, the landlord consented to give the fifty crowns, and\\r\\nshe insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years passed by, and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day\\r\\nolder. Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been\\r\\npaying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done,\\r\\nthat he was ruined. From time to time he went to see his annuitant, just\\r\\nas one goes in July to see when the harvest is likely to begin. She\\r\\nalways met him with a cunning look, and one would have felt inclined to\\r\\nthink that she was congratulating herself on the trick she had played\\r\\nhim. Seeing how well and hearty she seemed, he very soon got into his\\r\\ntilbury again, growling to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you never die, you old brute?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he\\r\\nsaw her. He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a\\r\\npeasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for means of\\r\\ngetting rid of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands like he did the\\r\\nfirst time when he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a\\r\\nfew minutes, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you are\\r\\nin Épreville? The people are talking about it, and saying that we are\\r\\nnot on friendly terms, and that pains me. You know it will cost you\\r\\nnothing if you come, for I don\\'t look at the price of a dinner. Come\\r\\nwhenever you feel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Mother Magloire did not need to be told twice, and the next day but\\r\\none, as she was going to town in any case, it being market-day, in her\\r\\ngig, driven by her man, she, without any demur, put her trap up in\\r\\nChicot\\'s stable, and went in search of her promised dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe publican was delighted, and treated her like a lady, giving her\\r\\nroast fowl, blackpudding, leg of mutton, and bacon and cabbage. But she\\r\\nate next to nothing. She had always been a small eater, and had\\r\\ngenerally lived on a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot was disappointed, and pressed her to eat more, but she refused,\\r\\nand she would drink next to nothing either, and declined any coffee, so\\r\\nhe asked her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as to that, I don\\'t know that I will refuse.\" Whereupon he\\r\\nshouted out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosalie, bring the superfine brandy,--_the special_,--you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper\\r\\nvine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just try that; you will find it first-rate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last\\r\\nall the longer, and when she had finished her glass, draining the last\\r\\ndrops so as to make the pleasure last all the longer, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that is first-rate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost before she had said it, Chicot had poured her out another\\r\\nglassful. She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it\\r\\nvery slowly, like she had done the first, and he asked her to have a\\r\\nthird. She objected, but he persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen without any\\r\\nill effects; it goes down like sugar, and leaves no signs in the head,\\r\\none would think that it evaporated on the tongue. It is the most\\r\\nwholesome thing you can drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, for she really wished to have it, but she left half the\\r\\nglass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chicot, in an excess of generosity, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small keg\\r\\nof it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends.\" So she\\r\\ntook one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of what\\r\\nshe had drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the innkeeper drove into her yard, and took a little\\r\\niron-hooped keg out of his gig. He insisted on her tasting the contents,\\r\\nto make sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each\\r\\nof them drunk three more glasses, he said, as he was going away:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know, when it is all gone, there is more left; don\\'t be\\r\\nmodest, for I shall not mind. The sooner it is finished, the better\\r\\npleased I shall be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days later he came again. The old woman was outside her door\\r\\ncutting up the bread for her soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went up to her, and put his face close to hers, so that he might\\r\\nsmell her breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you will give me a glass of _the special_?\" he said. And they\\r\\nhad three glasses each.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was\\r\\nin the habit of getting drunk all by herself. She was picked up in her\\r\\nkitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and\\r\\nshe was often brought home like a log.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicot did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to him about\\r\\nher, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age; but\\r\\nwhen people get old there is no remedy. It will be the death of her in\\r\\nthe long run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it certainly was the death of her. She died the next winter. About\\r\\nChristmas-time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found\\r\\ndead the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Chicot came in for the farm he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very stupid of her; if she had not taken to drink she might very\\r\\nwell have lived for ten years longer.\"',\n"," 'HOW HE GOT THE LEGION OF HONOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people are born with a predominant instinct, with some vocation or\\r\\nsome desire which has been evoked as soon as they begin to speak or to\\r\\nthink.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since he was a child M. Caillard had only had one idea in his\\r\\nhead--to be decorated. When he was still quite a small boy he used to\\r\\nwear a zinc Cross of the Legion of Honor in his tunic, just like other\\r\\nchildren wear a soldier\\'s cap, and he took his mother\\'s hand in the\\r\\nstreet with a proud look, sticking out his little chest with its red\\r\\nribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis studies were not a success, and he failed in his Examination for\\r\\nBachelor of Arts; so, not knowing what to do, he married a pretty girl,\\r\\nas he had plenty of money of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived in Paris, like many rich middle-class people do, mixing with\\r\\ntheir own particular set, without going among other people, and proud of\\r\\nknowing a Deputy, who might perhaps be a Minister some day, while two\\r\\nChiefs of Division were among their friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mons. Caillard could not get rid of his one absorbing idea, and he\\r\\nfelt constantly unhappy because he had not the right to wear a little\\r\\nbit of colored ribbon in his buttonhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he met any men who were decorated, on the boulevards, he looked at\\r\\nthem askance, with intense jealousy. Sometimes, when he had nothing to\\r\\ndo in the afternoon, he would count them, and say to himself: \"Just let\\r\\nme see how many I shall meet between the Madeleine and the Rue Druot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye\\r\\nfor the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his\\r\\nwalk he always said the numbers out aloud. \"Eight officers and seventeen\\r\\nknights. As many as that! It is stupid to sow the Cross broadcast in\\r\\nthat fashion. I wonder how many I shall meet going back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he returned slowly, unhappy when the crowd of passers-by interfered\\r\\nwith his seeing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew the places where most were to be found. They swarmed in the\\r\\nPalais Royal. Fewer were seen in the Avenue de l\\'Opera than in the Rue\\r\\nde la Paix, while the right side of the boulevard was more frequented by\\r\\nthem than the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also seemed to prefer certain cafés and theaters. Whenever he saw a\\r\\ngroup of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of\\r\\nthe pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:\\r\\n\"They are officers of the Legion of Honor,\" and he felt inclined to take\\r\\noff his hat to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had often remarked that the officers had a different bearing to the\\r\\nmere knights. They carried their head differently, and one felt that\\r\\nthey enjoyed a higher official consideration, and a more widely-extended\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes again the worthy man would be seized with a furious hatred for\\r\\neveryone who was decorated; he felt like a Socialist towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when he got home, excited at meeting so many Crosses--just like a\\r\\npoor hungry wretch is on passing some dainty provision shop--he used to\\r\\nask in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When shall we get rid of this wretched Government?\" And his wife would\\r\\nbe surprised, and ask:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am indignant,\" he replied, \"at the injustice I see going on around\\r\\nus. Oh! the Communards were certainly right!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner he would go out again and look at the shops where all the\\r\\ndecorations were sold, and he examined all the emblems of various shapes\\r\\nand colors. He would have liked to possess them all, and to have walked\\r\\ngravely at the head of a procession with his crush-hat under his arm and\\r\\nhis breast covered with decorations, radiant as a star, amid a buzz of\\r\\nadmiring whispers and a hum of respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! he had no right to wear any decoration whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used to say to himself: \"It is really too difficult for any man to\\r\\nobtain the Legion of Honor unless he is some public functionary. Suppose\\r\\nI try to get appointed an officer of the Academy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did not know how to set about it, and spoke to his wife on the\\r\\nsubject, who was stupefied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Officer of the Academy! What have you done to deserve it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got angry. \"I know what I am talking about; I only want to know how\\r\\nto set about it. You are quite stupid at times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled. \"You are quite right; I don\\'t understand anything about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn idea struck him: \"Suppose you were to speak to M. Rosselin, the\\r\\nDeputy, he might be able to advise me. You understand I cannot broach\\r\\nthe subject to him directly. It is rather difficult and delicate, but\\r\\ncoming from you it might seem quite natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Caillard did what he asked her, and M. Rosselin promised to speak\\r\\nto the Minister about it, and then Caillard began to worry him, till the\\r\\nDeputy told him he must make a formal application and put forward his\\r\\nclaims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What were his claims?\" he said. \"He was not even a Bachelor of Arts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he set to work and produced a pamphlet, with the title, \"The\\r\\nPeople\\'s Right to Instruction,\" but he could not finish it for want of\\r\\nideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The\\r\\nfirst was, \"The Instruction of Children by means of the Eye.\" He wanted\\r\\ngratuitous theaters to be established in every poor quarter of Paris for\\r\\nlittle children. Their parents were to take them there when they were\\r\\nquite young, and, by means of a magic-lantern, all the notions of human\\r\\nknowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular courses.\\r\\nThe sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain\\r\\nimpressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made\\r\\nvisible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history,\\r\\nnatural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, &c., &c., thus?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his ideas printed in tract form, and sent a copy to each Deputy,\\r\\nten to each Minister, fifty to the President of the Republic, ten to\\r\\neach Parisian and five to each provincial newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he wrote on \"Street Lending-Libraries.\" His idea was to have\\r\\nlittle carts full of books drawn about the streets, like orange-carts\\r\\nare. Every householder or lodger would have a right to ten volumes a\\r\\nmonth by means of a halfpenny subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The people,\" M. Caillard said, \"will only disturb itself for the sake\\r\\nof its pleasures, and since it will not go to instruction, instruction\\r\\nmust come to it,\" &c., &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis essays attracted no attention, but he sent in his application, and\\r\\nhe got the usual formal official reply. He thought himself sure of\\r\\nsuccess, but nothing came of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made up his mind to apply personally. He begged for an interview\\r\\nwith the Minister of Public Instruction, and he was received by a young\\r\\nsubordinate, who already was very grave and important, and who kept\\r\\ntouching the knobs of electric-bells to summon ushers, and footmen, and\\r\\nofficials inferior to himself. He declared to M. Caillard that his\\r\\nmatter was going on quite favorably, and advised him to continue his\\r\\nremarkable labors, and M. Caillard set at it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Rosselin, the Deputy, seemed now to take a great interest in his\\r\\nsuccess, and gave him a lot of excellent, practical advice. He was\\r\\ndecorated, although nobody knew exactly what he had done to deserve such\\r\\na distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told Caillard what new studies he ought to undertake; he introduced\\r\\nhim to learned Societies which took up particularly obscure points of\\r\\nscience, in the hope of gaining credit and honors thereby; and he even\\r\\ntook him under his wing at the Ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when he came to lunch with his friend (for several months past\\r\\nhe had constantly taken his meals there), he said to him in a whisper as\\r\\nhe shook hands: \"I have just obtained a great favor for you. The\\r\\nCommittee of Historical Works is going to intrust you with a commission.\\r\\nThere are some researches to be made in various libraries in France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaillard was so delighted that he could scarcely eat or drink, and a\\r\\nweek later he set out. He went from town to town, studying catalogues,\\r\\nrummaging in lofts full of dusty volumes, and was hated by all the\\r\\nlibrarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, happening to be at Rouen, he thought he should like to go and\\r\\nembrace his wife, whom he had not seen for more than a week, so he took\\r\\nthe nine o\\'clock train, which would land him at home by twelve at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his latchkey, so he went in without making any noise, delighted\\r\\nat the idea of the surprise he was going to give her. She had locked\\r\\nherself in. How tiresome! However, he cried out through the door:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jeanne, it is I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must have been very frightened, for he heard her jump out of bed and\\r\\nspeak to herself, as if she were in a dream. Then she went to her\\r\\ndressing-room, opened and closed the door, and went quickly up and down\\r\\nher room barefoot two or three times, shaking the furniture till the\\r\\nvases and glasses sounded. Then at last she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it you, Alexander?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he replied; \"make haste and open the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had done so, she threw herself into his arms, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! what a fright!... What a surprise!... What a pleasure!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to undress himself methodically, like he did everything, and\\r\\nfrom a chair he took his overcoat, which he was in the habit of hanging\\r\\nup in the hall. But, suddenly, he remained motionless, struck dumb with\\r\\nastonishment--there was a red ribbon in the buttonhole!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" he stammered, \"this--this--this--this overcoat has got the\\r\\nrosette in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a second his wife threw herself on him, and taking it from his hands,\\r\\nshe said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! you have made a mistake--give it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he still held it by one of the sleeves, without letting it go,\\r\\nrepeating, in a half-dazed manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Why? Just explain ... whose overcoat is it? It is not mine, as it\\r\\nhas the Legion of Honor on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to take it from him, terrified, and hardly able to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen ... listen ... give it me ... I must not tell you ... it is a\\r\\nsecret ... listen to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he grew angry, and turned pale:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know how this overcoat comes to be here? It does not belong\\r\\nto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she almost screamed at him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes it does; listen ... swear to me ... well ... you are decorated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not intend to joke at his expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so overcome that he let the overcoat fall, and dropped into an\\r\\narmchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am ... you say I am ... decorated?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but it is a secret, a great secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had put the glorious garment into a cupboard, and came to her\\r\\nhusband pale and trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she continued, \"it is a new overcoat that I have had made for\\r\\nyou. But I swore that I would not tell you anything about it, as it will\\r\\nnot be officially announced for a month or six weeks, and you were not\\r\\nto have known till your return from your business journey. M. Rosselin\\r\\nmanaged it for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin!\" he contrived to utter in his joy; \"he has obtained the\\r\\ndecoration for me? He--Oh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he was obliged to drink a glass of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the\\r\\novercoat. Caillard picked it up; it was a visiting-card, and he read\\r\\nout:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rosselin--Deputy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see how it is,\" said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe almost cried with joy, and, a week later, it was announced in the\\r\\n_Journal Officiel_ that M. Caillard had been awarded the Legion of Honor\\r\\non account of his exceptional services.',\n"," 'THE ACCURSED BREAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDaddy Taille had three daughters: Anna, the eldest, who was scarcely\\r\\never mentioned in the family; Rose, the second girl, who was eighteen;\\r\\nand Clara, the youngest, who was a girl of fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Taille was a widower, and a foreman in M. Lebrument\\'s\\r\\nbutton-manufactory. He was a very upright man, very well thought of,\\r\\nabstemious; in fact a sort of model workman. He lived at Havre, in the\\r\\nRue d\\'Angoulême.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Anna ran away the old man flew into a fearful rage. He threatened\\r\\nto kill the seducer, who was head clerk in a large draper\\'s\\r\\nestablishment in that town. Then, when he was told by various people\\r\\nthat she was keeping very steady and investing money in Government\\r\\nsecurities, that she was no gadabout, but was kept by a Mons. Dubois,\\r\\nwho was a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, the father was appeased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe even showed some anxiety as to how she was getting on, asked some of\\r\\nher old friends who had been to see her how she was getting on; and when\\r\\ntold that she had her own furniture, and that her mantelpiece was\\r\\ncovered with vases and the walls with pictures, that there were clocks\\r\\nand carpets everywhere, he gave a broad, contented smile. He had been\\r\\nworking for thirty years to get together a wretched five or six thousand\\r\\nfrancs. This girl was evidently no fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning the son of Touchard, the cooper, at the other end of\\r\\nthe street, came and asked him for the hand of Rose, the second girl.\\r\\nThe old man\\'s heart began to beat, for the Touchards were rich and in a\\r\\ngood position. He was decidedly lucky with his girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage was agreed upon, and it was settled that it should be a\\r\\ngrand affair, and the wedding dinner was to be held at Sainte-Adresse,\\r\\nat Mother Lusa\\'s restaurant. It would cost a lot certainly; but never\\r\\nmind, it did not matter just for once in a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one morning, just as the old man was going home to breakfast with\\r\\nhis two daughters the door opened suddenly, and Anna appeared. She was\\r\\nelegantly dressed, wore rings and an expensive bonnet, and looked\\r\\nundeniably pretty and nice. She threw her arms round her father\\'s neck\\r\\nbefore he could say a word, then fell into her sister\\'s arms with many\\r\\ntears, and then asked for a plate, so that she might share the family\\r\\nsoup. Taille was moved to tears in his turn and said several times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right, dear; that is right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told them about herself. She did not wish Rose\\'s wedding to\\r\\ntake place at Sainte-Adresse,--certainly not. It should take place at\\r\\nher house, and would cost her father nothing. She had settled everything\\r\\nand arranged everything, so it was \"no good to say any more about\\r\\nit,--there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, my dear! very well!\" the old man said, \"we will leave it\\r\\nso.\" But then he felt some doubt. Would the Touchards consent? But Rose,\\r\\nthe bride-elect, was surprised and asked, \"Why should they object, I\\r\\nshould like to know? Just leave that to me, I will talk to Philip about\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mentioned it to her lover the very same day, and he declared that\\r\\nit would suit him exactly. Father and Mother Touchard were naturally\\r\\ndelighted at the idea of a good dinner which would cost them nothing,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be quite sure that everything will be in first-rate style, as\\r\\nM. Dubois is made of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey asked to be allowed to bring a friend, Mme. Florence, the cook on\\r\\nthe first floor, and Anna agreed to everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was fixed for the last Tuesday of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the civil formalities and the religious ceremony the wedding party\\r\\nwent to Anna\\'s house. Among those whom the Tailles had brought was a\\r\\ncousin of a certain age, a M. Sauvetanin, a man given to philosophical\\r\\nreflections, serious, and always very self-possessed, and Mme.\\r\\nLamonoois, an old aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Sauvetanin had been told off to give Anna his arm, as they were\\r\\nlooked upon as the two most important persons in the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they had arrived at the door of Anna\\'s house she let go her\\r\\ncompanion\\'s arm, and ran on ahead, saying, \"I will show you the way,\"\\r\\nand ran upstairs while the invited guests followed more slowly; and,\\r\\nwhen they got upstairs, she stood on one side to let them pass, and they\\r\\nrolled their eyes and turned their heads in all directions to admire\\r\\nthis mysterious and luxurious dwelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was laid in the drawing-room as the dining-room had been\\r\\nthought too small. Extra knives, forks, and spoons had been hired from\\r\\na neighboring restaurant, and decanters full of wine under the rays of\\r\\nthe sun which shown in through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies went into the bedroom to take off their shawls and bonnets,\\r\\nand Father Touchard, who was standing at the door, squinted at the low\\r\\nwide bed, and made funny and suggestive signs to the men, with many a\\r\\nwink and a nod. Daddy Taille, who thought a great deal of himself,\\r\\nlooked with fatherly pride at his child\\'s well-furnished rooms, and went\\r\\nfrom one to the other holding his hat in his hand, making a mental\\r\\ninventory of everything, and walking like a verger in a church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna went backwards and forwards, ran about giving orders and hurrying\\r\\non the wedding feast. Soon she appeared at the door of the dining-room,\\r\\nand cried: \"Come here, all of you, for a moment,\" and when the twelve\\r\\nguests did as they were asked they saw twelve glasses of Madeira on a\\r\\nsmall table.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose and her husband had their arms round each other\\'s waists, and were\\r\\nkissing each other in every corner. Mons. Sauvetanin never took his eyes\\r\\noff Anna; he no doubt felt that ardor, that sort of expectation which\\r\\nall men, even if they are old and ugly, feel for women of a certain\\r\\nstamp, as if they owed a little of themselves, professionally, to all\\r\\nmales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down, and the wedding-breakfast began; the relations sitting at\\r\\none end of the table and the young people at the other. Mme. Touchard,\\r\\nthe mother, presided on the right and the bride on the left. Anna looked\\r\\nafter everybody, saw that the glasses were kept filled and the plates\\r\\nwell supplied. The guests evidently felt a certain respectful\\r\\nembarrassment at the sight of all the sumptuousness of the rooms and at\\r\\nthe lavish manner in which they were treated. They all ate heartily of\\r\\nthe good things provided, but there were no jokes such as are prevalent\\r\\nat weddings of that sort; it was all too grand, and it made them feel\\r\\nuncomfortable. Old Madame Touchard, who was fond of a bit of fun, tried\\r\\nto enliven matters a little, and at the beginning of the dessert she\\r\\nexclaimed: \"I say, Philip, do sing us something.\" The neighbors in their\\r\\nstreet considered that he had the finest voice in all Havre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom got up, smiled, and turning to his sister-in-law, from\\r\\npoliteness and gallantry, tried to think of something suitable for the\\r\\noccasion, something serious and correct, to harmonize with the\\r\\nseriousness of the repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna had a satisfied look on her face, and leaned back in her chair to\\r\\nlisten, and all assumed looks of attention, though prepared to smile\\r\\nshould smiles be called for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singer announced, \"The Accursed Bread,\" and extending his right arm,\\r\\nwhich made his coat ruck up into his neck, he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was decidedly long, three verses of eight lines each, with the last\\r\\nline and the last line but one repeated twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went well for the first two verses; they were the usual commonplaces\\r\\nabout bread gained by honest labor and by dishonesty. The aunt and the\\r\\nbride wept outright. The cook, who was present, at the end of the first\\r\\nverse looked at a roll which she held in her hand with running eyes, as\\r\\nif they applied to her, while all applauded vigorously. At the end of\\r\\nthe second verse the two servants, who were standing with their backs\\r\\nto the wall, joined loudly in the chorus, and the aunt and the bride\\r\\nwept outright. Daddy Taille blew his nose with the noise of a trombone,\\r\\nand old Touchard brandished a whole loaf half over the table, and the\\r\\ncook shed silent tears on the crust which she was still holding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmidst the general emotion M. Sauvetanin said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the right sort of song; very different to the nasty, risky\\r\\nthings one generally hears at weddings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna, who was visibly affected, kissed her hand to her sister, and\\r\\npointed to her husband with an affectionate nod, as if to congratulate\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntoxicated by his success, the young man continued, and unfortunately\\r\\nthe last verse contained the words about the bread of dishonor gained by\\r\\nyoung girls who had been led astray from the paths of virtue. No one\\r\\ntook up the refrain about this bread, supposed to be eaten with tears,\\r\\nexcept old Touchard and the two servants. Anna had grown deadly pale,\\r\\nand cast down her eyes, while the bridegroom looked from one to the\\r\\nother without understanding the reason for this sudden coldness, and the\\r\\ncook hastily dropped the crust as if it were poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMons. Sauvetanin said solemnly, in order to save the situation: \"That\\r\\nlast couplet is not at all necessary;\" and Daddy Taille, who had got red\\r\\nup to the ears, looked round the table fiercely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Anna, with her eyes swimming in tears, told the servants, in the\\r\\nfaltering voice of a woman trying to stifle her sobs, to bring the\\r\\nchampagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the guests were suddenly seized with exuberant joy, and all their\\r\\nfaces became radiant again. And when old Touchard, who had seen, felt,\\r\\nand understood nothing of what was going on, and, pointing to the guests\\r\\nso as to emphasize his words, sang the last words of the refrain:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread,\" the whole company,\\r\\nwhen they saw the champagne bottles, with their necks covered with gold\\r\\nfoil appear, burst out singing, as if electrified by the sight:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread.\"',\n"," 'WHAT WAS REALLY THE MATTER WITH ANDREW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer\\'s house looked on to the Square. Behind it, there was a nice,\\r\\nwell-kept garden, with a back entrance into a narrow street which was\\r\\nalmost always deserted, and from which it was separated by a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of that garden Maitre[14] Moreau\\'s wife had promised, for\\r\\nthe first time, to meet Captain Sommerive, who had been making love to\\r\\nher for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband had gone to Paris for a week, so she was quite free for the\\r\\ntime being. The Captain had begged so hard, and had used such loving\\r\\nwords, she was certain that he loved her so ardently, and she felt so\\r\\nisolated, so misunderstood, so neglected amidst all the law business\\r\\nwhich seemed to be her husband\\'s sole pleasure, that she had given away\\r\\nher heart without even asking herself whether it would give her anything\\r\\nelse at some future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, after some months of platonic love, of pressing of hands, of\\r\\nkisses rapidly stolen behind a door, the Captain had declared that he\\r\\nwould ask permission to exchange, and leave the town immediately, if she\\r\\nwould not grant him a meeting, a real meeting, during her husband\\'s\\r\\nabsence; and so at length she yielded to his importunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she was waiting, close against the wall, with a beating heart,\\r\\ntrembling at the slightest sound, and when at length she heard somebody\\r\\nclimbing up the wall, she very nearly ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose it were not he, but a thief? But no; someone called out softly,\\r\\n\"_Matilda_!\" and when she replied, \"_Etienne_!\" a man jumped on to the\\r\\npath with a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was he,--and what a kiss!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time they remained in each other\\'s arms, with united lips.\\r\\nBut suddenly a fine rain began to fall, and the drops from the leaves\\r\\nfell on to her neck and made her start. Whereupon he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Matilda, my adored one, my darling, my angel, let us go indoors. It is\\r\\ntwelve o\\'clock, we can have nothing to fear; please let us go to your\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dearest; I am too frightened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he held her in his arms, and whispered in her ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your servants sleep on the third floor, looking on to the Square, and\\r\\nyour room, on the first, looks on to the garden, so nobody can hear us.\\r\\nI love you so that I wish to love you entirely, from head to foot.\" And\\r\\nhe embraced her vehemently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe resisted still, frightened and even ashamed. But he put his arms\\r\\nround her, lifted her up, and carried her off under the rain, which was\\r\\nby this time descending in torrents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was open; they groped their way upstairs; and when they were in\\r\\nthe room he bolted the door while she lit a match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she fell, half fainting, into a chair, while he knelt down beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, she said, panting:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Etienne, please let me remain a virtuous woman; I should be\\r\\ntoo angry with you afterwards; and after all, it is so horrid, so\\r\\ncommon. Cannot we love each other with a spiritual love only?... Oh!\\r\\nEtienne!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was inexorable, and then she tried to get up and escape from his\\r\\nattacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her fright she ran to the bed in order to hide herself behind the\\r\\ncurtains; but it was a dangerous place of refuge, and he followed her.\\r\\nBut in haste he took off his sword too quickly, and it fell on the floor\\r\\nwith a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then--a prolonged, shrill child\\'s cry came from the next room, the\\r\\ndoor of which had remained open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have awakened the child,\" she whispered, \"and perhaps he will not\\r\\ngo to sleep again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was only fifteen months old, and slept in a room opening out of hers,\\r\\nso that she might be able to hear him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain exclaimed, ardently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does it matter, Matilda? How I love you; you must come to me,\\r\\nMatilda.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she struggled, and resisted in her fright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! Just listen how he is crying; he will wake up the nurse, and\\r\\nwhat should we do if she were to come? We should be lost. Just listen to\\r\\nme, Etienne. When he screams at night his father always takes him into\\r\\nour bed, and he is quiet immediately; it is the only means of keeping\\r\\nhim still. Do let me take him....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child roared, uttered shrill screams, which pierced the thickest\\r\\nwalls, so as to be heard by passers-by in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his consternation, the Captain got up, and Matilda jumped out and\\r\\ntook the child into her bed, when he was quiet at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtienne sat astride on a chair, and made a cigarette, and in about five\\r\\nminutes Andrew went to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take him back,\" his mother said; and she took him back very\\r\\ncarefully to his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned, the Captain was waiting for her with open arms, and\\r\\nput his arms round her in a transport of love, while she, embracing him\\r\\nmore closely, said, stammering:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Etienne, my darling, if you only knew how I love you; how....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew began to cry again, and he, in a rage, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confound it all, won\\'t the little brute be quiet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, the little brute would not be quiet, but howled all the louder, on\\r\\nthe contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought she heard a noise downstairs; no doubt the nurse was coming,\\r\\nso she jumped up, and took the child into bed, and he grew quiet\\r\\ndirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree times she put him back, and three times she had to fetch him\\r\\nagain, and an hour before daybreak the Captain had to go, swearing like\\r\\nthe proverbial trooper; and, to calm his impatience, Matilda promised to\\r\\nreceive him again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course he came, more impatient and ardent than ever, excited by the\\r\\ndelay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took care to put his sword carefully into a corner; he took off his\\r\\nboots like a thief, and spoke so low that Matilda could hardly hear him.\\r\\nAt last, he was just going to be really happy when the floor, or some\\r\\npiece of furniture, or perhaps the bed itself, creaked; it sounded as\\r\\nif something had broken; and in a moment a cry, feeble at first, but\\r\\nwhich grew louder every moment, made itself heard. Andrew was awake\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe _yapped_ like a fox, and there was not the slightest doubt that if he\\r\\nwent on like that the whole house would awake; so his mother, not\\r\\nknowing what to do, got up and brought him. The Captain was more furious\\r\\nthan ever, but did not move, and very carefully he put out his hand,\\r\\ntook a small piece of the child\\'s skin between his two fingers, no\\r\\nmatter where it was, the thighs or elsewhere, and pinched it. The little\\r\\none struggled and screamed in a deafening manner, but his tormentor\\r\\npinched everywhere furiously and more vigorously. He took a morsel of\\r\\nflesh and twisted and turned it, and then let go in order to take hold\\r\\nof another piece, and then another and another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child screamed like a chicken that is having its throat cut, or a\\r\\ndog that is being mercilessly beaten. His mother caressed him, kissed\\r\\nhim, and tried to stifle his cries by her tenderness; but Andrew grew\\r\\npurple, as if he were going into convulsions, and kicked and struggled\\r\\nwith his little arms and legs in an alarming manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain said, softly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try and take him back to his cradle; perhaps he will be quiet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Matilda went into the other room with the child in her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he was out of his mother\\'s bed he cried less loudly, and when\\r\\nhe was in his own he was quiet, with exception of a few broken sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the night was tranquil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night he came again. As he happened to speak rather loudly,\\r\\nAndrew awoke again and began to scream. His mother went and fetched him\\r\\nimmediately, but the Captain pinched so hard and long that the child was\\r\\nnearly suffocated by its cries, and its eyes turned in its head and it\\r\\nfoamed at the mouth; as soon as it was back in its cradle it was quiet,\\r\\nand in four days Andrew did not cry any more to come into his mother\\'s\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday evening the lawyer returned, and took his place again at the\\r\\ndomestic hearth and in the conjugal chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was tired with his journey he went to bed early; but he had not\\r\\nlong lain down when he said to his wife:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, how is it that Andrew is not crying? Just go and fetch him,\\r\\nMatilda; I like to feel that he is between us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up and brought the child, but as soon as he saw that he was in\\r\\nthat bed, in which he had been so fond of sleeping a few days\\r\\npreviously, he wriggled and screamed so violently in his fright that she\\r\\nhad to take him back to his cradle.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Moreau could not get over his surprise. \"What a very funny thing!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with him this evening? I suppose he is sleepy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been like that all the time that you were away; I have never\\r\\nbeen able to have him in bed with me once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the child woke up and began to laugh and play with his\\r\\ntoys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer, who was an affectionate man, got up, kissed his offspring,\\r\\nand took him into his arms to carry him to their bed. Andrew laughed,\\r\\nwith that vacant laugh of little creatures whose ideas are still vague.\\r\\nHe suddenly saw the bed and his mother in it, and his happy little face\\r\\npuckered up, till suddenly he began to scream furiously, and struggled\\r\\nas if he were going to be put to the torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment his father said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be something the matter with the child,\" and mechanically he\\r\\nlifted up his little nightshirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe uttered a prolonged \"O--o--h!\" of astonishment. The child\\'s calves,\\r\\nthighs, and buttocks were covered with blue spots as big as halfpennies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look, Matilda!\" the father exclaimed; \"this is horrible!\" And the\\r\\nmother rushed forward in a fright. It was horrible; no doubt the\\r\\nbeginning of some sort of leprosy, of one of those strange affections of\\r\\nthe skin which doctors are often at a loss to account for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parents looked at one another in consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must send for the doctor,\" the father said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Matilda, pale as death, was looking at her child, who was spotted\\r\\nlike a leopard. Then suddenly uttering a violent cry, as if she had seen\\r\\nsomething that filled her with horror, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! the wretch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his astonishment M. Moreau asked: \"What are you talking about? What\\r\\nwretch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got red up to the roots of her hair, and stammered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing! but I think I can guess--it must be--we ought to send for\\r\\nthe doctor ... it must be that wretch of a nurse who has been pinching\\r\\nthe poor child to make him keep quiet when he cries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his rage the lawyer sent for the nurse, and very nearly beat her.\\r\\nShe denied it most impudently, but was instantly dismissed, and the\\r\\nMunicipality having been informed of her conduct, she will find it a\\r\\nhard matter to get another situation.',\n"," 'MY LANDLADY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time (George Kervelen said) I was living in furnished lodgings\\r\\nin the Rue des Saints-Pères.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my father had made up his mind that I should go to Paris to\\r\\ncontinue my law studies, there had been a long discussion about settling\\r\\neverything. My allowance had been fixed at first at two thousand five\\r\\nhundred francs, but my poor mother was so anxious, that she said to my\\r\\nfather that if I spent my money badly I might not take enough to eat,\\r\\nand then my health would suffer, and so it was settled that a\\r\\ncomfortable boarding-house should be found for me, and that the amount\\r\\nshould be paid to the proprietor himself, or herself, every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of our neighbors told us of a certain Mme. Kergaran, a native of\\r\\nBrittany, who took in boarders, and so my father arranged matters by\\r\\nletter with this respectable person, at whose house I and my luggage\\r\\narrived one evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was a woman of about forty. She was very stout, had a\\r\\nvoice like a drill-sergeant, and decided everything in a very abrupt\\r\\nmanner. Her house was narrow, with only one window opening on to the\\r\\nstreet on each story, which rather gave it the appearance of a ladder of\\r\\nwindows, or better, perhaps, of a slice of a house sandwiched in between\\r\\ntwo others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady lived on the first floor with her servant, the kitchen and\\r\\ndining-room were on the second, and four boarders from Brittany lived\\r\\non the third and fourth, and I had two rooms on the fifth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little dark corkscrew staircase led up to these attics. All day long\\r\\nMme. Kergaran was up and down these stairs like a captain on board ship.\\r\\nTen times a day she would go into each room, noisily superintending\\r\\neverything, seeing that the beds were properly made, the clothes well\\r\\nbrushed, if the attendance were all that it should be; in a word, she\\r\\nlooked after her boarders like a mother, and better than a mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon made the acquaintance of my four fellow-countrymen. Two were\\r\\nmedical and two were law students, but all impartially endured the\\r\\nlandlady\\'s despotic yoke. They were as frightened of her as a boy\\r\\nrobbing an orchard would be of a rural policeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, immediately felt that I wished to be independent; it is my\\r\\nnature to rebel. I declared at once that I meant to come in at whatever\\r\\ntime I liked, for Mme. Kergaran had fixed twelve o\\'clock at night as the\\r\\nlimit. On hearing this she looked at me for a few moments, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is quite impossible; I cannot have Annette awakened at any hour of\\r\\nthe night. You can have nothing to do out-of-doors at such a time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI replied firmly that, according to the law, she was obliged to open the\\r\\ndoor for me at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you refuse,\" I said, \"I shall get a policeman to witness the fact,\\r\\nand go and get a bed at some hotel, at your expense, in which I shall be\\r\\nfully justified. You will, therefore, be obliged either to open the door\\r\\nfor me or to get rid of me. Do which you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed in her face as I told her my conditions. She could not speak\\r\\nfor a moment for surprise, then she tried to negotiate, but I was firm,\\r\\nand she was obliged to yield; and so it was agreed that I should have a\\r\\nlatchkey, on my solemn undertaking that no one else should know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy energy made such a wholesome impression on her that from that time\\r\\nshe treated me with marked favor; she was most attentive, and even\\r\\nshowed me a sort of rough tenderness which was not at all unpleasing.\\r\\nSometimes when I was in a jovial mood I would kiss her by surprise, if\\r\\nonly for the sake of getting the box on the ears which she gave me\\r\\nimmediately afterwards. When I managed to duck my head quickly enough,\\r\\nher hand would pass over me as swiftly as a ball, and I would run away\\r\\nlaughing, while she would call after me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you wretch, I will pay you out for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we soon became real friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I made the acquaintance of a girl who was\\r\\nemployed in a shop, and whom I constantly met. You know what such sort\\r\\nof love affairs are in Paris. One fine day, going to a lecture, you meet\\r\\na work-girl going to work arm-in-arm with a friend. You look at her and\\r\\nfeel that pleasant little shock which the eye of some women gives you.\\r\\nThe next day at the same time, going through the same street, you meet\\r\\nher again, and the next, and the succeeding days. At last you speak, and\\r\\nthe love affair follows its course just like an illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, by the end of three weeks I was on that footing with Emma which\\r\\nprecedes a fall. The fall would indeed have taken place much sooner had\\r\\nI known where to bring it about. The girl lived at home, and utterly\\r\\nrefused to go to an hotel. I did not know how to manage, but at last I\\r\\ntook the desperate resolve to take her to my room some night at about\\r\\neleven o\\'clock, under the pretense of giving her a cup of tea. Mme.\\r\\nKergaran always went to bed at ten, so that we could get in by means of\\r\\nmy latchkey without exciting any attention, and go down again in an hour\\r\\nor two in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good deal of entreaty on my part, Emma accepted my invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not spend a very pleasant day, for I was by no means easy in my\\r\\nmind. I was afraid of complications, of a catastrophe, of some scandal.\\r\\nAt night I went into a café, and drank two cups of coffee, and three or\\r\\nfour glasses of cognac, to give me courage, and when I heard the clock\\r\\nstrike half-past ten, I went slowly to the place of meeting, where she\\r\\nwas already waiting for me. She took my arm in a coaxing manner, and we\\r\\nset off slowly towards my lodgings. The nearer we got to the door the\\r\\nmore nervous I got, and I thought to myself--\"If only Mme. Kergaran is\\r\\nin bed already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to Emma two or three times:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Above all things, don\\'t make any noise on the stairs,\" to which she\\r\\nreplied, laughing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you afraid of being heard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I said, \"but I am afraid of waking the man who sleeps in the room\\r\\nnext to me, who is not at all well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got near the house I felt as frightened as a man does who is\\r\\ngoing to the dentist\\'s. All the windows were dark, so no doubt everybody\\r\\nwas asleep, and I breathed again. I opened the door as carefully as a\\r\\nthief, let my fair companion in, shut it behind me, and went upstairs on\\r\\ntiptoe, holding my breath, and striking wax-matches lest the girl\\r\\nshould make a false step.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we passed the landlady\\'s door I felt my heart beating very quickly,\\r\\nbut we reached the second floor, then the third, and at last the fifth,\\r\\nand got into my room. Victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I only dared to speak in a whisper, and took off my boots so as\\r\\nnot to make any noise. The tea, which I made over a spirit-lamp, was\\r\\nsoon drunk, and then I became pressing, till little by little, as if in\\r\\nplay, I, one by one, took off my companion\\'s clothes, who yielded while\\r\\nresisting, blushing, confused.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had absolutely nothing more on except a short white petticoat when\\r\\nmy door suddenly opened, and Mme. Kergaran appeared with a candle in her\\r\\nhand, in exactly the same costume as Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nI jumped away from her and remained standing up, looking at the two\\r\\nwomen, who were looking at each other. What was going to happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy landlady said, in a lofty tone of voice which I had never heard from\\r\\nher before:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Monsieur Kervelen, I will not have prostitutes in my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Madame Kergaran,\" I stammered, \"the young lady is a friend of\\r\\nmine. She just came in to have a cup of tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People don\\'t take tea in their chemise. You will please make this\\r\\nperson go directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, in a natural state of consternation, began to cry, and hid her\\r\\nface in her petticoat, and I lost my head, not knowing what to do or\\r\\nsay. My landlady added, with irresistible authority:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Help her to dress, and take her out at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly the only thing I could do, so I picked up her dress\\r\\nfrom the floor, put it over her head, and began to fasten it as best I\\r\\ncould. She helped me, crying all the time, hurrying and making all sorts\\r\\nof mistakes and unable to find either buttonholes or laces, while Mme.\\r\\nKergaran stood by motionless, with the candle in her hand, looking at us\\r\\nwith the severity of a judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Emma was dressed, without even stopping to button her boots,\\r\\nshe rushed past the landlady and ran down stairs. I followed her in my\\r\\nslippers and half undressed, and kept repeating: \"Mademoiselle!\\r\\nMademoiselle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I ought to say something to her, but I could not find\\r\\nanything. I overtook her just by the street-door, and tried to take her\\r\\ninto my arms, but she pushed me violently away, saying in a low, nervous\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave me alone, leave me alone!\" and so ran out into the street,\\r\\nclosing the door behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went upstairs again I found that Mme. Kergaran was waiting on the\\r\\nfirst landing, and I went up slowly, expecting, and ready for, anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer door was open, and she called me in, saying in a severe voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to speak to you, M. Kervelen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in, with my head bent. She put her candle on the mantelpiece, and\\r\\nthen, folding her arms over her expansive bosom, which a fine white\\r\\ndressing-jacket hardly covered, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Monsieur Kervelen, you think my house is a house of ill-fame?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not at all proud. I murmured:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, no! But, Mme. Kergaran, you must not be angry; you know what\\r\\nyoung men are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" was her answer, \"that I will not have such creatures here, so\\r\\nyou will understand that. I expect to have my house respected, and I\\r\\nwill not have it lose its reputation, you understand me? I know....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on thus for at least twenty minutes, overwhelming me with the\\r\\ngood name of her house, with reasons for her indignation, and loading me\\r\\nwith severe reproofs. I went to bed crestfallen, and resolved never\\r\\nagain to try such an experiment, so long, at least, as I continued to be\\r\\na lodger of Mme. Kergaran.',\n"," 'THE HORLA, OR MODERN GHOSTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 8._ What a beautiful day! I have spent all the morning lying in the\\r\\ngrass in front of my house, under the enormous plantain tree which\\r\\ncovers it, and shades and shelters the whole of it. I like this part of\\r\\nthe country and I am fond of living here because I am attached to it by\\r\\ndeep roots, profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil\\r\\non which his ancestors were born and died, which attach him to what\\r\\npeople think and what they eat, to the usages as well as to the food,\\r\\nlocal expressions, the peculiar language of the peasants, to the smell\\r\\nof the soil, of the villages and of the atmosphere itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love my house in which I grew up. From my windows I can see the Seine\\r\\nwhich flows by the side of my garden, on the other side of the road,\\r\\nalmost through my grounds, the great wide Seine, which goes to Rouen and\\r\\nHavre, and which is covered with boats passing to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left, down yonder, lies Rouen, that large town with its blue\\r\\nroofs, under its pointed, Gothic towers. They are innumerable, delicate\\r\\nor broad, dominated by the spire of the cathedral, and full of bells\\r\\nwhich sound through the blue air on fine mornings, sending their sweet\\r\\nand distant iron clang, to me; their metallic sound which the breeze\\r\\nwafts in my direction, now stronger and now weaker, according as the\\r\\nwind is stronger or lighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a delicious morning it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eleven o\\'clock, a long line of boats drawn by a steam-tug, as big\\r\\nas a fly, and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke,\\r\\npassed my gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two English schooners, whose red flag fluttered towards the sky,\\r\\nthere came a magnificent Brazilian three-master; it was perfectly white\\r\\nand wonderfully clean and shining. I saluted it, I hardly know why,\\r\\nexcept that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 12._ I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days, and\\r\\nI feel ill, or rather I feel low-spirited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence do these mysterious influences come, which change our happiness\\r\\ninto discouragement, and our self-confidence into diffidence? One might\\r\\nalmost say that the air, the invisible air, is full of unknowable\\r\\nForces, whose mysterious presence we have to endure. I wake up in the\\r\\nbest spirits, with an inclination to sing in my throat. Why? I go down\\r\\nby the side of the water, and suddenly, after walking a short distance,\\r\\nI return home wretched, as if some misfortune were awaiting me there.\\r\\nWhy? Is it a cold shiver which, passing over my skin, has upset my\\r\\nnerves and given me low spirits? Is it the form of the clouds, or the\\r\\ncolor of the sky, or the color of the surrounding objects which is so\\r\\nchangeable, which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my\\r\\neyes? Who can tell? Everything that surrounds us, everything that we see\\r\\nwithout looking at it, everything that we touch without knowing it,\\r\\neverything that we handle without feeling it, all that we meet without\\r\\nclearly distinguishing it, has a rapid, surprising and inexplicable\\r\\neffect upon us and upon our organs, and through them on our ideas and on\\r\\nour heart itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow profound that mystery of the Invisible is! We cannot fathom it with\\r\\nour miserable senses, with our eyes which are unable to perceive what is\\r\\neither too small or too great, too near to, or too far from us; neither\\r\\nthe inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water ... with our ears that\\r\\ndeceive us, for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air in\\r\\nsonorous notes. They are fairies who work the miracle of changing that\\r\\nmovement into noise, and by that metamorphosis give birth to music,\\r\\nwhich makes the mute agitation of nature musical ... with our sense of\\r\\nsmell which is smaller than that of a dog ... with our sense of taste\\r\\nwhich can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our\\r\\nfavor, what a number of fresh things we might discover around us!\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 16._ I am ill, decidedly! I was so well last month! I am feverish,\\r\\nhorribly feverish, or rather I am in a state of feverish enervation,\\r\\nwhich makes my mind suffer as much as my body. I have without ceasing\\r\\nthat horrible sensation of some danger threatening me, that apprehension\\r\\nof some coming misfortune or of approaching death, that presentiment\\r\\nwhich is, no doubt, an attack of some illness which is still unknown,\\r\\nwhich germinates in the flesh and in the blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 18._ I have just come from consulting my medical man, for I could\\r\\nno longer get any sleep. He found that my pulse was high, my eyes\\r\\ndilated, my nerves highly strung, but no alarming symptoms. I must have\\r\\na course of shower baths and of bromide of potassium.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 25._ No change! My state is really very peculiar. As the evening\\r\\ncomes on, an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me, just as\\r\\nif night concealed some terrible menace towards me. I dine quickly, and\\r\\nthen try to read, but I do not understand the words, and can scarcely\\r\\ndistinguish the letters. Then I walk up and down my drawing-room,\\r\\noppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear, the fear of\\r\\nsleep and fear of my bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten o\\'clock I go up to my room. As soon as I have got in I double\\r\\nlock, and bolt it: I am frightened ... of what? Up till the present time\\r\\nI have been frightened of nothing ... I open my cupboards, and look\\r\\nunder my bed; I listen ... I listen ... to what? How strange it is that\\r\\na simple feeling of discomfort, impeded or heightened circulation,\\r\\nperhaps the irritation of a nervous thread, a slight congestion, a small\\r\\ndisturbance in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living\\r\\nmachinery, can turn the most light-hearted of men into a melancholy one,\\r\\nand make a coward of the bravest? Then, I go to bed, and I wait for\\r\\nsleep as a man might wait for the executioner. I wait for its coming\\r\\nwith dread, and my heart beats and my legs tremble, while my whole body\\r\\nshivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes, until the moment when I\\r\\nsuddenly fall asleep, as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant\\r\\nwater in order to drown oneself. I do not feel as I used to do formerly,\\r\\nthis perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me, which is\\r\\ngoing to seize me by the head, to close my eyes and annihilate me,\\r\\ncoming over me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sleep--a long time--two or three hours perhaps--then a dream--no--a\\r\\nnightmare lays hold on me. I feel that I am in bed and asleep ... I feel\\r\\nit and I know it ... and I feel also that somebody is coming close to\\r\\nme, is looking at me, touching me, is getting on to my bed, is kneeling\\r\\non my chest, is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing it ...\\r\\nsqueezing it with all his might in order to strangle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI struggle, bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in\\r\\nour dreams; I try to cry out--but I cannot; I want to move--I cannot; I\\r\\ntry, with the most violent efforts and out of breath, to turn over and\\r\\nthrow off this being which is crushing and suffocating me--I cannot!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then suddenly, I wake up, shaken and bathed in perspiration; I light\\r\\na candle and find that I am alone, and after that crisis, which occurs\\r\\nevery night, I at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 2._ My state has grown worse. What is the matter with me? The\\r\\nbromide does me no good, and the shower baths have no effect whatever.\\r\\nSometimes, in order to tire myself out, though I am fatigued enough\\r\\nalready, I go for a walk in the forest of Roumare. I used to think at\\r\\nfirst that the fresh light and soft air, impregnated with the odor of\\r\\nherbs and leaves, would instill new blood into my veins and impart fresh\\r\\nenergy to my heart. I turned into a broad ride in the wood, and then I\\r\\nturned towards La Bouille, through a narrow path, between two rows of\\r\\nexceedingly tall trees, which placed a thick, green, almost black roof\\r\\nbetween the sky and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden shiver ran through me, not a cold shiver, but a shiver of\\r\\nagony, and so I hastened my steps, uneasy at being alone in the wood,\\r\\nfrightened stupidly and without reason, at the profound solitude.\\r\\nSuddenly it seemed to me as if I were being followed, that somebody was\\r\\nwalking at my heels, close, quite close to me, near enough to touch me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned round suddenly, but I was alone. I saw nothing behind me except\\r\\nthe straight, broad ride, empty and bordered by high trees, horribly\\r\\nempty; on the other side it also extended until it was lost in the\\r\\ndistance, and looked just the same, terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed my eyes. Why? And then I began to turn round on one heel very\\r\\nquickly, just like a top. I nearly fell down, and opened my eyes; the\\r\\ntrees were dancing round me and the earth heaved; I was obliged to sit\\r\\ndown. Then, ah! I no longer remembered how I had come! What a strange\\r\\nidea! What a strange, strange idea! I did not the least know. I started\\r\\noff to the right, and got back into the avenue which had led me into the\\r\\nmiddle of the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 3._ I have had a terrible night. I shall go away for a few weeks,\\r\\nfor no doubt a journey will set me up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 2._ I have come back, quite cured, and have had a most delightful\\r\\ntrip into the bargain. I have been to Mount Saint-Michel, which I had\\r\\nnot seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a sight, when one arrives as I did, at Avranches towards the end of\\r\\nthe day! The town stands on a hill, and I was taken into the public\\r\\ngarden at the extremity of the town. I uttered a cry of astonishment. An\\r\\nextraordinarily large bay lay extended before me, as far as my eyes\\r\\ncould reach, between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist; and\\r\\nin the middle of this immense yellow bay, under a clear, golden sky, a\\r\\npeculiar hill rose up, somber and pointed in the midst of the sand. The\\r\\nsun had just disappeared, and under the still flaming sky the outline\\r\\nof that fantastic rock stood out, which bears on its summit a fantastic\\r\\nmonument.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak I went to it. The tide was low as it had been the night\\r\\nbefore, and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as I approached\\r\\nit. After several hours walking, I reached the enormous mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich supports the little town, dominated by the great church. Having\\r\\nclimbed the steep and narrow street, I entered the most wonderful Gothic\\r\\nbuilding that has ever been built to God on earth, as large as a town,\\r\\nfull of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs, and lofty\\r\\ngalleries supported by delicate columns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of\\r\\nlace, covered with towers, with slender belfries to which spiral\\r\\nstaircases ascend, and which raise their strange heads that bristle with\\r\\nchimeras, with devils, with fantastic animals, with monstrous flowers,\\r\\nand which are joined together by finely carved arches, to the blue sky\\r\\nby day, and to the black sky by night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached the summit, I said to the monk who accompanied me:\\r\\n\"Father, how happy you must be here!\" And he replied: \"It is very windy,\\r\\nMonsieur;\" and so we began to talk while watching the rising tide, which\\r\\nran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the monk told me stories, all the old stories belonging to the\\r\\nplace, legends, nothing but legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them struck me forcibly. The country people, those belonging to\\r\\nthe Mornet, declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the\\r\\nsand, and then that one hears two goats bleat, one with a strong, the\\r\\nother with a weak voice. Incredulous people declare that it is nothing\\r\\nbut the cry of the sea birds, which occasionally resembles bleatings,\\r\\nand occasionally human lamentations; but belated fishermen swear that\\r\\nthey have met an old shepherd, whose head, which is covered by his\\r\\ncloak, they can never see, wandering on the downs, between two tides,\\r\\nround the little town placed so far out of the world, and who is guiding\\r\\nand walking before them, a he-goat with a man\\'s face, and a she-goat\\r\\nwith a woman\\'s face, and both of them with white hair; and talking\\r\\nincessantly, quarreling in a strange language, and then suddenly ceasing\\r\\nto talk in order to bleat with all their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you believe it?\" I asked the monk. \"I scarcely know,\" he replied,\\r\\nand I continued: \"If there are other beings besides ourselves on this\\r\\nearth, how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time, or why\\r\\nhave you not seen them? How is it that I have not seen them?\" He\\r\\nreplied: \"Do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists? Look\\r\\nhere; there is the wind, which is the strongest force in nature, which\\r\\nknocks down men, and blows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea\\r\\ninto mountains of water, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the\\r\\nbreakers; the wind which kills, which whistles, which sighs, which\\r\\nroars,--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It exists for all\\r\\nthat, however.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was silent before this simple reasoning. That man was a philosopher,\\r\\nor perhaps a fool; I could not say which exactly, so I held my tongue.\\r\\nWhat he had said, had often been in my own thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 3._ I have slept badly; certainly there is some feverish influence\\r\\nhere, for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I am. When I went\\r\\nback home yesterday, I noticed his singular paleness, and I asked him:\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, Jean?\" \"The matter is that I never get any\\r\\nrest, and my nights devour my days. Since your departure, Monsieur,\\r\\nthere has been a spell over me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the other servants are all well, but I am very frightened of\\r\\nhaving another attack, myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 4._ I am decidedly taken again; for my old nightmares have\\r\\nreturned. Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my\\r\\nlife from between my lips with his mouth. Yes, he was sucking it out of\\r\\nmy neck, like a leech would have done. Then he got up, satiated, and I\\r\\nwoke up, so beaten, crushed and annihilated that I could not move. If\\r\\nthis continues for a few days, I shall certainly go away again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 5._ Have I lost my reason? What has happened, what I saw last\\r\\nnight is so strange, that my head wanders when I think of it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I do now every evening, I had locked my door, and then, being\\r\\nthirsty, I drank half a glass of water, and I accidentally noticed that\\r\\nthe water-bottle was full up to the cut-glass stopper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps, from which I\\r\\nwas aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes\\r\\nup with a knife in his chest, and who is rattling in his throat, covered\\r\\nwith blood, and who can no longer breathe and is going to die and does\\r\\nnot understand anything at all about it--there it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recovered my senses, I was thirsty again, so I lit a candle and\\r\\nwent to the table on which my water-bottle was. I lifted it up and\\r\\ntilted it over my glass, but nothing came out. It was empty! It was\\r\\ncompletely empty! At first I could not understand it at all, and then\\r\\nsuddenly I was seized by such a terrible feeling that I had to sit down,\\r\\nor rather I fell into a chair! Then I sprang up with a bound to look\\r\\nabout me, and then I sat down again, overcome by astonishment and fear,\\r\\nin front of the transparent crystal bottle! I looked at it with fixed\\r\\neyes, trying to conjecture, and my hands trembled! Somebody had drunk\\r\\nthe water, but who? I? I without any doubt. It could surely only be I?\\r\\nIn that case I was a somnambulist. I lived, without knowing it, that\\r\\ndouble mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not two\\r\\nbeings in us, or whether a strange, unknowable and invisible being does\\r\\nnot at such moments, when our soul is in a state of torpor, animate our\\r\\ncaptive body which obeys this other being, as it does us ourselves, and\\r\\nmore than it does ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! Who will understand my horrible agony? Who will understand the\\r\\nemotion of a man who is sound in mind, wide awake, full of sound sense,\\r\\nand who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has\\r\\ndisappeared while he was asleep, through the glass of a water-bottle!\\r\\nAnd I remained there until it was daylight, without venturing to go to\\r\\nbed again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 6._ I am going mad. Again all the contents of my water-bottle have\\r\\nbeen drunk during the night;--or rather, I have drunk it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is it I? Is it I? Who could it be? Who? Oh! God! Am I going mad? Who\\r\\nwill save me?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 10._ I have just been through some surprising ordeals. Decidedly I\\r\\nam mad! And yet!...\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, before going to bed, I put some wine, milk, water, bread and\\r\\nstrawberries on my table. Somebody drank--I drank--all the water and a\\r\\nlittle of the milk, but neither the wine, bread nor the strawberries\\r\\nwere touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment, with the same\\r\\nresults, and on July 8, I left out the water and the milk and nothing\\r\\nwas touched.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, on July 9 I put only water and milk on my table, taking care to\\r\\nwrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers. Then I\\r\\nrubbed my lips, my beard and my hands with pencil lead, and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrresistible sleep seized me, which was soon followed by a terrible\\r\\nawakening. I had not moved, and my sheets were not marked. I rushed to\\r\\nthe table. The muslin round the bottles remained intact; I undid the\\r\\nstring, trembling with fear. All the water had been drunk, and so had\\r\\nthe milk! Ah! Great God!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI must start for Paris immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 12._ Paris. I must have lost my head during the last few days! I\\r\\nmust be the plaything of my enervated imagination, unless I am really a\\r\\nsomnambulist, or that I have been brought under the power of one of\\r\\nthose influences which have been proved to exist, but which have\\r\\nhitherto been inexplicable, which are called suggestions. In any case,\\r\\nmy mental state bordered on madness, and twenty-four hours of Paris\\r\\nsufficed to restore me to my equilibrium.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which\\r\\ninstilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me, I wound up my\\r\\nevening at the _Théâtre-Français_. A play by Alexandre Dumas the\\r\\nYounger was being acted, and his active and powerful mind completed my\\r\\ncure. Certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds. We require men\\r\\nwho can think and can talk, around us. When we are alone for a long\\r\\ntime, we people space with phantoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits. Amid\\r\\nthe jostling of the crowd I thought, not without irony, of my terrors\\r\\nand surmises of the previous week, because I believed, yes, I believed,\\r\\nthat an invisible being lived beneath my roof. How weak our head is, and\\r\\nhow quickly it is terrified and goes astray, as soon as we are struck by\\r\\na small, incomprehensible fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of concluding with these simple words: \"I do not understand\\r\\nbecause the cause escapes me,\" we immediately imagine terrible mysteries\\r\\nand supernatural powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 14._ _Fête_ of the Republic. I walked through the streets, and the\\r\\ncrackers and flags amused me like a child. Still it is very foolish to\\r\\nbe merry on a fixed date, by a Government decree. The populace, an\\r\\nimbecile flock of sheep, now steadily patient, and now in ferocious\\r\\nrevolt. Say to it: \"Amuse yourself,\" and it amuses itself. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Go and fight with your neighbor,\" and it goes and fights. Say to it:\\r\\n\"Vote for the Emperor,\" and it votes for the Emperor, and then say to\\r\\nit: \"Vote for the Republic,\" and it votes for the Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who direct it are also stupid; but instead of obeying men, they\\r\\nobey principles, which can only be stupid, sterile and false, for the\\r\\nvery reason that they are principles, that is to say, ideas which are\\r\\nconsidered as certain and unchangeable, in this world where one is\\r\\ncertain of nothing, since light is an illusion and noise is an illusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 16._ I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was dining with my cousin Madame Sablé, whose husband is colonel of\\r\\nthe 76th Chasseurs at Limoges. There were two young women there, one of\\r\\nwhom had married a medical man, Dr. Parent, who devotes himself a great\\r\\ndeal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which\\r\\nat this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe related to us at some length the remarkable results obtained by\\r\\nEnglish scientists and the doctors of the medical school at Nancy, and\\r\\nthe facts which he adduced, appeared to me so strange, that I declared\\r\\nthat I was altogether incredulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are,\" he declared, \"on the point of discovering one of the most\\r\\nimportant secrets of nature, I mean to say, one of its most important\\r\\nsecrets on this earth, for there are certainly some which are of a\\r\\ndifferent kind of importance up in the stars, yonder. Ever since man has\\r\\nthought, since he has been able to express and write down his thoughts,\\r\\nhe has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable to his\\r\\ncoarse and imperfect senses, and he endeavors to supplement the want of\\r\\npower of his organs, by the efforts of his intellect. As long as that\\r\\nintellect still remained in its elementary stage, this intercourse with\\r\\ninvisible spirits, assumed forms which were commonplace though\\r\\nterrifying. Thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural, the\\r\\nlegends of wandering spirits, of fairies, of gnomes, ghosts, I might\\r\\neven say the legend of God, for our conceptions of the workman-creator,\\r\\nfrom whatever religion they may have come down to us, are certainly the\\r\\nmost mediocre, the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that\\r\\never sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures. Nothing is\\r\\ntruer than what Voltaire says: \\'God made man in His own image, but man\\r\\nhas certainly paid Him back again.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for rather more than a century, men seem to have had a presentiment\\r\\nof something new. Mesmer and some others have put us on an unexpected\\r\\ntrack, and especially within the last two or three years, we have\\r\\narrived at really surprising results.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who is also very incredulous, smiled, and Doctor Parent said\\r\\nto her: \"Would you like me to try and send you to sleep, Madame?\" \"Yes,\\r\\ncertainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in an easy-chair, and he began to look at her fixedly, so\\r\\nas to fascinate her. I suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable, with\\r\\na beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat. I saw that Madame\\r\\nSablé\\'s eyes were growing heavy, her mouth twitched and her bosom\\r\\nheaved, and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand behind her,\" the doctor said to me, and so I took a seat behind\\r\\nher. He put a visiting-card into her hands, and said to her: \"This is a\\r\\nlooking-glass; what do you see in it?\" And she replied: \"I see my\\r\\ncousin.\" \"What is he doing?\" \"He is twisting his moustache.\" \"And now?\"\\r\\n\"He is taking a photograph out of his pocket.\" \"Whose photograph is it?\"\\r\\n\"His own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was true, and that photograph had been given me that same evening\\r\\nat the hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is his attitude in this portrait?\" \"He is standing up with his hat\\r\\nin his hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she saw on that card, on that piece of white paste-board, as if she\\r\\nhad seen it in a looking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young women were frightened, and exclaimed: \"That is quite enough!\\r\\nQuite, quite enough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the doctor said to her authoritatively: \"You will get up at eight\\r\\no\\'clock to-morrow morning; then you will go and call on your cousin at\\r\\nhis hotel and ask him to lend you five thousands francs which your\\r\\nhusband demands of you, and which he will ask for when he sets out on\\r\\nhis coming journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn returning to my hotel, I thought over this curious _séance_ and I was\\r\\nassailed by doubts, not as to my cousin\\'s absolute and undoubted good\\r\\nfaith, for I had known her as well as if she had been my own sister ever\\r\\nsince she was a child, but as to a possible trick on the doctor\\'s part.\\r\\nHad not he, perhaps, kept a glass hidden in his hand, which he showed to\\r\\nthe young woman in her sleep, at the same time as he did the card?\\r\\nProfessional conjurors do things which are just as singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I went home and to bed, and this morning, at about half past eight, I\\r\\nwas awakened by my footman, who said to me: \"Madame Sablé has asked to\\r\\nsee you immediately, Monsieur,\" so I dressed hastily and went to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in some agitation, with her eyes on the floor, and without\\r\\nraising her veil she said to me: \"My dear cousin, I am going to ask a\\r\\ngreat favor of you.\" \"What is it, cousin?\" \"I do not like to tell you,\\r\\nand yet I must. I am in absolute want of five thousand francs.\" \"What,\\r\\nyou?\" \"Yes, I, or rather my husband, who has asked me to procure the\\r\\nmoney for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so stupefied that I stammered out my answers. I asked myself\\r\\nwhether she had not really been making fun of me with Doctor Parent, if\\r\\nit were not merely a very well-acted farce which had been got up\\r\\nbeforehand. On looking at her attentively, however, my doubts\\r\\ndisappeared. She was trembling with grief, so painful was this step to\\r\\nher, and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that she was very rich and so I continued: \"What! Has not your\\r\\nhusband five thousand francs at his disposal! Come, think. Are you sure\\r\\nthat he commissioned you to ask me for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated for a few seconds, as if she were making a great effort to\\r\\nsearch her memory, and then she replied: \"Yes ... yes, I am quite sure\\r\\nof it.\" \"He has written to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again and reflected, and I guessed the torture of her\\r\\nthoughts. She did not know. She only knew that she was to borrow five\\r\\nthousand francs of me for her husband. So she told a lie. \"Yes, he has\\r\\nwritten to me.\" \"When pray? You did not mention it to me yesterday.\" \"I\\r\\nreceived his letter this morning.\" \"Can you show it me?\" \"No; no ... no\\r\\n... it contained private matters ... things too personal to ourselves\\r\\n... I burnt it.\" \"So your husband runs into debt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated again, and then murmured: \"I do not know.\" Thereupon I\\r\\nsaid bluntly: \"I have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this\\r\\nmoment, my dear cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered a kind of a cry as if she were in pain and said: \"Oh! oh I\\r\\nbeseech you, I beseech you to get them for me....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me! I\\r\\nheard her voice change its tone; she wept and stammered, harassed and\\r\\ndominated by the irresistible order that she had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! oh! I beg you to ... if you knew what I am suffering.... I want\\r\\nthem to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had pity on her: \"You shall have them by and by, I swear to you.\" \"Oh!\\r\\nthank you! thank you! How kind you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI continued: \"Do you remember what took place at your house last night?\"\\r\\n\"Yes.\" \"Do you remember that Doctor Parent sent you to sleep?\" \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Very well then; he ordered you to come to me this morning to borrow\\r\\nfive thousand francs, and at this moment you are obeying that\\r\\nsuggestion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered for a few moments, and then replied: \"But as it is my\\r\\nhusband who wants them....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a whole hour I tried to convince her, but could not succeed, and\\r\\nwhen she had gone I went to the doctor. He was just going out, and he\\r\\nlistened to me with a smile, and said: \"Do you believe now?\" \"Yes, I\\r\\ncannot help it.\" \"Let us go to your cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was already dozing on a couch, overcome with fatigue. The doctor\\r\\nfelt her pulse, looked at her for some time with one hand raised towards\\r\\nher eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of\\r\\nthis magnetic influence, and when she was asleep, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer! You\\r\\nmust, therefore, forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you,\\r\\nand, if he speaks to you about it, you will not understand him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he woke her up, and I took out a pocketbook and said: \"Here is what\\r\\nyou asked me for this morning, my dear cousin.\" But she was so\\r\\nsurprised, that I did not venture to persist; nevertheless, I tried to\\r\\nrecall the circumstance to her, but she denied it vigorously, thought\\r\\nthat I was making fun of her, and in the end, very nearly lost her\\r\\ntemper.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere! I have just come back, and I have not been able to eat any lunch,\\r\\nfor this experiment has altogether upset me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 19._ Many people to whom I have told the adventure, have laughed\\r\\nat me. I no longer know what to think. The wise man says: Perhaps?\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 21._ I dined at Bougival, and then I spent the evening at a\\r\\nboatmen\\'s ball. Decidedly everything depends on place and surroundings.\\r\\nIt would be the height of folly to believe in the supernatural on the\\r\\n_île de la Grenouillière_[15] ... but on the top of Mont\\r\\nSaint-Michel?... and in India? We are terribly under the influence of\\r\\nour surroundings. I shall return home next week.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 30._ I came back to my own house yesterday. Everything is going on\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 2._ Nothing new. It is splendid weather, and I spent my days in\\r\\nwatching the Seine flow past.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 4._ Quarrels among my servants. They declare that the glasses\\r\\nare broken in the cupboards at night. The footman accuses the cook, who\\r\\naccuses the needle woman, who accuses the other two. Who is the culprit?\\r\\nA clever person, to be able to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 6._ This time, I am not mad. I have seen ... I have seen ... I\\r\\nhave seen!... I can doubt no longer ... I have seen it!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI was walking at two o\\'clock among my rose trees, in the full sunlight\\r\\n... in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall. As\\r\\nI stopped to look at a _Géant de Bataille_, which had three splendid\\r\\nblooms, I distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend, close to\\r\\nme, as if an invisible hand had bent it, and then break, as if that hand\\r\\nhad picked it! Then the flower raised itself, following the curve which\\r\\na hand would have described in carrying it towards a mouth, and it\\r\\nremained suspended in the transparent air, all alone and motionless, a\\r\\nterrible red spot, three yards from my eyes. In desperation I rushed at\\r\\nit to take it! I found nothing; it had disappeared. Then I was seized\\r\\nwith furious rage against myself, for it is not allowable for a\\r\\nreasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was it a hallucination? I turned round to look for the stalk, and I\\r\\nfound it immediately under the bush, freshly broken, between two other\\r\\nroses which remained on the branch, and I returned home then, with a\\r\\nmuch disturbed mind; for I am certain now, as certain as I am of the\\r\\nalternation of day and night, that there exists close to me an invisible\\r\\nbeing that lives on milk and on water, which can touch objects, take\\r\\nthem and change their places; which is, consequently, endowed with a\\r\\nmaterial nature, although it is imperceptible to our senses, and which\\r\\nlives as I do, under my roof....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 7._ I slept tranquilly. He drank the water out of my decanter,\\r\\nbut did not disturb my sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask myself whether I am mad. As I was walking just now in the sun by\\r\\nthe river side, doubts as to my own sanity arose in me; not vague doubts\\r\\nsuch as I have had hitherto, but precise and absolute doubts. I have\\r\\nseen mad people, and I have known some who have been quite intelligent,\\r\\nlucid, even clear-sighted in every concern of life, except on one point.\\r\\nThey spoke clearly, readily, profoundly on everything, when suddenly\\r\\ntheir thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and broke to\\r\\npieces there, and were dispersed and foundered in that furious and\\r\\nterrible sea, full of bounding waves, fogs and squalls, which is called\\r\\n_madness_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI certainly should think that I was mad, absolutely mad, if I were not\\r\\nconscious, did not perfectly know my state, if I did not fathom it by\\r\\nanalyzing it with the most complete lucidity. I should, in fact, be a\\r\\nreasonable man who was laboring under a hallucination. Some unknown\\r\\ndisturbance must have been excited in my brain, one of those\\r\\ndisturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to\\r\\nfix precisely, and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in\\r\\nmy mind and in the order and logic of my ideas. Similar phenomena occur\\r\\nin the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria,\\r\\nwithout causing us any surprise, because our verifying apparatus and our\\r\\nsense of control has gone to sleep, while our imaginative faculty wakes\\r\\nand works. Is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the\\r\\ncerebral finger-board has been paralyzed in me? Some men lose the\\r\\nrecollection of proper names, or of verbs or of numbers or merely of\\r\\ndates, in consequence of an accident. The localization of all the\\r\\nparticles of thought has been proved nowadays; what then would there be\\r\\nsurprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of\\r\\ncertain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being!\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water. The sun was\\r\\nshining brightly on the river and made earth delightful, while it filled\\r\\nmy looks with love for life, for the swallows, whose agility is always\\r\\ndelightful in my eyes, for the plants by the riverside, whose rustling\\r\\nis a pleasure to my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees, however, an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me. It\\r\\nseemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me, were\\r\\npreventing me from going further and were calling me back. I felt that\\r\\npainful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a beloved\\r\\ninvalid at home, and when you are seized by a presentiment that he is\\r\\nworse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, returned in spite of myself, feeling certain that I should\\r\\nfind some bad news awaiting me, a letter or a telegram. There was\\r\\nnothing, however, and I was more surprised and uneasy than if I had had\\r\\nanother fantastic vision.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 8._ I spent a terrible evening, yesterday. He does not show\\r\\nhimself any more, but I feel that he is near me, watching me, looking at\\r\\nme, penetrating me, dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides\\r\\nhimself thus, than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible\\r\\npresence by supernatural phenomena. However, I slept.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 9._ Nothing, but I am afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 10._ Nothing; what will happen to-morrow?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 11._ Still nothing; I cannot stop at home with this fear hanging\\r\\nover me and these thoughts in my mind; I shall go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 12._ Ten o\\'clock at night. All day long I have been trying to\\r\\nget away, and have not been able. I wished to accomplish this simple and\\r\\neasy act of liberty--go out--get into my carriage in order to go to\\r\\nRouen--and I have not been able to do it. What is the reason?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 13._ When one is attacked by certain maladies, all the springs\\r\\nof our physical being appear to be broken, all our energies destroyed,\\r\\nall our muscles relaxed, our bones to have become as soft as our flesh,\\r\\nand our blood as liquid as water. I am experiencing that condition in my\\r\\nmoral being in a strange and distressing manner. I have no longer any\\r\\nstrength, any courage, any self-control, nor even any power to set my\\r\\nown will in motion. I have no power left to _will_ anything, but some\\r\\none does it for me and I obey.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 14._ I am lost! Somebody possesses my soul and governs it!\\r\\nSomebody orders all my acts, all my movements, all my thoughts. I am no\\r\\nlonger anything in myself, nothing except an enslaved and terrified\\r\\nspectator of all the things which I do. I wish to go out; I cannot. He\\r\\ndoes not wish to, and so I remain, trembling and distracted in the\\r\\narmchair in which he keeps me sitting. I merely wish to get up and to\\r\\nrouse myself, so as to think that I am still master of myself: I cannot!\\r\\nI am riveted to my chair, and my chair adheres to the ground in such a\\r\\nmanner that no force could move us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly, I must, I must go to the bottom of my garden to pick some\\r\\nstrawberries and eat them, and I go there. I pick the strawberries and I\\r\\neat them! Oh! my God! my God! Is there a God? If there be one, deliver\\r\\nme! save me! succor me! Pardon! Pity! Mercy! Save me! Oh! what\\r\\nsufferings! what torture! what horror!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 15._ Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was\\r\\npossessed and swayed, when she came to borrow five thousand francs of\\r\\nme. She was under the power of a strange will which had entered into\\r\\nher, like another soul, like another parasitic and ruling soul. Is the\\r\\nworld coming to an end?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who is he, this invisible being that rules me. This unknowable\\r\\nbeing, this rover of a supernatural race?\\r\\n\\r\\nInvisible beings exist, then! How is it then that since the beginning of\\r\\nthe world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner\\r\\nprecisely as they do to me? I have never read anything which resembles\\r\\nwhat goes on in my house. Oh! If I could only leave it, if I could only\\r\\ngo away and flee, so as never to return. I should be saved, but I\\r\\ncannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 16._ I managed to escape to-day for two hours, like a prisoner\\r\\nwho finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open. I suddenly felt\\r\\nthat I was free and that he was far away, and so I gave orders to put\\r\\nthe horses in as quickly as possible, and I drove to Rouen. Oh! How\\r\\ndelightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you: \"Go to Rouen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI made him pull up before the library, and I begged them to lend me Dr.\\r\\nHerrmann Herestauss\\'s treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient\\r\\nand modern world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as I was getting into my carriage, I intended to say: \"To the\\r\\nrailway station!\" but instead of this I shouted,--I did not say, but I\\r\\nshouted--in such a loud voice that all the passers-by turned round:\\r\\n\"Home!\" and I fell back onto the cushion of my carriage, overcome by\\r\\nmental agony. He had found me out and regained possession of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 17._ Oh! What a night! what a night! And yet it seems to me that\\r\\nI ought to rejoice. I read until one o\\'clock in the morning! Herestauss,\\r\\nDoctor of Philosophy and Theogony, wrote the history and the\\r\\nmanifestations of all those invisible beings which hover around man, or\\r\\nof whom he dreams. He describes their origin, their domains, their\\r\\npower; but none of them resembles the one which haunts me. One might say\\r\\nthat man, ever since he has thought, has had a foreboding of, and feared\\r\\na new being, stronger than himself, his successor in this world, and\\r\\nthat, feeling him near, and not being able to foretell the nature of\\r\\nthat master, he has, in his terror, created the whole race of hidden\\r\\nbeings, of vague phantoms born of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving, therefore, read until one o\\'clock in the morning, I went and sat\\r\\ndown at the open window, in order to cool my forehead and my thoughts,\\r\\nin the calm night air. It was very pleasant and warm! How I should have\\r\\nenjoyed such a night formerly!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no moon, but the stars darted out their rays in the dark\\r\\nheavens. Who inhabits those worlds? What forms, what living beings, what\\r\\nanimals are there yonder? What do those who are thinkers in those\\r\\ndistant worlds, know more than we do? What can they do more than we can?\\r\\nWhat do they see which we do not know? Will not one of them, some day or\\r\\nother, traversing space, appear on our earth to conquer it, just as the\\r\\nNorsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations more\\r\\nfeeble than themselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are so weak, so unarmed, so ignorant, so small, we who live on this\\r\\nparticle of mud which turns round in a drop of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell asleep, dreaming thus in the cool night air, and then, having\\r\\nslept for about three quarters of an hour, I opened my eyes without\\r\\nmoving, awakened by I know not what confused and strange sensation. At\\r\\nfirst I saw nothing, and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page of\\r\\na book which had remained open on my table, turned over of its own\\r\\naccord. Not a breath of air had come in at my window, and I was\\r\\nsurprised and waited. In about four minutes, I saw, I saw, yes I saw\\r\\nwith my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the\\r\\nothers, as if a finger had turned it over. My armchair was empty,\\r\\nappeared empty, but I knew that he was there, he, and sitting in my\\r\\nplace, and that he was reading. With a furious bound, the bound of an\\r\\nenraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer, I crossed my\\r\\nroom to seize him, to strangle him, to kill him!... But before I could\\r\\nreach it, my chair fell over as if somebody had ran away from me ... my\\r\\ntable rocked, my lamp fell and went out, and my window closed as if some\\r\\nthief had been surprised and had fled out into the night, shutting it\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he had run away: he had been afraid: he, afraid of me!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ... so ... to-morrow ... or later ... some day or other ... I should\\r\\nbe able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground! Do\\r\\nnot dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters?\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 18._ I have been thinking the whole day long. Oh! yes, I will\\r\\nobey him, follow his impulses, fulfill all his wishes, show myself\\r\\nhumble, submissive, a coward. He is the stronger; but an hour will\\r\\ncome....\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I know, ... I know ... I know all! I have just read the\\r\\nfollowing in the _Revue du Monde Scientifique_: \"A curious piece of news\\r\\ncomes to us from Rio de Janeiro. Madness, an epidemic of madness, which\\r\\nmay be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the people of\\r\\nEurope in the Middle Ages, is at this moment raging in the Province of\\r\\nSan-Paulo. The frightened inhabitants are leaving their houses,\\r\\ndeserting their villages, abandoning their land, saying that they are\\r\\npursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by invisible, though\\r\\ntangible beings, a species of vampire, which feed on their life while\\r\\nthey are asleep, and who, besides, drink water and milk without\\r\\nappearing to touch any other nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Professor Don Pedro Henriques, accompanied by several medical savants,\\r\\nhas gone to the Province of San-Paulo, in order to study the origin and\\r\\nthe manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot, and to\\r\\npropose such measures to the Emperor as may appear to him to be most\\r\\nfitted to restore the mad population to reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! Ah! I remember now that fine Brazilian three-master which passed in\\r\\nfront of my windows as it was going up the Seine, on the 8th of last\\r\\nMay! I thought it looked so pretty, so white and bright! That Being was\\r\\non board of her, coming from there, where its race sprang from. And it\\r\\nsaw me! It saw my house which was also white, and he sprang from the\\r\\nship onto the land. Oh! Good heavens!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I know, I can divine. The reign of man is over, and he has come. He\\r\\nwhom disquieted priests exorcised, whom sorcerers evoked on dark nights,\\r\\nwithout yet seeing him appear, to whom the presentiments of the\\r\\ntransient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful forms\\r\\nof gnomes, spirits, genii, fairies and familiar spirits. After the\\r\\ncoarse conceptions of primitive fear, more clear-sighted men foresaw it\\r\\nmore clearly. Mesmer divined him, and ten years ago physicians\\r\\naccurately discovered the nature of his power, even before he exercised\\r\\nit himself. They played with that weapon of their new Lord, the sway of\\r\\na mysterious will over the human soul, which had become enslaved. They\\r\\ncalled it magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion ... what do I know? I have\\r\\nseen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this horrible\\r\\npower! Woe to us! Woe to man! He has come, the ... the ... what does he\\r\\ncall himself ... the ... I fancy that he is shouting out his name to me\\r\\nand I do not hear him ... the ... yes ... he is shouting it out ... I am\\r\\nlistening ... I cannot ... repeat ... it ... Horla ... I have heard ...\\r\\nthe Horla, ... it is he ... the Horla ... he has come!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! the vulture has eaten the pigeon, the wolf has eaten the lamb; the\\r\\nlion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns; man has killed the lion\\r\\nwith an arrow, with a sword, with gunpowder; but the Horla will make of\\r\\nman what we have made of the horse and of the ox: his chattel, his slave\\r\\nand his food, by the mere of his will. Woe to us!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, nevertheless, the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who\\r\\nhas subjugated it.... I should also like ... I shall be able to ... but\\r\\nI must know him, touch him, see him! Learned men say that beasts\\' eyes,\\r\\nas they differ from ours, do not distinguish like ours do.... And my eye\\r\\ncannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Oh! Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont Saint-Michel: \"Can\\r\\nwe see the hundred-thousandth part of what exists? Look here; there is\\r\\nthe wind which is the strongest force in nature, which knocks men, and\\r\\nblows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea into mountains of\\r\\nwater, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers; the wind\\r\\nwhich kills, which whistles, which sighs, which roars,--have you ever\\r\\nseen it, and can you see it? It exists for all that, however!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I went on thinking: my eyes are so weak, so imperfect, that they do\\r\\nnot even distinguish hard bodies, if they are as transparent as\\r\\nglass!... If a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way, I\\r\\nshould run into it, just like a bird which has flown into a room breaks\\r\\nits head against the windowpanes. A thousand things, moreover, deceive\\r\\nhim and lead him astray. How should it then be surprising that he cannot\\r\\nperceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new being! Why not? It was assuredly bound to come! Why should we be\\r\\nthe last? We do not distinguish it, like all the others created before\\r\\nus? The reason is, that its nature is more perfect, its body finer and\\r\\nmore finished than ours, that ours is so weak, so awkwardly conceived,\\r\\nencumbered with organs that are always tired, always on the strain like\\r\\nlocks that are too complicated, which lives like a plant and like a\\r\\nbeast, nourishing itself with difficulty on air, herbs and flesh, an\\r\\nanimal machine, which is a prey to maladies, to malformations, to decay;\\r\\nbroken-winded, badly regulated, simple and eccentric, ingeniously badly\\r\\nmade, a coarse and a delicate work, the outline of a being which might\\r\\nbecome intelligent and grand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are only a few, so few in this world, from the oyster up to man. Why\\r\\nshould there not be one more, when once that period is accomplished\\r\\nwhich separates the successive apparitions from all the different\\r\\nspecies?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not one more? Why not, also, other trees with immense, splendid\\r\\nflowers, perfuming whole regions? Why not other elements besides fire,\\r\\nair, earth and water? There are four, only four, those nursing fathers\\r\\nof various beings! What a pity! Why are they not forty, four hundred,\\r\\nfour thousand! How poor everything is, how mean and wretched! grudgingly\\r\\ngiven, dryly invented, clumsily made! Ah! the elephant and the\\r\\nhippopotamus, what grace! And the camel, what elegance!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, the butterfly you will say, a flying flower! I dream of one that\\r\\nshould be as large as a hundred worlds, with wings whose shape, beauty,\\r\\ncolors and motion I cannot even express. But I see it ... it flutters\\r\\nfrom star to star, refreshing them and perfuming them with the light and\\r\\nharmonious breath of its flight!... And the people up there look at it\\r\\nas it passes in an ecstacy of delight!...\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the matter with me? It is he, the Horla, who haunts me, and who\\r\\nmakes me think of these foolish things! He is within me, he is becoming\\r\\nmy soul; I shall kill him!\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 19._ I shall kill him. I have seen him! Yesterday I sat down at\\r\\nmy table and pretended to write very assiduously. I knew quite well that\\r\\nhe would come prowling round me, quite close to me, so close that I\\r\\nmight perhaps be able to touch him, to seize him. And then!... then I\\r\\nshould have the strength of desperation; I should have my hands, my\\r\\nknees, my chest, my forehead, my teeth to strangle him, to crush him, to\\r\\nbite him, to tear him to pieces. And I watched for him with all my\\r\\noverexcited organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece,\\r\\nas if, by this light, I could have discovered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy bed, my old oak bed with its columns was opposite to me; on my right\\r\\nwas the fireplace; on my left the door, which was carefully closed,\\r\\nafter I had left it open for some time, in order to attract him; behind\\r\\nme was a very high wardrobe with a looking-glass in it, which served me\\r\\nto dress by every day, and in which I was in the habit of looking at\\r\\nmyself from head to foot every time I passed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I pretended to be writing in order to deceive him, for he also was\\r\\nwatching me, and suddenly I felt, I was certain that he was reading over\\r\\nmy shoulder, that he was there, almost touching my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got up so quickly, with my hands extended, that I almost fell. Eh!\\r\\nwell?... It was as bright as at midday, but I did not see myself in the\\r\\nglass!... It was empty, clear, profound, full of light! But my figure\\r\\nwas not reflected in it ... and I, I was opposite to it! I saw the\\r\\nlarge, clear glass from top to bottom, and I looked at it with unsteady\\r\\neyes; and I did not dare to advance; I did not venture to make a\\r\\nmovement, nevertheless, feeling perfectly that he was there, but that he\\r\\nwould escape me again, he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow frightened I was! And then suddenly I began to see myself through a\\r\\nmist in the depths of the looking-glass, in a mist as it were through a\\r\\nsheet of water; and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing slowly\\r\\nfrom left to right, and making my figure clearer every moment. It was\\r\\nlike the end of an eclipse. Whatever it was that hid me, did not appear\\r\\nto possess any clearly defined outlines, but a sort of opaque\\r\\ntransparency, which gradually grew clearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I was able to distinguish myself completely, as I do every day\\r\\nwhen I look at myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen it! And the horror of it remained with me, and makes me\\r\\nshudder even now.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 20._ How could I kill it, as I could not get hold of it? Poison?\\r\\nBut it would see me mix it with the water; and then, would our poisons\\r\\nhave any effect on its impalpable body? No ... no ... no doubt about the\\r\\nmatter ... Then? ... then?...\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 21._ I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen, and ordered iron\\r\\nshutters of him for my room, such as some private hotels in Paris have\\r\\non the ground floor, for fear of thieves, and he is going to make me a\\r\\nsimilar door as well. I have made myself out as a coward, but I do not\\r\\ncare about that!...\\r\\n\\r\\n_September 10._ Rouen, Hotel Continental. It is done; ... it is\\r\\ndone.... But is he dead? My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, then, yesterday, the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and\\r\\ndoor, I left everything open until midnight, although it was getting\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I felt that he was there, and joy, mad joy took possession of\\r\\nme. I got up softly, and I walked to the right and left for sometime, so\\r\\nthat he might not guess anything; then I took off my boots and put on my\\r\\nslippers carelessly; then I fastened the iron shutters and going back to\\r\\nthe door quickly I double-locked it with a padlock, putting the key into\\r\\nmy pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I noticed that he was moving restlessly round me, that in his\\r\\nturn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out. I nearly\\r\\nyielded, though I did not yet, but putting my back to the door, I half\\r\\nopened, just enough to allow me to go out backwards, and as I am very\\r\\ntall, my head touched the lintel. I was sure that he had not been able\\r\\nto escape, and I shut him up quite alone, quite alone. What happiness! I\\r\\nhad him fast. Then I ran downstairs; in the drawing-room, which was\\r\\nunder my bedroom, I took the two lamps and I poured all the oil onto the\\r\\ncarpet, the furniture, everywhere; then I set the fire to it and made my\\r\\nescape, after having carefully double-locked the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden, in a clump of laurel\\r\\nbushes. How long it was! how long it was! Everything was dark, silent,\\r\\nmotionless, not a breath of air and not a star, but heavy banks of\\r\\nclouds which one could not see, but which weighed, oh! so heavily on my\\r\\nsoul.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at my house and waited. How long it was! I already began to\\r\\nthink that the fire had gone out of its own accord, or that he had\\r\\nextinguished it, when one of the lower windows gave way under the\\r\\nviolence of the flames, and a long, soft, caressing sheet of red flame\\r\\nmounted up the white wall, and kissed it as high as the roof. The light\\r\\nfell onto the trees, the branches, and the leaves, and a shiver of fear\\r\\npervaded them also! The birds awoke; a dog began to howl, and it seemed\\r\\nto me as if the day were breaking! Almost immediately two other windows\\r\\nflew into fragments, and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my\\r\\nhouse was nothing but a terrible furnace. But a cry, a horrible, shrill,\\r\\nheartrending cry, a woman\\'s cry, sounded through the night, and two\\r\\ngarret windows were opened! I had forgotten the servants! I saw the\\r\\nterror-struck faces, and their frantically waving arms!...\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, overwhelmed with horror, I set off to run to the village,\\r\\nshouting: \"Help! help! fire! fire!\" I met some people who were already\\r\\ncoming onto the scene, and I went back with them to see!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the house was nothing but a horrible and a magnificent\\r\\nfuneral pile, a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country, a\\r\\nfuneral pile where men were burning, and where he was burning also, He,\\r\\nHe, my prisoner, that new Being, the new master, the Horla!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls, and a volcano of\\r\\nflames darted up to the sky. Through all the windows which opened onto\\r\\nthat furnace, I saw the flames darting, and I thought that he was there,\\r\\nin that kiln, dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead? perhaps?... His body? Was not his body, which was transparent,\\r\\nindestructible by such means as would kill ours?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he was not dead?... Perhaps time alone has power over that Invisible\\r\\nand Redoubtable Being. Why this transparent, unrecognizable body, this\\r\\nbody belonging to a spirit, if it also had to fear ills, infirmities and\\r\\npremature destruction?\\r\\n\\r\\nPremature destruction? All human terror springs from that! After man the\\r\\nHorla. After him who can die every day, at any hour, at any moment, by\\r\\nany accident, he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and\\r\\nminute, because he had touched the limits of his existence!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo ... no ... without any doubt ... he is not dead.... Then ... then ...\\r\\nI suppose I must kill myself!...',\n"," 'LOVE\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE PAGES FROM A SPORTSMAN\\'S BOOK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just read among the General News in one of the papers, a drama of\\r\\npassion. He killed her and then he killed himself, so he must have loved\\r\\nher. What matter He or She? Their love alone matters to me; and it does\\r\\nnot interest me because it moves me or astonishes me, or because it\\r\\nsoftens me or makes me think, but because it recalls to my mind a\\r\\nremembrance of my youth, a strange recollection of a hunting adventure\\r\\nwhere Love appeared to me, as the Cross appeared to the early\\r\\nChristians, in the midst of the heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born with all the instincts and the senses of primitive man,\\r\\ntempered by the arguments and the feelings of a civilized being. I am\\r\\npassionately fond of shooting, and the sight of the bleeding animal,\\r\\nwith the blood on its feathers and on my hands, affect my heart so, as\\r\\nalmost to make it stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year the cold weather set in suddenly towards the end of autumn,\\r\\nand I was invited by one of my cousins, Karl de Rauville, to go with him\\r\\nand shoot ducks on the marshes, at daybreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin, who was a jolly fellow of forty, with red hair, very stout\\r\\nand bearded, a country gentleman, an amiable semi-brute, of a happy\\r\\ndisposition and endowed with that Gallic wit which makes even mediocrity\\r\\nagreeable, lived in a house, half farmhouse, half château, situated in\\r\\na broad valley through which a river ran. The hills right and left were\\r\\ncovered with woods, old seignorial woods where magnificent trees still\\r\\nremained, and where the rarest feathered game in that part of France was\\r\\nto be found. Eagles were shot there occasionally, and birds of passage,\\r\\nthose which rarely come into our over-populated part of the country,\\r\\nalmost infallibly stopped amid these branches, which were centuries old,\\r\\nas if they knew or recognized a little corner of a forest of ancient\\r\\ntimes which had remained there to serve them as a shelter during their\\r\\nshort nocturnal halting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the valley there were large meadows watered by trenches and separated\\r\\nby hedges; then, further on the river, which up to that point had been\\r\\ncanalized, expanded into a vast marsh. That marsh, which was the best\\r\\nshooting ground which I ever saw, was my cousin\\'s chief care, who kept\\r\\nit like a park. Among the number of rushes that covered it, and made it\\r\\nliving, rustling and rough, narrow passages had been made, through which\\r\\nthe flat-bottomed boats, which were impelled and steered by poles,\\r\\npassed along silently over the dead water, brushed up against the reeds\\r\\nand made the swift fish take refuge among the weeds, and the wild fowl\\r\\ndive, whose pointed, black heads disappeared suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am passionately fond of the water; the sea, although it is too vast,\\r\\ntoo full of movement, impossible to hold, the rivers, which are so\\r\\nbeautiful, but which pass on, flee away and go, and above all the\\r\\nmarshes, where the whole unknown existence of aquatic animals\\r\\npalpitates. The marsh is an entire world to itself on earth, a different\\r\\nworld which has its own life, its settled inhabitants and its passing\\r\\ntravelers, its voices, its noises, and above all its mystery. Nothing is\\r\\nmore disturbing, nothing, more disquieting, more terrifying\\r\\noccasionally, than a fen. Why should this terror hang over these low\\r\\nplains covered with water? Is it the vague rustling of the rushes, the\\r\\nstrange Will-o\\'-the-wisps, the profound silence which envelops them on\\r\\ncalm nights, or is it the strange mists, which hang over the rushes like\\r\\na shroud; or else it is the imperceptible splashing, so slight and so\\r\\ngentle, and sometimes more terrifying than the cannons of men or the\\r\\nthunders of skies, which make these marshes resemble countries which\\r\\nnone has dreamed of, terrible countries concealing an unknown and\\r\\ndangerous secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, something else belongs to it, another mystery, more profound and\\r\\ngraver floats amid these thick mists, perhaps the mystery of the\\r\\ncreation itself! For was it not in stagnant and muddy water, amid the\\r\\nheavy humidity of moist land under the heat of the sun, that the first\\r\\ngerm of life vibrated and expanded to the day?\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived at my cousin\\'s in the evening. It was freezing hard enough to\\r\\nsplit stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, in the large room whose sideboards, walls and ceilings\\r\\nwere covered with stuffed birds, with extended wings or perched on\\r\\nbranches to which they were nailed, hawks, herons, owls, nightjars,\\r\\nbuzzards, tiercels, vultures, falcons, my cousin, who himself resembled\\r\\nsome strange animal from a cold country, dressed in a sealskin jacket,\\r\\ntold me what preparations he had made for that same night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to start at half past three in the morning, so as to arrive at\\r\\nthe place which he had chosen for our watching place at about half past\\r\\nfour. On that spot a hut had been built of lumps of ice, so as to\\r\\nshelter us somewhat from the terrible wind which precedes daybreak, that\\r\\nwind which is so cold that it tears the flesh as if with a saw, cuts it\\r\\nlike the blade of a knife and pricks it like a poisoned sting, twists it\\r\\nlike a pair of pincers, and burns it like fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin rubbed his hands: \"I have never known such a frost,\" he said;\\r\\n\"it is already twelve degrees below zero at six o\\'clock in the evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI threw myself onto my bed immediately after we had finished our meal,\\r\\nand I went to sleep by the light of a bright fire burning in the grate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o\\'clock he woke me. In my turn, I put on a sheepskin, and I\\r\\nfound my cousin Karl covered with a bearskin. After having each of us\\r\\nswallowed two cups of scalding coffee, followed by glasses of liqueur\\r\\nbrandy, we started, accompanied by a gamekeeper and our dogs, Plongeon\\r\\nand Pierrot.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first moment that I got outside, I felt chilled to the very\\r\\nmarrow. It was one of those nights on which the earth seems dead with\\r\\ncold. The frozen air becomes resisting and palpable, such pain does it\\r\\ncause; no breath of wind moves it, it is fixed and motionless; it bites,\\r\\npierces through you, dries, kills the trees, the plants, the insects,\\r\\nthe small birds themselves that fall from the branches onto the hard\\r\\nground, and become hard themselves under the grip of the cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon, which was in her last quarter and was inclining all to one\\r\\nside, seemed fainting in the midst of space, and so weak that she did\\r\\nnot seem able to take her departure, and so she remained up yonder, also\\r\\nseized and paralyzed by the severity of the weather. She shed a\\r\\ncold, mournful light over the world, that dying and wan light which she\\r\\ngives us every month, at the end of her resurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl and I went side by side, our backs bent, our hands in our pockets\\r\\nand our guns under our arms. Our boots, which were wrapped in wool, so\\r\\nthat we might be able to walk without slipping on the frozen river, made\\r\\nno sound, and I looked at the white vapor which our dogs\\' breath made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon on the edge of the marsh, and we went into one of these\\r\\nlanes of dry rushes which ran through this low forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur elbows, which touched the long, ribbonlike leaves, left a slight\\r\\nnoise behind us, and I was seized, as I had never been before, by the\\r\\npowerful singular emotion which marshes cause in me. This one was dead,\\r\\ndead from cold, since we were walking on it, in the middle of its\\r\\npopulation of dried rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, at the turn of one of the lanes, I perceived the ice-hut which\\r\\nhad been constructed to shelter us. I went in, and as we had nearly an\\r\\nhour to wait before the wandering birds would awake, I rolled myself up\\r\\nin my rug in order to try and get warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, lying on my back, I began to look at the misshapen moon, which had\\r\\nfour horns, through the vaguely transparent walls of this polar house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the frost of the frozen marshes, the cold of these walls, the cold\\r\\nfrom the firmament penetrated me so terribly, that I began to cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousin Karl became uneasy. \"So much the worse if we do not kill much\\r\\nto-day,\" he said, \"I do not want you to catch cold; we will light a\\r\\nfire.\" And he told the gamekeeper to cut some rushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made a pile in the middle of our hut, which had a hole in the middle\\r\\nof the roof to let out the smoke, and when the red flames rose up to the\\r\\nclear, crystal cloisons they began to melt, gently, imperceptibly, as if\\r\\nthese stones of ice had sweated. Karl, who had remained outside, called\\r\\nout to me: \"Come and look here!\" I went out of the hut and remained,\\r\\nstruck with astonishment. Our hut, in the shape of a cone, looked like\\r\\nan enormous diamond with a heart of fire, which had been suddenly\\r\\nplanted there in the midst of the frozen water of the marsh. And inside\\r\\nwe saw two fantastic forms, those of our dogs, who were warming\\r\\nthemselves at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a peculiar cry, a lost, a wandering cry, passed over our heads, and\\r\\nthe light from our hearth showed us the wild birds. Nothing moves one so\\r\\nmuch as the first clamor of life which one does not see, and which is\\r\\npassing through the somber air so quickly and so far off, before the\\r\\nfirst streak of the winter\\'s day appears on the horizon. It seems to me\\r\\nat this glacial hour of dawn, as if that passing cry which is carried\\r\\naway by the wings of a bird, is the sigh of a soul from the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put out the fire,\" Karl said. \"It is getting daylight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was, in fact, beginning to grow pale, and the flights of ducks\\r\\nmade long, rapid spots, which were soon obliterated, on the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stream of light burst out into the night; Karl had fired, and the two\\r\\ndogs ran forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, nearly every minute, now he, now I, aimed rapidly as soon as\\r\\nthe shadow of a flying flock appeared above the rushes. And Pierrot and\\r\\nPlongeon, out of breath but happy, retrieved the bleeding birds for us,\\r\\nwhose eyes still, occasionally, looked at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had risen, and it was a bright day with a blue sky, and we were\\r\\nthinking of taking our departure, when two birds with extended necks and\\r\\noutstretched wings, glided rapidly over our heads. I fired, and one of\\r\\nthem fell almost at my feet. It was a teal, with a silver breast, and\\r\\nthen, in the blue space above me, I heard a voice, the voice of a bird.\\r\\nIt was a short, repeated, heartrending lament; and the bird, the little\\r\\nanimal that had been spared began to turn round in the blue sky, over\\r\\nour heads, looking at its dead companion which I was holding in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl was on his knees, his gun to his shoulder watching it eagerly,\\r\\nuntil it should be within shot. \"You have killed the duck,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and the drake will not fly away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly did not fly away; he turned round over our heads\\r\\ncontinually, and continued his cries. Never have any groans of suffering\\r\\npained me so much as that desolate appeal, as that lamentable reproach\\r\\nof this poor bird which was lost in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally he took a flight under the menace of the gun which followed\\r\\nhis flight, and seemed ready to continue his flight alone, but as he\\r\\ncould not make up his mind to this, he soon returned to find his mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave her on the ground,\" Karl said to me, \"he will come within shot by\\r\\nand by.\" And he did indeed come near us, careless of danger, infatuated\\r\\nby his animals\\' love, by his affection for that other animal which I had\\r\\njust killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl fired, and it was as if somebody had cut the string which held the\\r\\nbird suspended. I saw something black descend, and I heard the noise of\\r\\na fall among the rushes. And Pierrot brought it to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put them--they were already cold--into the same bag, and I returned to\\r\\nParis the same evening.',\n"," 'THE HOLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCUTS AND WOUNDS WHICH CAUSED DEATH. That was the heading of the charge\\r\\nwhich brought Leopold Renard, upholsterer, before the Assize Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flamèche, widow of the\\r\\nvictim, and Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent, plumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, a little ugly woman,\\r\\nwho looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how Renard (Leopold) recounted the drama:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens, it is a misfortune of which I was the first victim all\\r\\nthe time, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts are their\\r\\nown commentary, Monsieur le Président. I am an honest man, a hard\\r\\nworking man, an upholsterer in the same street for the last sixteen\\r\\nyears, known, liked, respected and esteemed by all, as my neighbors have\\r\\ntestified, even the porter who is not _folâtre_ every day. I am fond of\\r\\nwork, I am fond of saving, I like honest men, and respectable pleasures.\\r\\nThat is what has ruined me, so much the worse for me; but as my will had\\r\\nnothing to do with it, I continue to respect myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every Sunday for the last five years, my wife and I have been to spend\\r\\nthe day at Passy. We get fresh air, without counting that we are fond of\\r\\nfishing. Oh! we are as fond of it as we are of small onions. Mélie\\r\\ninspired me with that passion, the jade, and she is more enthusiastic\\r\\nthan I am, the scold, seeing that all the mischief in this business is\\r\\nher fault, as you will see immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am strong and mild-tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in me.\\r\\nBut she! oh! la! la! she looks like nothing, she is short and thin; very\\r\\nwell, she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny that she has\\r\\nsome good qualities; she has some, and very important ones for a man in\\r\\nbusiness. But her character! Just ask about it in the neighborhood, and\\r\\neven the porter\\'s wife, who has just sent me about my business ... she\\r\\nwill tell you something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every day she used to find fault with my mild temper: \\'I would not put\\r\\nup with this! I would not put up with that.\\' If I had listened to her,\\r\\nMonsieur le Président, I should have had at least three bouts of\\r\\nfisticuffs a month....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Renard interrupted him: \"And for good reasons too; they laugh\\r\\nbest who laugh last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned towards her frankly: \"Oh! very well, I can charge you, since\\r\\nyou were the cause of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, facing the President again he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening, so as\\r\\nto be able to begin fishing at daybreak the next morning. It is a habit\\r\\nwhich has become a second nature with us, as the saying is. Three years\\r\\nago this summer I discovered a place, oh! such a spot! Oh! there! in the\\r\\nshade, eight feet of water at least and perhaps ten, a hole with\\r\\n_retour_ under the bank, a regular nest for fish and a paradise for the\\r\\nfisherman. I might look upon that hole as my property, Monsieur le\\r\\nPrésident, as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the\\r\\nneighborhood knew it, without making any opposition. They used to say:\\r\\n\\'That is Renard\\'s place;\\' and nobody would have gone to it, not even\\r\\nMonsieur Plumsay, who is well known, be it said without any offense, for\\r\\nboning other peoples\\' places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I returned to my place of which I felt certain, just as if I had\\r\\nowned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when I got into\\r\\n_Delila_, with my wife. _Delila_ is my Norwegian boat, which I had built\\r\\nby Fourmaise, and which is light and safe. Well, as I said, we got into\\r\\nthe boat and we were going to bait, and for baiting, there is nobody to\\r\\nbe compared with me, and they all know it. You want to know with what I\\r\\nbait? I cannot answer that question; it has nothing to do with the\\r\\naccident; I cannot answer, that is my secret. There are more than three\\r\\nhundred people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy\\r\\nand liquors, fried fish, matelotes,[16] to make me tell! But just go and\\r\\ntry whether the chub will come. Ah! they have patted my stomach to get\\r\\nat my secret, my recipe.... Only my wife knows ... and she will not tell\\r\\nit, any more than I shall!... Is not that so Mélie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the Court interrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just get to the facts as soon as you can,\" and the accused continued:\\r\\n\"I am getting to them; I am getting to them. Well, on Saturday July 8,\\r\\nwe left by the twenty-five past five train, and before dinner we went to\\r\\nground-bait as usual. The weather promised to keep fine, and I said to\\r\\nMélie: \\'All right for to-morrow!\\' And she replied: \\'It looks like it.\\'\\r\\nWe never talk more than that together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and that was\\r\\nthe cause of everything. I said to Mélie: \\'Look here Mélie, it is fine\\r\\nweather, so suppose I drink a bottle of _Casque à mèche_.\\' That is a\\r\\nlittle white wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too\\r\\nmuch of it it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a\\r\\nnightcap. Do you understand me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She replied: \\'You can do as you please, but you will be ill again, and\\r\\nI will not be able to get up to-morrow.\\' That was true, sensible and\\r\\nprudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless, I could not\\r\\nwithstand it, and I drank my bottle. It all comes from that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! It kept me awake till two o\\'clock in\\r\\nthe morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have\\r\\nheard the angel shouting at the last Judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In short, my wife woke me at six o\\'clock, and I jumped out of bed,\\r\\nhastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on\\r\\nboard _Delila_. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it\\r\\nwas already taken! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years,\\r\\nand it made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said\\r\\nto myself, \\'Confound it all! confound it!\\' And then my wife began to nag\\r\\nat me. \\'Eh! What about your _Casque à mèche_! Get along, you drunkard!\\r\\nAre you satisfied, you great fool?\\' I could say nothing, because it was\\r\\nall quite true, and so I landed all the same near the spot and tried to\\r\\nprofit by what was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch\\r\\nnothing, and go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a little thin man, in white linen coat and waistcoat, and with a\\r\\nlarge straw hat, and his wife, a fat woman who was doing embroidery, was\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When she saw us take up our position close to their place, she\\r\\nmurmured: \\'I suppose there are no other places on the river!\\' And my\\r\\nwife, who was furious, replied: \\'People who know how to behave, make\\r\\ninquiries about the habits of the neighborhood before occupying reserved\\r\\nspots.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did not want a fuss, I said to her: \\'Hold your tongue, Mélie. Let\\r\\nthem go on, let them go on; we shall see.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we had fastened _Delila_ under the willow trees, and had landed\\r\\nand were fishing side by side, Mélie and I, close to the two others; but\\r\\nhere, Monsieur, I must enter into details.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had only been there about five minutes when our male neighbor\\'s\\r\\nfloat began to go down two or three times, and then he pulled out a chub\\r\\nas thick as my thigh, rather less, perhaps, but nearly as big! My heart\\r\\nbeat, and the perspiration stood on my forehead, and Mélie said to me:\\r\\n\\'Well, you sot, did you see that?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then, Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who is fond of gudgeon\\r\\nfishing, passed in a boat, and called out to me; \\'So somebody has taken\\r\\nyour usual place, Monsieur Renard?\\' And I replied: \\'Yes, Monsieur Bru,\\r\\nthere are some people in this world who do not know the usages of common\\r\\npoliteness.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little man in linen pretended not to hear, nor his fat lump of a\\r\\nwife, either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the President interrupted him a second time: \"Take care, you are\\r\\ninsulting the widow, Madame Flamèche, who is present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard made his excuses: \"I beg your pardon, I beg pardon, my anger\\r\\ncarried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had passed when the\\r\\nlittle man caught another chub and another almost immediately, and\\r\\nanother five minutes later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The tears were in my eyes, and then I knew that Madame Renard was\\r\\nboiling with rage, for she kept on nagging at me: \\'Oh! how horrid! Don\\'t\\r\\nyou see that he is robbing you of your fish? Do you think that you will\\r\\ncatch anything? Not even a frog, nothing whatever. Why my hands are\\r\\nburning, just to think of it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I said to myself: \\'Let us wait until twelve o\\'clock. Then this\\r\\npoaching fellow will go to lunch, and I shall get my place again.\\' As\\r\\nfor me, Monsieur le Président, I lunch on the spot every Sunday; we\\r\\nbring our provisions in _Delila_. But there! At twelve o\\'clock, the\\r\\nwretch produced a fowl out of a newspaper, and while he was eating,\\r\\nactually he caught another chub!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélie and I had a morsel also, just a thumb-piece, a mere nothing, for\\r\\nour heart was not in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I took up my newspaper, to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I read\\r\\nthe _Gil Blas_ in the shade like that, by the side of the water. It is\\r\\nColumbine\\'s day, you know, Columbine who writes the articles in the _Gil\\r\\nBlas_. I generally put Madame Renard into a passion by pretending to\\r\\nknow this Columbine. It is not true, for I do not know her, and have\\r\\nnever seen her, but that does not matter; she writes very well, and\\r\\nthen she says things straight out for a woman. She suits me, and there\\r\\nare not many of her sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately, and very\\r\\nangry, and so I held my tongue, and at that moment our two witnesses who\\r\\nare present here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur Durdent appeared on the\\r\\nother side of the river. We knew each other by sight. The little man\\r\\nbegan to fish again, and he caught so many that I trembled with\\r\\nvexation, and his wife said: \\'It is an uncommonly good spot, and we will\\r\\ncome here always Desiré.\\' As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and\\r\\nMadame Renard kept repeating: \\'You are not a man; you have the blood of\\r\\na chicken in your veins;\\' and suddenly I said to her: \\'Look here, I\\r\\nwould rather go away, or I shall only be doing something foolish.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she whispered to me as if she had put a red-hot iron under my nose:\\r\\n\\'You are not a man. Now you are going to run away, and surrender your\\r\\nplace! Off you go, Bazaine!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I felt that, but yet I did not move, while the other fellow\\r\\npulled out a bream, oh! I never saw such a large one before, never! And\\r\\nthen my wife began to talk aloud, as if she were thinking, and you can\\r\\nsee her trickery. She said: \\'That is what one might call stolen fish,\\r\\nseeing that we baited the place ourselves. At any rate, they ought to\\r\\ngive us back the money we have spent on bait.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the fat woman in the cotton dress said in turn: \\'Do you mean to\\r\\ncall us thieves, Madame?\\' And they began to explain, and then they came\\r\\nto words. Oh! Lord! those creatures know some good ones. They shouted\\r\\nso loud, that our two witnesses, who were on the other bank, began to\\r\\ncall out by way of a joke: \\'Less noise over there; you will prevent your\\r\\nhusbands from fishing.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is that neither of us moved any more than if we had been two\\r\\ntree-stumps. We remained there, with our noses over the water, as if we\\r\\nhad heard nothing, but by Jove, we heard all the same. \\'You are a mere\\r\\nliar.--You are nothing better than a streetwalker.--You are only a\\r\\ntrollop.--You are a regular strumpet.\\' And so on, and so on; a sailor\\r\\ncould not have said more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, and turned round. It was the other\\r\\none, the fat woman, who had fallen onto my wife with her parasol.\\r\\n_Whack! whack_! Mélie got two of them, but she was furious, and she hits\\r\\nhard when she is in a rage, so she caught the fat woman by the hair and\\r\\nthen, _thump, thump_, and slaps in the face rained down like ripe plums.\\r\\nI should have let them go on; women among themselves; men among\\r\\nthemselves; it does not do to mix the blows, but the little man in the\\r\\nlinen jacket jumped up like a devil and was going to rush at my wife.\\r\\nAh! no, no, not that my friend! I caught the gentleman with the end of\\r\\nmy fist, and _crash, crash_, one on the nose, the other in the stomach.\\r\\nHe threw up his arms and legs and fell on his back into the river, just\\r\\ninto the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le Président, if\\r\\nI had had the time. But unfortunately the fat woman got the better of\\r\\nit, and she was drubbing Mélie terribly. I know that I ought not to have\\r\\nassisted her while the man was drinking his fill, but I never thought\\r\\nthat he would drown, and said to myself: \\'Bah, it will cool him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I therefore ran up to the women to separate them, and all I received\\r\\nwas scratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures! Well, it took me\\r\\nfive minutes, and perhaps ten to separate those two viragoes, and when I\\r\\nturned round, there was nothing more to be seen, and the water was as\\r\\nsmooth as a lake, while the others yonder kept shouting: \\'Fish him out!\\'\\r\\nand though it was all very well to say that, I cannot swim and still\\r\\nless dive!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At last the man from the dam came, and two gentlemen with boat hooks,\\r\\nbut it had taken over a quarter of an hour. He was found at the bottom\\r\\nof the hole in eight feet of water, as I have said, but he had got it,\\r\\nthe poor little man in his linen suit! There are the facts, such as I\\r\\nhave sworn to. I am innocent, on my honor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe witnesses having deposed to the same effect, the accused was\\r\\nacquitted.',\n"," 'SAVED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marquise de Rennedon came rushing in like a ball smashing a\\r\\nwindow, and she began to laugh before she spoke, to laugh until she\\r\\ncried, like she had done a month previously, when she had told her\\r\\nfriend that she had betrayed the marquis in order to have her revenge,\\r\\nand only once, because he was really too stupid and too jealous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness de Grangerie had thrown the book which she was\\r\\nreading on the sofa, and looked at Annette curiously.

I shall not require her\\r\\nfor more than three months.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man looked extremely astonished, and said: \\'Do you require a maid\\r\\nof an irreproachable character, Madame?\\' I blushed, and stammered. \\'Yes,\\r\\nof course, for honesty.\\' He continued: ... \\'And ... then ... as regards\\r\\nmorals....\\' I did not venture to reply, so I only made a sign with my\\r\\nhead, which signified: _no_. Then suddenly, I comprehended that he had a\\r\\nhorrible suspicion and losing my presence of mind, I exclaimed: \\'Oh,\\r\\nMonsieur, ... it is for my husband, in order that I may surprise\\r\\nhim....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the man began to laugh, and from his looks I gathered that I had\\r\\nregained his esteem. He even thought I was brave, and I would willingly\\r\\nhave made a bet that at that moment he was longing to shake hands with\\r\\nme. However, he said to me: \\'In a week, Madame, I shall have what you\\r\\nrequire; I will answer for my success, and you shall not pay me until I\\r\\nhave succeeded. So this is a photograph of your husband\\'s mistress?\\'\\r\\n\\'Yes, Monsieur,\\' \\'A handsome woman, and not too stout. And what scent?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not understand, and repeated: \\'What scent?\\' He smiled: \\'Yes,\\r\\nMadame, the perfume is essential to seduce a man, for it unconsciously\\r\\nbrings to his mind certain reminiscences which dispose him to action;\\r\\nthe perfume creates an obscure confusion in his mind, and disturbs and\\r\\nenervates him by recalling his pleasures to him. You must also try to\\r\\nfind out what your husband is in the habit of eating when he dines with\\r\\nhis lady, and you might give him the same dishes the day you catch him.\\r\\nOh! we have got him, Madame, we have got him.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went away delighted, for here I had lighted on a very intelligent\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three days later, I saw a tall, dark girl arrive at my house; she was\\r\\nvery handsome and her looks were modest and bold at the same time, the\\r\\npeculiar look of a female rake. She behaved very properly towards me,\\r\\nand as I did not exactly know what she was, I called her _Mademoiselle_,\\r\\nbut she said immediately: \\'Oh! pray, Madame, only call me Rose.\\' And she\\r\\nbegan to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, Rose, you know why you have come here?\\' \\'I can guess it,\\r\\nMadame.\\' \\'Very good, my girl ... and that will not ... be too much\\r\\nbother for you?\\' \\'Oh! madame, this will be the eighth divorce that I\\r\\nshall have caused; I am used to it.\\' \\'Why, that is capital. Will it take\\r\\nyou long to succeed?\\' \\'Oh! Madame, that depends entirely on Monsieur\\'s\\r\\ntemperament. When I have seen Monsieur for five minutes alone I shall\\r\\nbe able to tell you exactly.\\' \\'You will see him soon, my child, but I\\r\\nmust tell you that he is not handsome.\\' \\'That does not matter to me,\\r\\nMadame. I have already separated some very ugly ones. But I must ask\\r\\nyou, Madame, whether you have discovered his favorite perfume?\\' \\'Yes,\\r\\nRose,--verbena.\\' \\'So much the better, Madame, for I am also very fond of\\r\\nthat scent! Can you also tell me, Madame, whether Monsieur\\'s mistress\\r\\nwears silk underclothing and nightdresses?\\' \\'No, my child, cambric and\\r\\nlace.\\' \\'Oh! then she is altogether of superior station, for silk\\r\\nunderclothing is getting quite common.\\' \\'What you say is quite true!\\'\\r\\n\\'Well, Madame, I will enter your service.\\' And so, as a matter of fact,\\r\\nshe did immediately, and as if she had done nothing else all her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An hour later my husband came home. Rose did not even raise her eyes to\\r\\nhim, but he raised his eyes to her. She already smelt strongly of\\r\\nverbena, and in five minutes she left the room, and he immediately asked\\r\\nme: \\'Who is that girl?\\' \\'Why ... my new lady\\'s maid.\\' \\'Where did you\\r\\npick her up?\\' \\'Baroness de Grangerie got her for me with the best\\r\\nreferences.\\' \\'Ah! she is rather pretty!\\' \\'Do you think so?\\' \\'Why, yes\\r\\n... for a lady\\'s maid.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was delighted, for I felt that he was already biting, and that same\\r\\nevening Rose said to me: \\'I can now promise you that it will not take\\r\\nmore than a fortnight. Monsieur is very easily caught!\\' \\'Ah! you have\\r\\ntried already?\\' \\'No, Madame, he only asked what my name was ... so that\\r\\nhe might hear what my voice was like.\\' \\'Very well, my dear Rose. Get on\\r\\nas quick as you can.\\' \\'Do not be alarmed, Madame; I shall only resist\\r\\nlong enough not to make myself depreciated.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of a week my husband scarcely ever went out; I saw him\\r\\nroaming about the house the whole afternoon, and what was most\\r\\nsignificant in the matter was, that he no longer prevented me from going\\r\\nout. And I, I was out of doors nearly the whole day long, ... in order\\r\\n... in order to leave him at liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the ninth day, while Rose was undressing me, she said to me with a\\r\\ntimid air: \\'It happened this morning, Madame.\\' I was rather surprised,\\r\\nor rather overcome even, not at the part itself, but at the way in which\\r\\nshe told me, and I stammered out: \\'And ... and ... it went off well?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! yes, very well, Madame. For the last three days he has been\\r\\npressing me, but I did not wish matters to proceed too quickly. You will\\r\\ntell me when you want us to be caught, Madame.\\' \\'Yes, certainly.\\r\\nHere!... let us say Thursday.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, I shall grant nothing\\r\\nmore until then, so as to keep Monsieur on the alert.\\' \\'You are sure not\\r\\nto fail?\\' \\'Oh! quite sure, Madame. I will excite him, so as to make him\\r\\nbe there at the very moment which you may appoint.\\' \\'Let us say five\\r\\no\\'clock, then.\\' \\'Very well, Madame, and where?\\' \\'Well ... in my\\r\\nbedroom.\\' \\'Very good, Madame, in your bedroom.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will understand what I did then, my dear. I went and fetched Mamma\\r\\nand Papa first of all, and then my uncle d\\'Orvelin, the President, and\\r\\nMonsieur Raplet, the Judge, my husband\\'s friend. I had not told them\\r\\nwhat I was going to show them, but I made them all go on tiptoe as far\\r\\nas the door of my room. I waited until five o\\'clock exactly, and oh! how\\r\\nmy heart beat! I had made the porter come upstairs as well, so as to\\r\\nhave an additional witness! And then ... and then at the moment when the\\r\\nclock began to strike, I opened the door wide.... Ah! ah! ah! Here he\\r\\nwas evidently, ... it was quite evident, my dear.... Oh! what a face!...\\r\\nif you had only seen his face!... And he turned round, the idiot! Oh!\\r\\nhow funny he looked.... I laughed, I laughed.... And papa was angry and\\r\\nwanted to give my husband a beating.... And the porter, a good servant,\\r\\nhelped him to dress himself ... before us ... before us.... He buttoned\\r\\nhis braces for him ... what a joke it was!... As for Rose, she was\\r\\nperfect, absolutely perfect.... She cried ... oh! she cried very well.\\r\\nShe is an invaluable girl.... If you ever want her, don\\'t forget!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here I am.... I came immediately to tell you of the affair ...\\r\\ndirectly. I am free. Long live divorce!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she began to dance in the middle of the drawing-room, while the\\r\\nlittle baroness, who was thoughtful and vexed, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you not invite me to see it?\"',\n"," 'BELLFLOWER[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow strange those old recollections are which haunt us, without our\\r\\nbeing able to get rid of them!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so\\r\\nvividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many\\r\\nsinister things, which were either affecting or terrible, that I am\\r\\nastonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of\\r\\nMother Bellflower recurring to my mind\\'s eye, just as I knew her\\r\\nformerly, now so long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old seamstress, who came to my parents house once a week,\\r\\nevery Thursday to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those\\r\\ncountry houses called _châteaux_, and which are merely old houses with\\r\\npointed roofs, which are surrounded by three or four farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few\\r\\nhundred yards off, and lay closely round the church, a red brick church,\\r\\nwhich had become black with age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and\\r\\nseven in the morning, and went immediately into the linen-room and began\\r\\nto work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she\\r\\nhad a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard,\\r\\ngrowing in tufts, in curly bunches, which looked as if they had been\\r\\nsown by a madman over that great face of a gendarme in petticoats. She\\r\\nhad them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on\\r\\nher cheeks; and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long,\\r\\nand quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of\\r\\nmoustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe limped, but not like lame people generally do, but like a ship at\\r\\nanchor. When she planted her great, bony, swerving body on her sound\\r\\nleg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then\\r\\nsuddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss, and buried herself\\r\\nin the ground. Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she balanced herself\\r\\nat the same time, and her head, which was always covered with an\\r\\nenormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to\\r\\ntraverse the horizon from North to South and from South to North, at\\r\\neach of her movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I went into the\\r\\nlinen-room, where I found her installed at work, with a foot-warmer\\r\\nunder her feet. As soon as I arrived, she made me take the foot-warmer\\r\\nand sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large, chilly\\r\\nroom under the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told me stories, while mending the linen with her long crooked\\r\\nnimble fingers; her eyes behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had\\r\\nimpaired her sight, appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, as far as I can remember, the things which she told me and by\\r\\nwhich my childish heart was moved, the large heart of a poor woman. She\\r\\ntold me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the\\r\\ncowhouse and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet\\'s\\r\\nmill, looking at the sails turning, or about a hen\\'s egg, which had\\r\\nbeen found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand\\r\\nwhat creature had been there to lay it, or the story of Jean-Jean Pila\\'s\\r\\ndog, who had been ten leagues to bring back his master\\'s breeches, which\\r\\na tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors, after\\r\\nhe had been in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a\\r\\nmanner, that in my mind they assumed the proportions of\\r\\nnever-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the\\r\\ningenious stories invented by the poets which my mother told me in the\\r\\nevening had none of the flavor, none of the fullness nor of the vigor of\\r\\nthe peasant woman\\'s narratives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, one Thursday, when I had spent all the morning in listening to\\r\\nMother Clochette, I wanted to go up stairs to her again during the day\\r\\nafter picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm.\\r\\nI remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress lying on\\r\\nthe ground by the side of her chair, with her face to the ground and her\\r\\narms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of\\r\\nmy shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer\\r\\none, no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles\\r\\nglistened against the wall, as they had rolled away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few\\r\\nminutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred\\r\\nmy childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing-room and went\\r\\nand hid myself in a dark corner, in the depths of a great, old armchair,\\r\\nwhere I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time no doubt, for\\r\\nnight came on. Suddenly somebody came in with a lamp, without seeing me,\\r\\nhowever, and I heard my father and mother talking with the medical man,\\r\\nwhose voice I recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the causes of\\r\\nthe accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down\\r\\nand had a glass of liquor and biscuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my\\r\\nmind until I die! I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"the poor woman! She broke her leg the day of my arrival\\r\\nhere, and I had only not even had time to wash my hands after getting\\r\\noff the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad\\r\\ncase, very bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would any one\\r\\nbelieve it? I have never told her story before, and nobody except myself\\r\\nand one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the\\r\\ncountry, ever knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be less discreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then a young assistant teacher came to live in the village; he was\\r\\ngood-looking and had the bearing of a sub-officer. All the girls ran\\r\\nafter him, and he acted the disdainful, and besides that, he was very\\r\\nmuch afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who\\r\\noccasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here, and\\r\\nwho was afterwards nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled\\r\\nout the pretty young girl, who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by\\r\\nthis impregnable conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and\\r\\nhe succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the\\r\\nhay-loft behind the school, at night, after she had done her day\\'s\\r\\nsewing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left\\r\\nthe Grabu\\'s, she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to wait for her\\r\\nlover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to\\r\\nher, when the door of the hay-loft opened and the schoolmaster appeared,\\r\\nand asked: \\'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?\\' Feeling sure that\\r\\nhe would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and\\r\\nreplied stupidly: \\'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of\\r\\nhay, Monsieur Grabu.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark, and Sigisbert pushed the\\r\\nfrightened girl to the further end and said: \\'Go there and hide\\r\\nyourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: \\'Why, you are\\r\\nnot by yourself?\\' \\'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!\\' \\'But you are not, for you\\r\\nare talking.\\' \\'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.\\' \\'I will soon find out,\\'\\r\\nthe old man replied, and double-locking the door, he went down to get a\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one frequently meets, lost\\r\\nhis head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: \\'Hide\\r\\nyourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread\\r\\nfor my whole life; you will ruin my whole career.... Do hide yourself!\\'\\r\\nThey could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to\\r\\nthe window, which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly, and\\r\\nthen in a low and determined voice she said: \\'You will come and pick me\\r\\nup when he is gone,\\' and she jumped out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise, and a\\r\\nquarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his\\r\\nadventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get\\r\\nup, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to\\r\\nfetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate\\r\\ngirl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the\\r\\nbones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain, and merely\\r\\nsaid, with admirable resignation: \\'I am punished, well punished!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl\\'s friends and told them a\\r\\nmade-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed\\r\\nher, outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole\\r\\nmonth tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all! And I say that this woman was a heroine, and belonged to\\r\\nthe race of those who accomplished the grandest deeds in history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr,\\r\\na noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely\\r\\nadmire her, I should not have told you this story, which I would never\\r\\ntell anyone during her life: you understand why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor ceased; Mamma cried and Papa said some words which I did not\\r\\ncatch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the\\r\\narmchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps\\r\\nand something knocking against the side of the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were carrying away Clochette\\'s body.',\n"," 'THE MARQUIS DE FUMEROL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger de Toumeville was sitting astride a chair in the midst of his\\r\\nfriends and talking; he held a cigar in his hand, and from time to time\\r\\ntook a whiff and blew out a small cloud of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were at dinner when a letter was brought in and my father opened it.\\r\\nYou know my father, who thinks that he is king of France _ad interim_. I\\r\\ncall him Don Quixote, because for twelve years he has been running a\\r\\ntilt against the windmill of the Republic, without quite knowing whether\\r\\nit was in the name of the Bourbons or of the Orleans. At present he is\\r\\nholding the lance in the name of the Orleans alone, because there is\\r\\nnobody else but them left. In any case, he thinks himself the first\\r\\ngentleman in France, the best known, the most influential, the head of\\r\\nthe party; and as he is an irremovable senator, he thinks that the\\r\\nneighboring kings\\' thrones are very insecure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for my mother, she is my father\\'s soul, she is the soul of the\\r\\nkingdom and of religion, the right arm of God, and the scourge of\\r\\nevil-thinkers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, so a letter was brought in while we were at dinner, and my father\\r\\nopened and read it, and then he said to my mother: \\'Your brother is\\r\\ndying.\\' She grew very pale. My uncle was scarcely ever mentioned in the\\r\\nhouse, and I did not know him at all; all I knew from public talk was,\\r\\nthat he had led, and was still leading, the life of a buffoon. After\\r\\nhaving spent his fortune with an incalculable number of women, he had\\r\\nonly retained two mistresses, with whom he was living in small\\r\\napartments in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An ex-peer of France and ex-colonel of cavalry, it was said that he\\r\\nbelieved in neither God nor devil. Not believing, therefore, in a future\\r\\nlife he had abused this present life in every way, and he had become the\\r\\nliving wound of my mother\\'s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Give me that letter, Paul,\\' she said, and when she had read it, I\\r\\nasked for it in my turn. Here it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Monsieur le comte, I thinks I ought to lett you knaw that your\\r\\n     brother-law, count Fumeroll is going to dye. Perhapps you would\\r\\n     make preparations and not forgett that I told you._\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             _Your servant_,\\r\\n                                             MÉLANI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'We must think,\\' papa murmured. \\'In my position, I ought to watch over\\r\\nyour brother\\'s last moments.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma continued: \\'I will send for Abbé Poivron and ask his advice, and\\r\\nthen I will go to my brother\\'s with the abbé and Roger. Stop here Paul,\\r\\nfor you must not compromise yourself, but a woman can, and ought to do\\r\\nthese things. But for a politician in your position, it is another\\r\\nmatter. It would be a fine thing for one of your opponents to be able to\\r\\nbring one of your most laudable actions up against you.\\' \\'You are\\r\\nright,\\' my father said. \\'Do as you think best, my dear wife.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quarter of an hour later, the Abbé Poivron came into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and the situation was explained to him, analyzed and\\r\\ndiscussed in all its bearings. If the Marquis de Fumerol, one of the\\r\\ngreatest names in France, were to die without the succor of religion,\\r\\nit would assuredly be a terrible blow for the nobility in general, and\\r\\nfor the Count de Toumeville in particular, and the freethinkers would be\\r\\ntriumphant. The evilly disposed newspapers would sing songs of victory\\r\\nfor six months; my mother\\'s name would be dragged through the mire and\\r\\nbrought into the prose of Socialistic journals, and my father\\'s would be\\r\\nbespattered. It was impossible that such a thing should occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A crusade was therefore immediately decided upon, which was to be led\\r\\nby the Abbé Poivron, a little fat, clean, slightly scented priest, a\\r\\ntrue vicar of a large church in a noble and rich quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The landau was ordered and we started all three, my mother, the Curé\\r\\nand I, to administer the last sacraments to my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It had been decided first of all we should see Madame Mélani who had\\r\\nwritten the letter, and who was most likely the porter\\'s wife, or my\\r\\nuncle\\'s servant, and I got down as a scout in front of a seven-storied\\r\\nhouse and went into a dark passage, where I had great difficulty in\\r\\nfinding the porter\\'s den. He looked at me distrustfully, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame Mélani, if you please.\\' \\'Don\\'t know her!\\' \\'But I have received\\r\\na letter from her.\\' \\'That may be, but don\\'t know her. Are you asking for\\r\\nsome kept woman?\\' \\'No, a servant probably. She wrote me about a place.\\'\\r\\n\\'A servant?... a servant?... Perhaps it is the Marquis\\'s. Go and see,\\r\\nthe fifth story on the left.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as he found I was not asking for a kept woman, he became more\\r\\nfriendly and came as far as the passage with me. He was a tall, thin\\r\\nman with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic movements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I climbed up a long spiral staircase, whose balusters I did not venture\\r\\nto touch, and I gave three discreet knocks at the left-hand door on the\\r\\nfifth story. It opened immediately, and an enormous dirty woman appeared\\r\\nbefore me, who barred the entrance with her open arms which she leant\\r\\nagainst the two doorposts, and grumbled:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you want?\\' \\'Are you Madame Mélani?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'I am the Viscounte\\r\\nde Toumeville.\\' \\'Ah! All right! Come in.\\' \\'Well, the fact is my mother\\r\\nis downstairs with a priest.\\' \\'Oh! All right; go and bring them up; but\\r\\ntake care of the porter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went downstairs and came up again with my mother, who was followed by\\r\\nthe abbé, and I fancied that I heard other footsteps behind us. As soon\\r\\nas we were in the kitchen, Mélani offered us chairs, and we all four sat\\r\\ndown to deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is he very ill?\\' my mother asked. \\'Oh! yes, Madame; he will not be\\r\\nhere long.\\' \\'Does he seem disposed to receive a visit from a priest?\\'\\r\\n\\'Oh! I do not think so.\\' \\'Can I see him?\\' \\'Well ... yes ... Madame ...\\r\\nonly ... only ... those young ladies are with him.\\' \\'What young ladies?\\'\\r\\n\\'Why ... why ... his lady friends, of course.\\' \\'Oh!\\' Mamma had grown\\r\\nscarlet, and the Abbé Poivron had lowered his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The affair began to amuse me, and I said: \\'Suppose I go in first? I\\r\\nshall see how he receives me, and perhaps I shall be able to prepare his\\r\\nheart for you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother who did not suspect any trick, replied: \\'Yes, go my dear.\\'\\r\\nBut a woman\\'s voice cried out: \\'Mélani!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fat servant ran out and said: \\'What do you want, Mademoiselle\\r\\nClaire?\\' \\'The omelette, quickly.\\' \\'In a minute, Mademoiselle.\\' And\\r\\ncoming back to us, she explained this summons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'They ordered a cheese omelette at two o\\'clock as a slight collation.\\'\\r\\nAnd immediately she began to break the eggs into a salad bowl, and began\\r\\nto whip them vigorously, while I went out onto the landing and pulled\\r\\nthe bell, so as to announce my official arrival. Mélani opened the door\\r\\nto me, and made me sit down in an ante-room, while she went to tell my\\r\\nuncle, that I had come; then she came back and asked me to go in, while\\r\\nthe Abbé hid behind the door, so that he might appear at the first sign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very much surprised at seeing my uncle, for he was very\\r\\nhandsome, very solemn and very elegant, was the old rake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sitting, almost lying in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in\\r\\nblankets, with his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the\\r\\nchair, he was waiting death with Biblical dignity. His white beard fell\\r\\nonto his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled with it on\\r\\nhis cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Standing behind his armchair, as if to defend him against me, were two\\r\\nyoung women, two stout young women, who looked at me with the bold eyes\\r\\nof prostitutes. In their petticoats and morning wrappers, with bare\\r\\narms, with coal black hair twisted up onto the nape of their neck, with\\r\\nembroidered Oriental slippers which showed their ankles and silk\\r\\nstockings, they looked like the immoral figures of some symbolical\\r\\npainting, by the side of the dying man. Between the easy-chair and the\\r\\nbed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on which two plates,\\r\\ntwo glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting for the cheese\\r\\nomelette which had been ordered some time before of Mélani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle said in weak, almost breathless but clear voice: \\'Good\\r\\nmorning, my child: it is rather late in the day to come and see me; our\\r\\nacquaintance will not last long.\\' I stammered out: \\'It was not my fault,\\r\\nuncle,\\' ... and he replied: \\'No; I know that. It is your father and\\r\\nmother\\'s fault more than yours.... How are they?\\' \\'Pretty well, thank\\r\\nyou. When they heard that you were ill, they sent me to ask after you.\\'\\r\\n\\'Ah! Why did they not come themselves?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I looked up at the two girls and said gently: \\'It is not their fault if\\r\\nthey could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my father, and\\r\\nimpossible for my mother to come in here....\\' The old man did not reply,\\r\\nbut raised his hand towards mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and\\r\\nkept it in my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The door opened, Mélani came in with the omelette and put it on the\\r\\ntable, and the two girls immediately sat down in front of their plates\\r\\nand began to eat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: \\'Uncle,\\r\\nit would be a great pleasure for my mother to embrace you.\\' \\'I also ...\\'\\r\\nhe murmured, \\'should like....\\' He said no more, and I could think of\\r\\nnothing to propose to him, and nothing more was heard except the noise\\r\\nof the plates and that vague movement of eating mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now the Abbé, who was listening behind the door, seeing our\\r\\nembarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had\\r\\ncome to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at that\\r\\napparition, that at first he remained motionless; but then he opened his\\r\\nmouth as if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in a\\r\\nstrong, deep, furious voice: \\'What are you doing here?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé, who was used to difficult situations came further in the\\r\\nroom, murmuring: \\'I have come in your sister\\'s name, Monsieur le\\r\\nMarquis; she has sent me.... She would be so happy, Monsieur....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the Marquis was not listening. Raising one hand, he pointed to the\\r\\ndoor with a proud and tragic gesture, and he said angrily and gasping\\r\\nfor breath: \\'Leave this room ... go out ... robber of souls.... Go out\\r\\nfrom here, you violator of consciences.... Go out from here, you\\r\\npicklock of dying men\\'s doors!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé went backwards, and I also went to the door, beating a retreat\\r\\nwith the clergyman; and the two little women who were avenged got up,\\r\\nleaving their omelette only half eaten, and went and stood on either\\r\\nside of my uncle\\'s armchair, putting their hands on his arms to calm\\r\\nhim, and to protect him against the criminal enterprises of the Family\\r\\nand of Religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Abbé and I rejoined my mother in the kitchen, and Mélani again\\r\\noffered us chairs, \\'I knew quite well that it would not go of its own\\r\\naccord; we must try some other means, otherwise he will escape us.\\' And\\r\\nthey began deliberating afresh, my mother being of one opinion and the\\r\\nAbbé of another, while I held a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had been discussing the matter in a low voice for half an hour,\\r\\nperhaps, when a great noise of furniture being moved and of cries\\r\\nuttered by my uncle, more vehement and terrible even, than the former\\r\\nhad been, made us all four jump up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Through the doors and walls we could hear him shouting: \\'Go out ... out\\r\\n... rascals, ... humbugs, get out scoundrels ... get out ... get\\r\\nout!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mélani rushed in, but came back immediately to call me to help her, and\\r\\nI hastened in. Opposite to my uncle who was terribly excited by anger,\\r\\nalmost standing up and vociferating, two men, one behind the other,\\r\\nseemed to be waiting till he should be dead with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By his long, ridiculous coat, his long English shoes, by his manners of\\r\\na tutor out of a situation, by his high collar, white necktie and\\r\\nstraight hair, by his humble face of a priest, I immediately recognized\\r\\nthe first as a Protestant minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The second was the porter of the house, who belonged to the reformed\\r\\nreligion and had followed us, and having seen our defeat had gone to\\r\\nfetch his own priest, in hopes of a better fate. My uncle seemed mad\\r\\nwith rage! If the sight of the Catholic priest, of the priest of his\\r\\nancestors, had irritated the Marquis de Fumerol, who had become a\\r\\nfreethinker, the sight of his porter\\'s minister made him altogether\\r\\nbeside himself. I therefore took the two men by the arm and threw them\\r\\nout of the room so violently that they embraced each other twice,\\r\\nbetween the two doors which led to the staircase, and then I disappeared\\r\\nin my turn and returned to the kitchen, which was our headquarters, in\\r\\norder to take counsel with my mother and the Abbé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mélani came back in terror, sobbing out: \\'He is dying ... he is\\r\\ndying ... come immediately ... he is dying....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother rushed out. My uncle had fallen onto the ground, full length\\r\\nalong the floor, and did not move. I fancy he was already dead. My\\r\\nmother was superb at that moment! She went straight up to the two girls\\r\\nwho were kneeling by the body and trying to raise it up, and pointing to\\r\\nthe door with irresistible authority, dignity and majesty, she said:\\r\\n\\'Now it is for you to go out.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they went out without a protest, and without saying a word. I must\\r\\nadd, that I was getting ready to turn them out as unceremoniously as I\\r\\nhad done the parson and the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the Abbé Poivron administered the last sacrament to my uncle with\\r\\nall the customary prayers and remitted all his sins, while my mother\\r\\nsobbed, kneeling near her brother. Suddenly, however, she exclaimed: \\'He\\r\\nrecognized me; he pressed my hand; I am sure he recognized me!!!... and\\r\\nthat he thanked me! Oh, God, what happiness!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Mamma! If she had known or guessed to whom those thanks ought to\\r\\nhave been addressed!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They laid my uncle on his bed; he was certainly dead that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Madame,\\' Mélani said, \\'we have no sheets to bury him in; all the linen\\r\\nbelongs to those two young ladies,\\' and when I looked at the omelette\\r\\nwhich they had not finished, I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the\\r\\nsame time. There are some strange moments and some strange sensations in\\r\\nlife, occasionally!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We gave my uncle a magnificent funeral, with five speeches at the\\r\\ngrave. Baron de Croiselles, the Senator, showed in admirable terms, that\\r\\nGod always returns victorious into well-born souls which have gone\\r\\nastray for a moment. All the members of the Royalist and Catholic party\\r\\nfollowed the funeral procession with the enthusiasm of triumphers,\\r\\nspeaking of that beautiful death, after a somewhat restless life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nViscount Roger ceased speaking, and those around him laughed. Then\\r\\nsomebody said: \"Bah! That is the story of conversions _in Extremis_.\"',\n"," 'THE SIGNAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon was still asleep in her closed and\\r\\nperfumed bedroom, in her soft, low bed, between her sheets of delicate\\r\\ncambric, fine as lace and caressing as a kiss; she was sleeping alone\\r\\nand tranquil, the happy and profound sleep of divorced women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was awakened by loud voices in the little blue drawing-room, and she\\r\\nrecognized her dear friend, the little Baroness de Grangerie, who was\\r\\ndisputing with the lady\\'s maid, because the latter would not allow her\\r\\nto go into her mistress\\' room. So the little Marchioness got up, opened\\r\\nthe door, drew back the door-hangings and showed her head, nothing but\\r\\nher fair head, hidden under a cloud of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, that you have come so early?\" she asked.\\r\\n\"It is not nine o\\'clock yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little baroness who was very pale, nervous and feverish, replied: \"I\\r\\nmust speak to you. Something horrible has happened to me.\" \"Come in, my\\r\\ndear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went in, they kissed each other, and the little Marchioness got back\\r\\ninto her bed while the lady\\'s maid opened the windows to let in light\\r\\nand air, and then when she had left the room, Madame de Rennedon went\\r\\non: \"Well, tell me what it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame de Grangerie began to cry, shedding those pretty, bright tears\\r\\nwhich make woman more charming, and she stammered without wiping her\\r\\neyes, so as not to make them red: \"Oh! my dear, what has happened to me\\r\\nis abominable, abominable. I have not slept all night, not a minute; do\\r\\nyou hear, not a minute. Here, just feel my heart, how it is beating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, taking her friend\\'s hand, she put it on her breast, on that firm,\\r\\nround covering of women\\'s hearts which often suffices men, and prevents\\r\\nthem from seeking beneath. But her breast was really beating violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued: \"It happened to me yesterday during the day, at about\\r\\nfour o\\'clock ... or half-past four; I cannot say exactly. You know my\\r\\napartments, and you know that my little drawing-room, where I always\\r\\nsit, looks onto the Rue Saint-Lazare, and that I have a mania for\\r\\nsitting at the window to look at the people passing. The neighborhood of\\r\\nthe railway station is very gay; so full of motion and lively.... Well,\\r\\nthat is just what I like! So, yesterday, I was sitting in the low chair\\r\\nwhich I have placed in my window recess; the window was open and I was\\r\\nnot thinking of anything; I was breathing the fresh air. You remember\\r\\nhow fine it was yesterday!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly, I remarked that there was also a woman sitting at the window,\\r\\na woman in red; I was in mauve, you know, my pretty mauve costume. I did\\r\\nnot know the woman, a new lodger, who had been there a month, and as it\\r\\nhad been raining for a month, I had not yet seen her, but I saw\\r\\nimmediately that she was a bad girl. At first I was very much shocked\\r\\nand disgusted that she should be at the window like I was; and then, by\\r\\ndegrees, it amused me to examine her. She was resting her elbows on the\\r\\nwindow ledge, and looking at the men, and the men looked at her also,\\r\\nall or nearly all. One might have said that they were apprised\\r\\nbeforehand by some means as they got near the house, which they scented\\r\\nas dogs scent game, for they suddenly raised their heads, and exchanged\\r\\na swift look with her, a freemason\\'s look. Hers said: \\'Will you?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theirs replied: \\'I have no time,\\' or else: \\'another day;\\' or else: \\'I\\r\\nhave not got a half penny;\\' or else: \\'Will you hide yourself, you\\r\\nwretch!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine how funny it was to see her carrying on such a piece\\r\\nof work, though, after all, it is her regular business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes she shut the window suddenly, and I saw a gentleman go in.\\r\\nShe had caught him like a fisherman hooks a gudgeon. Then I looked at my\\r\\nwatch, and I found that they stopped from twelve to twenty minutes,\\r\\nnever longer. In the end she really infatuated me, the spider! And then\\r\\nthe creature is so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked myself: How does she manage to make herself understood so\\r\\nquickly, so well and so completely? Does she add a sign of the head or a\\r\\nmotion of the hands to her looks? And I took my opera-glasses to watch\\r\\nher proceedings. Oh! they were very simple: first of all a glance, then\\r\\na smile, then a slight sign with the head, which meant: \\'Are you coming\\r\\nup?\\' But it was so slight, so vague, so discreet, that it required a\\r\\ngreat deal of knack to succeed as she did. And I asked myself: \\'I wonder\\r\\nif I could do that little movement, from below upwards, which was at the\\r\\nsame time bold and pretty, as well as she does,\\' for her gesture was\\r\\nvery pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went and tried it before the looking-glass, and, my dear, I did it\\r\\nbetter than she, a great deal better! I was enchanted, and resumed my\\r\\nplace at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She caught nobody more then, poor girl, nobody. She certainly had no\\r\\nluck. It must really be very terrible to earn one\\'s bread in that way,\\r\\nterrible and amusing occasionally, for really some of these men one\\r\\nmeets in the street are rather nice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After that they all came on my side of the road and none on hers; the\\r\\nsun had turned. They came one after the other, young, old, dark, fair,\\r\\ngray, white. I saw some who looked very nice, really very nice, my dear,\\r\\nfar better than my husband or than yours, I mean than your late husband,\\r\\nas you have got a divorce. Now you can choose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said to myself! If I give them the sign, will they understand me, who\\r\\nam a respectable woman? And I was seized with a mad longing to make that\\r\\nsign to them. I had a longing, the longing of a pregnant woman ... a\\r\\nterrible longing; you know, one of those longings which one cannot\\r\\nresist! I have some like that occasionally. How stupid such things are,\\r\\ndon\\'t you think so? I believe that we woman have the souls of monkeys. I\\r\\nhave been told (and it was a physician who told me) that the brain of a\\r\\nmonkey was very like ours. Of course we must imitate some one or other.\\r\\nWe imitate our husbands, when we love them, during the first months\\r\\nafter our marriage, and then our lovers, our female friends, our\\r\\nconfessors, when they are nice. We assume their ways of thought, their\\r\\nmanners of speech, their words, their gestures, everything. It is very\\r\\nstupid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, as for me, when I am too much tempted to do a thing I always\\r\\ndo it, and so I said to myself: \\'I will try it once, on one man only,\\r\\njust to see. What can happen to me? Nothing whatever! We shall exchange\\r\\na smile and that will be all, and I shall deny it, most certainly.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I began to make my choice. I wanted someone nice, very nice, and\\r\\nsuddenly I saw a tall, fair, very good-looking fellow coming along. I\\r\\nlike fair men, as you know. I looked at him, he looked at me; I smiled,\\r\\nhe smiled; I made the movement; oh! but scarcely; he replied _yes_ with\\r\\nhis head, and there he was, my dear! He came in at the large door of the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot imagine what passed through my mind then! I thought I should\\r\\ngo mad. Oh! how frightened I was. Just think, he will speak to the\\r\\nservants! To Joseph, who is devoted to my husband! Joseph would\\r\\ncertainly think that I had known that gentleman for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could I do, just tell me? And he would ring in a moment. What\\r\\ncould I do, tell me? I thought I would go and meet him, and tell him he\\r\\nhad made a mistake, and beg him to go away. He would have pity on a\\r\\nwoman, on a poor woman: So I rushed to the door and opened it, just at\\r\\nthe moment when he was going to ring the bell, and I stammered out,\\r\\nquite stupidly: \\'Go away, Monsieur, go away; you have made a mistake, a\\r\\nterrible mistake; I took you for one of my friends whom you are very\\r\\nlike. Have pity on me, Monsieur.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he only began to laugh, my dear, and replied: \\'Good morning, my\\r\\ndear, I know all about your little story, you may be sure. You are\\r\\nmarried, and so you want forty francs instead of twenty, and you shall\\r\\nhave them, so just show the way.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he pushed me in, closed the door, and as I remained standing\\r\\nbefore him, horror-struck, he kissed me, put his arm round my waist and\\r\\nmade me go back into the drawing-room, which had remained open. Then he\\r\\nbegan to look at everything, like an auctioneer, and continued: \\'By\\r\\nJove, it is very nice in your rooms, very well. You must be very down on\\r\\nyour luck just now, to do the window business!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I began to beg him again: \\'Oh! Monsieur, go away, please go away!\\r\\nMy husband will be coming in soon, it is just his time. I swear that you\\r\\nhave made a mistake!\\' But he answered quite coolly: \\'Come, my beauty, I\\r\\nhave had enough of this nonsense, and if your husband comes in, I will\\r\\ngive him five francs to go and have a drink at the café opposite.\\' And\\r\\nthen, seeing Raoul\\'s photograph on the chimney-piece, he asked me: \\'Is\\r\\nthat your ... your husband?\\' \\'Yes, that is he.\\' \\'He looks a nice,\\r\\ndisagreeable sort of fellow. And who is this? One of your friends?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was your photograph, my dear, you know, the one in ball dress. I did\\r\\nnot know any longer what I was saying, and I stammered: \\'Yes, it is one\\r\\nof my friends.\\' \\'She is very nice; you shall introduce me to her.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just then the clock struck five, and Raoul comes home every day at half\\r\\npast! Suppose he were to come home before the other had gone, just fancy\\r\\nwhat would have happened! Then ... then ... I completely lost my head\\r\\n... altogether.... I thought ... I thought ... that ... that ... the\\r\\nbest thing would be ... to get rid ... of ... of this man ... as quickly\\r\\nas possible.... The sooner it was over ... you understand ... and ...\\r\\nand there ... as it must be done ... and I was obliged, my dear ... he\\r\\nwould not have gone away without it.... Well I ... I locked the\\r\\ndrawing-room door.... There!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness de Rennedon had begun to laugh, to laugh madly,\\r\\nwith her head buried in her pillow, so that the whole bed shook, and\\r\\nwhen she was a little calmer she asked: \"And ... and ... was he\\r\\ngood-looking?\" \"Yes.\" \"And yet you complain?\" \"But ... but ... don\\'t you\\r\\nsee, my dear, he said ... he said ... he should come again to-morrow ...\\r\\nat the same time ... and I ... I am terribly frightened.... You have no\\r\\nidea how tenacious he is and obstinate.... What can I do ... tell me ...\\r\\nwhat can I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness sat up in bed to reflect, and then she suddenly\\r\\nsaid: \"Have him arrested!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness looked stupefied, and stammered out: \"What do you\\r\\nsay? What are you thinking of? Have him arrested? Under what pretext?\"\\r\\n\"That is very simple. Go to the Commissary of Police and say that a\\r\\ngentleman has been following you about for three months; that he had the\\r\\ninsolence to go up to your apartments yesterday; that he has threatened\\r\\nyou with another visit to-morrow, and that you demand the protection of\\r\\nthe law, and they will give you two police officers, who will arrest\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, suppose he tells....\" \"They will not believe him, you\\r\\nsilly thing, if you have told your tale cleverly to the commissary, but\\r\\nthey will believe you, who are an irreproachable woman, and in\\r\\nsociety.\" \"Oh! I shall never dare to do it.\" \"You must dare, my dear, or\\r\\nyou are lost.\" \"But think that he will ... he will insult me if he is\\r\\narrested.\" \"Very well, you will have witnesses, and he will be\\r\\nsentenced.\" \"Sentenced to what?\" \"To pay damages. In such cases, one\\r\\nmust be pitiless!\" \"Ah! speaking of damages.... There is one thing that\\r\\nworries me very much ... very much indeed.... He left me two twenty\\r\\nfranc pieces on the mantelpiece.\" \"Two twenty franc pieces?\" \"Yes.\" \"No\\r\\nmore?\" \"No.\" \"That is very little. It would have humiliated me. Well?\"\\r\\n\"Well! What am I to do with that money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Marchioness hesitated for a few seconds, and then she replied\\r\\nin a serious voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear ... you must make ... you must make your husband a little\\r\\npresent with it.... That will be only fair!\"',\n"," 'THE DEVIL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was standing opposite the doctor, by the bedside of the\\r\\ndying old woman, and she, calmly resigned and quite lucid, looked at\\r\\nthem and listened to their talking. She was going to die, and she did\\r\\nnot rebel at it, for her time was over, as she was ninety-two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its\\r\\nhot flames onto the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down\\r\\nby four generations of clod-hoppers. The smell of the fields came in\\r\\nalso, driven by the sharp wind, and parched by the noontide heat. The\\r\\ngrasshoppers chirped themselves hoarse, and filled the country with\\r\\ntheir shrill noise, which was like that of the wooden crickets which are\\r\\nsold to children at fair time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor raised his voice and said: \"Honoré, you cannot leave your\\r\\nmother in this state; she may die at any moment.\" And the peasant, in\\r\\ngreat distress replied: \"But I must get in my wheat, for it has been\\r\\nlying on the ground a long time, and the weather is just right for it;\\r\\nwhat do you say about it, mother?\" And the dying old woman, still\\r\\ntormented by her Norman avariciousness, replied _yes_ with her eyes and\\r\\nher forehead, and so urged her son to get in his wheat, and to leave her\\r\\nto die alone, but the doctor got angry, and stamping his foot, he said:\\r\\n\"You are no better than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you\\r\\nto do it, do you understand? And if you must get in your wheat to-day,\\r\\ngo and fetch Rapet\\'s wife and make her look after your mother. I will\\r\\nhave it, do you understand me? And if you do not obey me, I will let you\\r\\ndie like a dog, when you are ill in your turn; do you hear me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was tormented\\r\\nby indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his fierce love of saving,\\r\\nhesitated, calculated and stammered out: \"How much does la Rapet charge\\r\\nfor attending sick people?\" \"How should I know?\" the doctor cried. \"That\\r\\ndepends upon how long she is wanted for. Settle it with her, by Jove!\\r\\nBut I want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the man made up his mind: \"I will go for her,\" he replied; \"don\\'t get\\r\\nangry, doctor.\" And the latter left, calling out as he went: \"Take care,\\r\\nyou know, for I do not joke when I am angry!\" And as soon as they were\\r\\nalone, the peasant turned to his mother and said in a resigned voice: \"I\\r\\nwill go and fetch la Rapet, as the man will have it. Don\\'t go off while\\r\\nI am away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went out in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet, who was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the dying of\\r\\nthe neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sown her customers into\\r\\nthat linen cloth from which they would emerge no more, she went and took\\r\\nup her iron to smooth the linen of the living. Wrinkled like a last\\r\\nyear\\'s apple, spiteful, envious, avaricious with a phenomenal avarice,\\r\\nbent double, as if she had been broken in half across the loins, by the\\r\\nconstant movement of the iron over the linen, one might have said that\\r\\nshe had a kind of monstrous and cynical affection for a death struggle.\\r\\nShe never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of the\\r\\nvarious kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and she related\\r\\nwith the greatest minuteness, details which were always the same, just\\r\\nlike a sportsman recounts his shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Honoré Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing the\\r\\nstarch for the collars of the village women, and he said: \"Good evening;\\r\\nI hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her head round to look at him, and said: \"Fairly well, fairly\\r\\nwell, and you?\" \"Oh! as for me, I am as well as I could wish, but my\\r\\nmother is very poorly.\" \"Your mother?\" \"Yes, my mother!\" \"What\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her?\" \"She is going to turn up her toes, that\\'s what\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with sudden\\r\\nsympathy: \"Is she as bad as all that?\" \"The doctor says she will not\\r\\nlast till morning.\" \"Then she certainly is very bad!\" Honoré hesitated,\\r\\nfor he wanted to make a few preambulatory remarks before coming to his\\r\\nproposal, but as he could hit upon nothing, he made up his mind\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much are you going to ask to stop with her till the end? You know\\r\\nthat I am not rich, and I cannot even afford to keep a servant-girl. It\\r\\nis just that which has brought my poor mother to this state, too much\\r\\nwork and fatigue! She used to work for ten, in spite of her ninety-two\\r\\nyears. You don\\'t find any made of that stuff nowadays!...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet answered gravely: \"There are two prices: Forty sous by day and\\r\\nthree francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by day, and forty by\\r\\nnight for the others. You shall pay me the twenty and forty.\" But the\\r\\npeasant reflected, for he knew his mother well. He knew how tenacious of\\r\\nlife, vigorous and unyielding she was, and she might last another week,\\r\\nin spite of the doctor\\'s opinion, and so he said resolutely: \"No, I\\r\\nwould rather you would fix a price until the end. I will take my chance,\\r\\none way or the other. The doctor says she will die very soon. If that\\r\\nhappens so much the better for you, and so much the worse for me, but if\\r\\nshe holds out till to-morrow or longer, so much the better for me and so\\r\\nmuch the worse for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a\\r\\ndeath as a speculative job, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of\\r\\nthe possible gain, but almost immediately she suspected that he wanted\\r\\nto juggle her, \"I can say nothing until I have seen your mother,\" she\\r\\nreplied. \"Then come with me and see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe washed her hands, and went with him immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps,\\r\\nwhile he strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at\\r\\nevery step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their\\r\\nheads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them\\r\\nfor some green grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got near the house, Honoré Bontemps murmured: \"Suppose it is\\r\\nall over?\" And the unconscious wish which he had that it might be so,\\r\\nshowed itself in the sound of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her\\r\\nwretched bed, her hands covered with a pink cotton counterpane, horribly\\r\\nthin, knotty hands, like strange animals, like crabs, and closed by\\r\\nrheumatism, fatigue, and the work of nearly a century which she had\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt her\\r\\npulse, tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing, and asked her\\r\\nquestions, so as to hear her speak: and then, having looked at her for\\r\\nsome time longer, she went out of the room, followed by Honoré. Her\\r\\ndecided opinion was that the old woman would not last out the night, and\\r\\nhe asked: \"Well?\" And the sick-nurse replied: \"Well, she may last two\\r\\ndays, perhaps three. You will have to give me six francs, everything\\r\\nincluded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six francs! six francs!\" he shouted. \"Are you out of your mind? I tell\\r\\nyou that she cannot last more than five or six hours!\" And they disputed\\r\\nangrily for some time, but as the nurse said she would go home, as the\\r\\ntime was going by, and as his wheat would not come to the farmyard of\\r\\nits own accord, he agreed to her terms at last:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well then, that is settled; six francs including everything, until\\r\\nthe corpse is taken out.\" \"That is settled, six francs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went away, with long strides, to his wheat, which was lying on\\r\\nthe ground under the hot sun, which ripens the grain, while the\\r\\nsick-nurse returned to the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had brought some work with her, for she worked without stopping by\\r\\nthe side of the dead and the dying, sometimes for herself, sometimes for\\r\\nthe family which employed her as seamstress also, paying her rather\\r\\nmore in that capacity. Suddenly she asked: \"Have you received the last\\r\\nsacraments, Mother Bontemps?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old peasant woman said \"no\" with her head, and la Rapet, who was\\r\\nvery devout, got up quickly: \"Good heavens, is it possible? I will go\\r\\nand fetch the Curé;\" and she rushed off to the parsonage so quickly,\\r\\nthat the urchins in the street thought some accident had happened, when\\r\\nthey saw her trotting off like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a choir-boy,\\r\\nwho rang a bell, to announce the passage of the Host through the parched\\r\\nand quiet country. Some men, who were working at a distance, took off\\r\\ntheir large hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had\\r\\ndisappeared behind some farm buildings; the women who were making up the\\r\\nsheaves, stood up to make the sign of the cross; the frightened black\\r\\nhens ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole\\r\\nthrough which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal, which was tied up\\r\\nin a meadow, took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to turn\\r\\nround at the length of its rope, kicking violently. The choir-boy, in\\r\\nhis red cassock, walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined\\r\\ntowards one shoulder, and with his square biretta on his head, followed\\r\\nhim, muttering some prayers, and last of all came la Rapet, bent almost\\r\\ndouble, as if she wished to prostrate herself as she walked with folded\\r\\nhands, as if she were in church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonoré saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: \"Where is our priest\\r\\ngoing to?\" And his man, who was more acute, replied: \"He is taking the\\r\\nsacrament to your mother, of course!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant was not surprised, and said: \"That is quite possible,\" and\\r\\nwent on with his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and communion, and the\\r\\npriest took his departure, leaving the two women alone in the\\r\\nsuffocating cottage, while la Rapet began to look at the dying woman,\\r\\nand to ask herself whether it could last much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was on the wane, and a cooler air came in stronger puffs, and\\r\\nmade a view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two pins, flap\\r\\nup and down, the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white,\\r\\nbut were now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were\\r\\ngoing to fly off and seemed to struggle to get away, like the old\\r\\nwoman\\'s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lying motionless, with her eyes open, seemed to await that death\\r\\nwhich was so near and which yet delayed its coming, with perfect\\r\\nindifference. Her short breath whistled in her tightening throat. It\\r\\nwould stop altogether soon, and there would be one woman less in the\\r\\nworld, whom nobody would regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nightfall Honoré returned, and when he went up to the bed and saw\\r\\nthat his mother was still alive, he asked: \"How is she?\" just as he had\\r\\ndone formerly, when she had been unwell, and then he sent la Rapet away,\\r\\nsaying to her: \"To-morrow morning at five o\\'clock, without fail.\" And\\r\\nshe replied: \"To-morrow, at five o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came at daybreak, and found Honoré eating his soup, which he had\\r\\nmade himself, before going to work, and the sick-nurse asked him: \"Well,\\r\\nis your mother dead?\" \"She is rather better, on the contrary,\" he\\r\\nreplied, with a malignant look out of the corner of his eyes. And he\\r\\nwent out.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was seized with anxiety, and went up to the dying woman, who\\r\\nremained in the same state, lethargic and impassive, with her eyes open\\r\\nand her hands clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that this\\r\\nmight go on thus for two days, four days, eight days, and her avaricious\\r\\nmind was seized with fear, while she was excited to furious rage against\\r\\nthe cunning fellow who had tricked her, and against the woman, who would\\r\\nnot die.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she began to work and waited with her looks fixed on the\\r\\nwrinkled face of Mother Bontemps, and when Honoré returned to breakfast\\r\\nhe seemed quite satisfied and even in a bantering humor, for he was\\r\\ndecidedly carrying in his wheat under very favorable circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Rapet was getting exasperated; every minute passed now seemed to her\\r\\nso much time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad inclination to\\r\\ntake this old ass, this headstrong old fool, this obstinate old wretch,\\r\\nand to stop that short, rapid breath, which was robbing her of her time\\r\\nand money, by squeezing her throat a little. But then, she reflected on\\r\\nthe danger of doing so, and other thoughts came into her head, so she\\r\\nwent up to the bed and said to her: \"Have you ever seen the Devil?\"\\r\\nMother Bontemps whispered: \"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales which were\\r\\nlikely to terrify her weak and dying mind. Some minutes before one died\\r\\nthe Devil appeared, she said, to all who were in their death throes. He\\r\\nhad a broom in his hand, a saucepan on his head, and he uttered loud\\r\\ncries. When anybody had seen him, all was over, and that person had only\\r\\na few moments longer to live; and she enumerated all those to whom the\\r\\nDevil had appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie Ratier, Sophie\\r\\nPadagnau, Séraphine Grospied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Bontemps, who was at last most disturbed in mind, moved about,\\r\\nwrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look at the bottom of the\\r\\nroom, and suddenly la Rapet disappeared at the foot of the bed. She took\\r\\na sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped herself up in it; she put the\\r\\niron pot onto her head, so that its three short bent feet rose up like\\r\\nhorns, and she took a broom in her right hand and a tin pail in her\\r\\nleft, which she threw up suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground\\r\\nnoisily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd certainly when it came down, it made a terrible noise; then,\\r\\nclimbing onto a chair, the nurse lifted up the curtain which hung at the\\r\\nbottom of the bed, and showed herself, gesticulating and uttering shrill\\r\\ncries into the pot which covered her face, while she menaced the old\\r\\npeasant woman, who was nearly dead, with her broom.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, with a mad look on her face, the dying woman made a\\r\\nsuperhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her shoulders and\\r\\nchest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep sigh. All was over, and\\r\\nla Rapet calmly put everything back into its place; the broom into the\\r\\ncorner by the cupboard, the sheet inside it, the pot on the hearth, the\\r\\npail on the floor and the chair against the wall. Then, with\\r\\nprofessional movements, she closed the dead woman\\'s enormous eyes, put\\r\\na plate on the bed and poured some holy water into it, dipped the twig\\r\\nof boxwood into it, and kneeling down, she fervently repeated the\\r\\nprayers for the dead, which she knew by heart, as a matter of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Honoré returned in the evening, he found her praying, and he\\r\\ncalculated immediately that she had made twenty sous out of him, for she\\r\\nhad only spent three days and one night there, which made five francs\\r\\naltogether, instead of the six which he owed her.',\n"," 'EPIPHANY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Captain Count de Garens, \"I should rather think that I do\\r\\nremember it, that supper of the Kings, during the war!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was at the time quarter-master of cavalry, and for a fortnight had\\r\\nbeen lurking about as a scout in front of the German advanced guard. The\\r\\nevening before we had cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one\\r\\nof whom was that poor little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de\\r\\nRaudeville well, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, on that day my captain ordered me to take six troopers and to go\\r\\nand occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five fights in\\r\\nthree weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty houses left\\r\\nstanding, not a dozen houses in that wasp\\'s nest. So I took ten\\r\\ntroopers, and set out at about four o\\'clock and at five o\\'clock, while\\r\\nit was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I\\r\\nhalted and ordered Marchas, you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterwards\\r\\nmarried little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de\\r\\nMartel-Auvelin, to go alone into the village, and to report to me what\\r\\nhe saw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had chosen nothing but volunteers, and all of good family. It is\\r\\npleasant when on service not to be forced to be on intimate terms with\\r\\nunpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as sharp as possible, as cunning as\\r\\na fox and as supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as well\\r\\nas a dog can scent a hare, could find victuals where we should have\\r\\ndied of hunger without him, and he obtained information from everybody,\\r\\nand information which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In ten minutes he returned. \\'All right,\\' he said; \\'there have been no\\r\\nPrussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is this village.\\r\\nI have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is attending to four or\\r\\nfive wounded men in an abandoned convent.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ordered them to ride on, and we penetrated into the principal street.\\r\\nOn the right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were\\r\\nhardly visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was\\r\\nburning in a room; some family had remained to keep its house standing\\r\\nas much as they were able; a family of brave, or of poor, people. The\\r\\nrain had begun to fall, a fine, icy cold rain, which froze us before it\\r\\nwetted us through, by merely touching our cloaks. The horses stumbled\\r\\nagainst stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided us,\\r\\ngoing before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where are you taking us to?\\' I asked him. And he replied: \\'I have a\\r\\nplace for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.\\' And soon we stopped\\r\\nbefore a small house, evidently belonging to some owner of the middle\\r\\nclasses, quite enclosed, built near the street and with a garden in the\\r\\nrear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marchas broke open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up\\r\\nnear the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front\\r\\ndoor with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was\\r\\nnever without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of\\r\\nsome rich private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as\\r\\nif he had lived in this house which he now saw for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to stout Ponderel, who followed him: \\'The stables must be on the\\r\\nleft; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we\\r\\ndo not want them,\\' and then turning to me he said: \\'Give your orders,\\r\\nconfound it all!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: \\'I shall\\r\\npost my sentinels at the country approaches and I will return to you\\r\\nhere?\\' \\'How many man men are you going to take?\\' \\'Five. The others will\\r\\nrelieve them at five o\\'clock in the evening.\\' \\'Very well. Leave me four\\r\\nto look after provisions, to do the cooking and to set the table. I will\\r\\ngo and find out where the wine is hidden away.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went off, to reconnoiter the deserted streets, until they ended in\\r\\nthe open country, so as to post my sentries there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Half an hour later I was back, and I found Marchas lounging in a great\\r\\narmchair, the covering of which he had taking off, from love of luxury\\r\\nas he said. He was warming his feet at the fire, and smoking an\\r\\nexcellent cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows\\r\\nresting on the arms of the chair, his shoulders, his cheeks flushed, his\\r\\neyes bright, and looking delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas\\r\\nsaid to me, smiling in a beatific manner: \\'This is famous; I found the\\r\\nchampagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy--fifty bottles\\r\\nof the very finest--in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which did\\r\\nnot look to me to be quite straight, when I looked at it by the light\\r\\nof my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck and\\r\\nthree pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful\\r\\npart of the country.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had sat down opposite to him, and the fire in the grate was burning\\r\\nmy nose and cheeks. \\'Where did you find this wood?\\' I asked. \\'Splendid\\r\\nwood,\\' he replied. \\'The owner\\'s carriage. It is the paint which is\\r\\ncausing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A capital\\r\\nhouse!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I laughed for I found the creature was funny, and he went on: \\'Fancy\\r\\nthis being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose, but there\\r\\nis no queen; it is really very annoying!\\' And I repeated like an echo:\\r\\n\\'It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the matter?\\' \\'To find\\r\\nsome, of course. Some women,\\' \\'Women?... you must be mad?\\' \\'I managed to\\r\\nfind the brandy under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps;\\r\\nand yet there was nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is\\r\\na sure sign. Go and look, old fellow.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was\\r\\njoking or not, and so I replied: \\'Look here, Marchas, are you having a\\r\\njoke with me?\\' \\'I never joke on duty.\\' \\'But where the devil do you\\r\\nexpect me to find any women?\\' \\'Where you like, there must be two or\\r\\nthree remaining in the neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them\\r\\nhere.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas went on:\\r\\n\\'Do you want an idea?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'Go and see the priest.\\' \\'The priest? What\\r\\nfor?\\' \\'Ask him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.\\' \\'The\\r\\npriest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity; \\'I am not laughing,\\r\\ngo and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as his\\r\\nmust be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one woman\\r\\nat least, a lady, of course, since we are all men of the world. He is\\r\\nsure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if\\r\\nthere is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will indicate her to\\r\\nyou.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?\\' \\'My dear Garens, you\\r\\ncan do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We are well bred, by\\r\\njove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners and our grandest\\r\\nstyle. Tell the Abbé who we are, make him laugh, soften him, seduce him\\r\\nand persuade him!\\' \\'No, it is impossible.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my weak side, the scamp\\r\\ncontinued: \\'Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to do, and how\\r\\namusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and it will\\r\\ngive you a famous reputation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and so he persisted:\\r\\n\\'Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and you\\r\\nalone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood. I\\r\\nbeg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war, I will relate\\r\\nthe whole affair in verse in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. You owe this\\r\\nmuch to your men, for you have made them march enough during the last\\r\\nmonth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got up at last and asked: \\'Where is the parsonage?\\' \\'Take the second\\r\\nturning at the end of the street, you will see an avenue, and at the end\\r\\nof the avenue you will find the church. The parsonage is beside it.\\' As\\r\\nI went out, he called out: \\'Tell him the bill of fare, to make him\\r\\nhungry!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I discovered the ecclesiastic\\'s little house without any difficulty; it\\r\\nwas by the side of a large, ugly, brick church. I knocked at the door\\r\\nwith my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice\\r\\nfrom inside asked: \\'Who is there?\\' To which I replied: \\'A quarter-master\\r\\nof the hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and I found\\r\\nmyself face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest\\r\\nof a prize-fighter, formidable hands projecting from turned up sleeves,\\r\\na red face and the looks of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and\\r\\nsaid: \\'Good day, Monsieur le Curé.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had feared a surprise, some marauders\\' ambush, and he smiled as he\\r\\nreplied: \\'Good day, my friend; come in.\\' I followed him into a small\\r\\nroom with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very\\r\\ndifferent to Marchas\\' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: \\'What\\r\\ncan I do for you?\\' \\'Monsieur, allow me first of all to introduce\\r\\nmyself;\\' and I gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: _The\\r\\nComte de Garens_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I continued: \\'There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l\\'Abbé, five on\\r\\ngrand guard, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant.\\r\\nThe names of the six are, Garens, (that is I), Pierre de Marchas,\\r\\nLudovic de Ponderel, Baron d\\'Etreillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter\\'s\\r\\nson and Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in\\r\\ntheir name and my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an\\r\\nEpiphany supper, Monsieur le Curé, and we should like to make it a\\r\\nlittle cheerful.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest smiled and murmured: \\'It seems to me to be hardly a suitable\\r\\noccasion for amusing oneself.\\' And I replied: \\'We are fighting every\\r\\nday, Monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been killed in a month, and\\r\\nthree fell, as late as yesterday. That is war. We stake our lives every\\r\\nmoment, have we not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves freely? We\\r\\nare Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere. Our\\r\\nfathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to brighten\\r\\nourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like soldiers; you\\r\\nunderstand me, I hope. Are we wrong?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He replied quickly: \\'You are quite right, my friend, and I accept your\\r\\ninvitation with great pleasure.\\' Then he called out: \\'Hermance!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An old bent, wrinkled, horrible, peasant woman appeared and said: \\'What\\r\\ndo you want?\\' \\'I shall not dine at home, my daughter.\\' \\'Where are you\\r\\ngoing to dine then?\\' \\'With some gentlemen, hussars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt inclined to say: \\'Bring your servant with you, just to see\\r\\nMarchas\\'s face,\\' but I did not venture to, but continued: \\'Do you know\\r\\nanyone among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite as\\r\\nwell?\\' He hesitated, reflected, and then said: \\'No, I do not know\\r\\nanybody!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I persisted: \\'Nobody! Come, Monsieur, think; It would be very nice to\\r\\nhave some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing\\r\\nabout your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the ... the\\r\\n... the ... watchmaker ... the ... shoemaker ... the ... the chemist\\r\\nwith Mrs. chemist.... We have a good spread, and plenty of wine, and we\\r\\nshould be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves behind\\r\\nus, with the people here.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The priest thought again for a long time, and then resolutely: \\'No,\\r\\nthere is nobody.\\' I began to laugh. \\'By Jove, Monsieur le Curé, it is\\r\\nvery vexing not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come,\\r\\nthink. Is there not a married Mayor, or a married Deputy-Mayor, or a\\r\\nmarried Municipal Concilor or schoolmaster?\\' \\'No, all the ladies have\\r\\ngone away.\\' \\'What, is there not in the whole place some good tradesman\\'s\\r\\nwife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this pleasure, for\\r\\nit would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure under present\\r\\ncircumstances?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suddenly the Curé began to laugh, and he laughed so violently that\\r\\nhe fairly shook. And exclaimed: \\'Ha! ha! ha! I have got what you want,\\r\\nyes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and enjoy\\r\\nourselves, my children, we will have some fun. How pleased the ladies\\r\\nwill be, I say, how delighted they will be. Ha! ha!... Where are you\\r\\nstaying?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I described the house, and he understood where it was. \\'Very good,\\' he\\r\\nsaid. \\'It belongs to Monsieur Bertin Lavaille. I will be there in half\\r\\nan hour, with four ladies!!!... Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!!!...\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating; \\'That is\\r\\ncapital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille\\'s house.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. \\'Covers\\r\\nfor how many?\\' Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. \\'Eleven. There are\\r\\nsix of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.\\' He was\\r\\nthunderstruck, and I triumphant, and he repeated: \\'Four ladies! Did you\\r\\nsay, four ladies?\\' \\'I said: four women.\\' \\'Real women?\\' \\'Real women.\\'\\r\\n\\'Well accept my compliments!\\' \\'I will, for I deserve them.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He got out of his armchair, opened the door and I saw a beautiful,\\r\\nwhite tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue\\r\\naprons were setting out the plates and glasses. \\'There are some women\\r\\ncoming!\\' Marchas cried. And three men began to dance and to cheer with\\r\\nall their might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an\\r\\nhour, while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house.\\r\\nAt last, however, a knock against the shutters, made us all jump up at\\r\\nthe same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a\\r\\nminute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,\\r\\nwrinkled and timid, and successively saluted the four bewildered hussars\\r\\nwho saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled\\r\\nfloor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other\\r\\none by one, who came in balancing themselves with different movements,\\r\\none canting to the right, while the other canted to the left. And three\\r\\nworthy women showed themselves, limping, dragging their legs behind\\r\\nthem, crippled by illness and deformed through old age, three infirm old\\r\\nwomen, past service, the only three pensioners in the establishment\\r\\nwhich Sister Saint-Benedict managed, who were able to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and\\r\\nthen seeing my quarter-master\\'s stripes, she said to me: \\'I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little\\r\\npleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat\\r\\nand doing them a great honor.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw the priest, who had remained in the obscurity of the passage, and\\r\\nwho was laughing heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially\\r\\nwhen I saw Marchas\\'s face. Then motioning the nun to the seats I said:\\r\\n\\'Sit down, Sister: we are very proud and very happy that you have\\r\\naccepted our unpretentious invitation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the\\r\\nfire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their\\r\\nsticks and shawls which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the\\r\\nfirst, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently\\r\\nsuffering from the dropsy, she said: \\'This is Mother Paumelle, whose\\r\\nhusband was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa;\\r\\nshe is sixty years old.\\' Then she pointed to another, a tall woman,\\r\\nwhose head trembled unceasingly: \\'This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is\\r\\nsixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a\\r\\nfire, and her right leg was half burnt off.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,\\r\\nstupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions. \\'This is la\\r\\nPutois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bowed to the three women as if I were presented to some Royal\\r\\nHighness, and turning to the priest I said: \\'You are an excellent man\\r\\nMonsieur l\\'Abbé, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious and\\r\\njust then Karl Massouligny cried: \\'Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is on\\r\\nthe table!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,\\r\\nwhose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy\\r\\ntask, for her swollen stomach seemed heavier than a lump of iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stout Ponderel gave her arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her\\r\\ncrutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, la Putois to the\\r\\ndining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as we were opposite our plates, the Sister clapped her hands\\r\\nthree times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the\\r\\nwomen made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly\\r\\nrepeated the _Benedictus_ in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls\\r\\nappeared, brought in by Marchas, who chose to wait on them, as to sit\\r\\ndown as a guest, to this ridiculous repast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I cried: \\'Bring the champagne at once!\\' and a cork flew out with\\r\\nthe noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the priest and\\r\\nthe kind Sister, the three hussars sitting by the side of the three\\r\\ninvalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats, by force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and\\r\\non being on good terms with everyone, wherever he was, made love to\\r\\nMother Paumelle, in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had\\r\\nretained her cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him\\r\\nbanteringly in a high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put\\r\\non, and she laughed so heartily at her neighbor\\'s jokes, that her large\\r\\nstomach looked as if it were going to rise up and get onto the table.\\r\\nLittle Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot\\r\\ndrunk, and Baron d\\'Etreillis whose wits were not always particularly\\r\\nsharp, was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the\\r\\nrules in the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The nun said to Massouligny in consternation: \\'Oh! oh! you will make\\r\\nher ill; pray do not make her laugh like that, Monsieur. Oh!\\r\\nMonsieur....\\' Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take a full glass\\r\\nout of his hands which he was hastily emptying down la Putois\\' throat,\\r\\nwhile the priest shook with laughter, and said to the Sister: \\'Never\\r\\nmind, just this once, it will not hurt her. Do leave them alone.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three\\r\\npigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,\\r\\ngolden-colored, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned fat meat. La\\r\\nPaumelle who was getting lively, clapped her hands; la Jean-Jean left\\r\\noff answering the Baron\\'s numerous questions, and la Putois uttered\\r\\ngrunts of pleasure, half cries and half sighs, like little children do\\r\\nwhen one shows them sweets. \\'Allow me to take charge of this animal,\\'\\r\\nthe _Curé_ said. \\'I understand these sort of operations better than most\\r\\npeople.\\' \\'Certainly, Monsieur l\\'Abbé,\\' and the Sister said: \\'How would\\r\\nit be to open the window a little; they are too warm, and I am afraid\\r\\nthey will be ill.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I turned to Marchas: \\'Open the window for a minute.\\' He did so, the\\r\\ncold outer air as it came in, made the candles flare, and the smoke\\r\\nfrom the goose, which the _Curé_ was scientifically carving, with a\\r\\ntable napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it,\\r\\nwithout speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive\\r\\nhandiwork, and seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that\\r\\nenormous golden-colored bird, whose limbs fell one after another into\\r\\nthe brown gravy at the bottom of the dish. And at that moment, in the\\r\\nmidst of that greedy silence which kept us all attentive, the distant\\r\\nreport of a shot came in at the open window.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started to my feet so quickly, that my chair fell down behind me, and\\r\\nI shouted: \\'Mount, all of you! You, Marchas, will take two men and go\\r\\nand see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.\\' And\\r\\nwhile the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I got\\r\\ninto the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps\\r\\nof the villa, while the _Curé_, the Sister and the three old women\\r\\nshowed their frightened faces at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The\\r\\nrain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop\\r\\nof a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called\\r\\nout to him: \\'Well?\\' \\'It is nothing; François has wounded an old peasant\\r\\nwho refused to answer his challenge: \"Who goes there?\" and who continued\\r\\nto advance, in spite of the order to keep off; but they are bringing him\\r\\nhere, and we shall see what is the matter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I gave orders for the horses to be put back into the stable, and I sent\\r\\nmy two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the\\r\\n_Curé_, Marchas and I took a mattress into the room to put the wounded\\r\\nman on; the Sister tore up a table napkin, in order to make lint, while\\r\\nthe three frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to\\r\\nshow a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared,\\r\\ncarrying that inert, soft, long and sinister object which a human body\\r\\nbecomes when life no longer sustains it.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for\\r\\nhim, and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death\\r\\nrattle and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his\\r\\nmouth, forced out of his mouth by his gasps. The man was covered with\\r\\nit! His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to\\r\\nhave been rubbed, to have been dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck\\r\\nto him, and had become a dull color, which was horrible to look at.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old man, wrapped up in a large shepherd\\'s cloak, occasionally\\r\\nopened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment,\\r\\nlike those of animals which a sportsman kills, and which fall at his\\r\\nfeet, more than half dead already, stupefied with fear and astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ exclaimed: \\'Ah! there is old Placide, the shepherd, from les\\r\\nMarlins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh God! they have\\r\\nkilled the unhappy man!\\' The Sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and\\r\\nwas looking at a little blue hole in the middle of his chest, which was\\r\\nnot bleeding any more. \\'There is nothing to be done,\\' she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last\\r\\nbreath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could\\r\\nhear an ominous and continued gurgling. The Curé, standing in front of\\r\\nhim, raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow\\r\\nand solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men\\'s souls,\\r\\nbut before they were finished the old man was shaken by a rapid shock,\\r\\nas if something had broken inside him; he no longer breathed. He was\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than\\r\\nthe death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were\\r\\nstanding up huddled close together; hideous, and grimacing with fear and\\r\\nhorror. I went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while\\r\\nla Jean-Jean, whose leg had been burnt, and could not longer support\\r\\nher, fell to the ground at full length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old\\r\\nwomen, and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round\\r\\nthem, gave them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go\\r\\nout, and disappeared with them into the dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere\\r\\nrattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Curé_ was still looking at the dead man; but at last he turned\\r\\nround to me and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh! What a horrible thing!\\'\"',\n"," 'IN THE WOOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was just going to sit down to breakfast, when he was told that\\r\\nthe rural policeman was waiting for him at the Mansion-house with two\\r\\nprisoners, and he went there immediately, and found old Hochedur\\r\\nstanding up and watching a middle-class couple of mature years, with a\\r\\nsevere look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, a fat old fellow with a red nose and white hair, seemed utterly\\r\\ndejected; while the woman, a little roundabout, fat woman, with shining\\r\\ncheeks, looked at the agent of the authorities who had arrested them,\\r\\nwith defiant eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it? What is it? Hochedur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rural policeman made his deposition: He had gone out that morning at\\r\\nhis usual time, in order to go on his beat from the forest of Champioux\\r\\nas far as the boundaries of Argenteuil. He had not noticed anything\\r\\nunusual in the country except that it was a fine day, and that the wheat\\r\\nwas doing well, when the son of old Bredel, who was going over his vines\\r\\na second time, called out to him: \"Here, Daddy Hochedur, go and have a\\r\\nlook into the skirts of the wood, in the first thicket, and you will\\r\\ncatch a pair of pigeons there that must be a hundred and thirty years\\r\\nold between them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went in the direction that had been indicated to him, and had gone\\r\\ninto the thicket, and there he heard words and gasps, which made him\\r\\nsuspect a flagrant breach of morality. Advancing, therefore, on his\\r\\nhands and knees, as if to surprise a poacher, he had arrested the couple\\r\\nwho were there present, at the very moment when they were going to\\r\\nabandon themselves to their natural instincts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor looked at the culprits in astonishment, for the man was\\r\\ncertainly sixty, and the woman fifty-five at least, and so he began to\\r\\nquestion them, beginning with the man, who replied in such a weak voice\\r\\nthat he could scarcely be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\" \"Nicolas Beaurain.\" \"Your occupation?\"\\r\\n\"Haberdasher, in the Rue des Martyrs, in Paris.\" \"What were you doing in\\r\\nthe wood?\" The haberdasher remained silent, with his eyes on his fat\\r\\nstomach; and his hand resting on his thighs, and the Mayor continued:\\r\\n\"Do you deny what the officer of the municipal authorities states?\" \"No,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"So you confess it?\" \"Yes, Monsieur.\" \"What have you to say\\r\\nin your defense?\" \"Nothing, Monsieur.\" \"Where did you meet the partner\\r\\nin your misdemeanor?\" \"She is my wife, Monsieur.\" \"Your wife?\" \"Yes,\\r\\nMonsieur.\" \"Then ... then ... you do not live together ... in Paris?\" \"I\\r\\nbeg your pardon, Monsieur, but we are living together!\" \"But in that\\r\\ncase ... you must be mad, altogether mad, my dear sir, to get caught\\r\\nlike that, in the country at ten o\\'clock in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe haberdasher seemed ready to cry with shame, and he murmured: \"It was\\r\\nshe who enticed me! I told her it was very stupid, but when a woman has\\r\\ngot a thing into her head ... you know ... you cannot get it out of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor, who liked open speaking, smiled and replied: \"In your case,\\r\\nthe contrary ought to have happened. You would not be here, if she had\\r\\nhad the idea only in her head!\" Then Monsieur Beaurain was seized with\\r\\nrage, and turning to his wife, he said: \"Do you see to what you have\\r\\nbrought us with your poetry? And now we shall have to go before the\\r\\nCourts, at our age, for a breach of morals! And we shall have to shut up\\r\\nthe shop, sell our good will and go to some other neighborhood! That\\'s\\r\\nwhat it has come to!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Beaurain got up, and without looking at her husband, she\\r\\nexplained herself without any embarrassment, without useless modesty,\\r\\nand almost without hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, Monsieur, I know that we have made ourselves ridiculous.\\r\\nWill you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate; or rather like a\\r\\npoor woman; and I hope that you will be kind enough to send us home, and\\r\\nto spare us the disgrace of a prosecution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Years ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain\\'s acquaintance on\\r\\nSunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a draper\\'s shop, and I\\r\\nwas a young lady in a ready made clothing establishment. I remember it,\\r\\nas if it were yesterday. I used to come and spend Sundays here\\r\\noccasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Levéque, with whom I lived in\\r\\nthe Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had not. He used to\\r\\nbring us here, and one Saturday, he told me, laughing, that he should\\r\\nbring a friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he meant,\\r\\nbut I replied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous, Monsieur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and in\\r\\nthose days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to yield\\r\\nto him, and I did not yield. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a lovely\\r\\nday, the sort of day that tickles your heart. When it is fine, even now,\\r\\njust as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when I am in\\r\\nthe country I utterly lose my head. The verdure, the swallows flying so\\r\\nswiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies, the daisies, all\\r\\nthat makes me quite excited! It is like champagne when one is not used\\r\\nto it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to\\r\\npenetrate into your body by your eyes when you looked, and by your mouth\\r\\nwhen you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other every\\r\\nminute, and that gave me something to look at! Monsieur Beaurain and I\\r\\nwalked behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know\\r\\neach other they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid, and\\r\\nI liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood; it\\r\\nwas as cool as in a bath there, and we all four sat down. Rose and her\\r\\nlover joked me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand\\r\\nthat could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug again,\\r\\nwithout putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had not\\r\\nbeen there; and then they whispered together, and then got up and went\\r\\noff among the trees, without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked\\r\\nlike, alone with this young fellow, whom I saw for the first time. I\\r\\nfelt so confused at seeing them go that it gave me courage and I began\\r\\nto talk. I asked him what his business was, and he said he was a linen\\r\\ndraper\\'s assistant, as I told you just now. We talked for a few minutes\\r\\nand that made him bold, and he wanted to take liberties with me, but I\\r\\ntold him sharply to keep his own place. Is not that true, Monsieur\\r\\nBeaurain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur Beaurain, who was looking at his feet in confusion, did not\\r\\nreply, and she continued: \"Then he saw that I was virtuous, and he began\\r\\nto make love to me nicely, like an honorable man, and from that time he\\r\\ncame every Sunday, for he was very much in love with me. I was very fond\\r\\nof him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow, formerly,\\r\\nand in short he married me the next September, and we started in\\r\\nbusiness in the Rue des Martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a hard struggle for some years, Monsieur. Business did not\\r\\nprosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and then we\\r\\nhad grown unaccustomed to them. One has other things in one\\'s head, and\\r\\nthinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in\\r\\nbusiness. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like\\r\\nquiet people who do not think much about love. One does not regret\\r\\nanything as long as one does not notice what one has lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And after that, Monsieur, business went better, and we became tranquil\\r\\nas to the future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what passed\\r\\nwithin me, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little\\r\\nboarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers\\r\\nwhich are drawn about the streets, made me cry; the smell of violets\\r\\nsought me out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart\\r\\nbeat! Then I used to get up and go onto the doorstep to look at the\\r\\nblue sky between the roofs. When one looks at the sky from a street, it\\r\\nlooks like a river which descends on Paris, winding as it flows, and the\\r\\nswallows pass to and fro in it like fish. This sort of things is very\\r\\nstupid at my age! But what can one do, Monsieur? when one has worked all\\r\\none\\'s life? A moment comes in which one perceives that one could have\\r\\ndone something else, and then, one regrets, oh! yes, one feels great\\r\\nregret! Just think that for twenty years I might have gone and had\\r\\nkisses in the woods, like other women. I used to think how delightful it\\r\\nwould be to lie under the trees, loving some one! And I thought of it\\r\\neveryday and every night! I dreamt of the moonlight on the water, until\\r\\nI felt inclined to drown myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not venture to speak to Monsieur Beaurain about this at first. I\\r\\nknew that he would make fun of me, and send me back to sell my needles\\r\\nand cotton! And then, to speak the truth, Monsieur Beaurain never said\\r\\nmuch to me, but when I looked in the glass, I also understood quite\\r\\nwell, that I also no longer appealed to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I made up my mind, and I proposed an excursion into the country\\r\\nto him, to the place where we had first become acquainted. He agreed\\r\\nwithout any distrust, and we arrived here this morning, about nine\\r\\no\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt quite young again when I got among the corn, for a woman\\'s heart\\r\\nnever grows old! And really, I no longer saw my husband as he is at\\r\\npresent, but just like he was formerly! That I will swear to you,\\r\\nMonsieur. As true as I am standing here, I was intoxicated. I began to\\r\\nkiss him, and he was more surprised than if I had tried to murder him.\\r\\nHe kept saying to me: \\'Why, you must be mad! You are mad this morning!\\r\\nWhat is the matter with you?...\\' I did not listen to him, I only\\r\\nlistened to my own heart, and I made him come into the woods with me....\\r\\nThere it is.... I have spoken the truth, Monsieur le Maire, the whole\\r\\ntruth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayor was a sensible man. He rose from his chair, smiled, and said:\\r\\n\"Go in peace, Madame, and sin no more ... under the trees.\"',\n"," 'A FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to see my friend Simon Radevin once more, whom I had not had\\r\\na sight of for fifteen years. Formerly he used to be my most intimate\\r\\nfriend, and I used to spend long, quiet and happy evenings with him; he\\r\\nwas one of those men to whom one tells one\\'s most intimate affairs of\\r\\nthe heart, for whom one finds, when conversing tranquilly, rare, clever,\\r\\ningenious and refined thoughts, which excite the mind and put it at its\\r\\nease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, traveled,\\r\\nthought and dreamt together; had liked the same things with the same\\r\\nliking, had admired the same books, comprehended the same works,\\r\\nshivered with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same\\r\\nindividuals, whom we understood completely, by merely exchanging a\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he married; quite unexpectedly he married a little girl from the\\r\\nprovinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How ever could\\r\\nthat little, thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light,\\r\\nvacant eyes, and her clear silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred\\r\\nthousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever\\r\\nyoung fellow? Can anyone understand these things? No doubt he had hoped\\r\\nfor happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of\\r\\na good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the\\r\\ntransparent looks of that school girl with light hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not dreamt of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man\\r\\ngrows tired as soon as he has comprehended the stupid reality, unless\\r\\nindeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing more\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light\\r\\nhearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor through\\r\\nprovincial life? A man can change a great deal in the course of fifteen\\r\\nyears!\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage,\\r\\na stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to\\r\\nme with open arms, exclaiming: \"George!\" I embraced him, but I had not\\r\\nrecognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \"By Jove! You have not\\r\\ngrown thin!\" And he replied with a laugh: \"What did you expect? Good\\r\\nliving, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my\\r\\nexistence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him closely, trying to find the features I held so dear in\\r\\nthat broad face. His eyes alone had not altered, but I no longer saw the\\r\\nsame looks in them, and I said to myself: \"If the looks be the\\r\\nreflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used\\r\\nto be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of pleasure and friendship, but they had\\r\\nnot that clear, intelligent expression, which expresses as much as words\\r\\ndo, the value of the mind. Suddenly he said to me: \"Here are my two\\r\\neldest children.\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy\\r\\nof thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a _Lycée_, came forward in a\\r\\nhesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \"Are they\\r\\nyours?\" \"Of course they are,\" he replied laughing. \"How many have you?\"\\r\\n\"Five! There are three more indoors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I\\r\\nfelt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt for this\\r\\nvainglorious and simple reproducer of his species, who spent his nights\\r\\nin his country house in making children.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got into a carriage, which he drove himself, and we set off through\\r\\nthe town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town, where nothing was moving in the\\r\\nstreets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there\\r\\na shopkeeper standing at his door took off his hat, and Simon returned\\r\\nhis salute and told me the man\\'s name; no doubt to show me that he knew\\r\\nall the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was\\r\\nthinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream\\r\\nof all who have buried themselves in the provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden,\\r\\nwhich had some pretensions to being a park, and stopped in front of a\\r\\nturretted house, which tried to pass for a château.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is my den,\" Simon said, so that he might be complimented on it,\\r\\nand I replied that it was delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed up for a visitor, her hair done\\r\\nfor a visitor, and with phrases ready prepared for a visitor. She was no\\r\\nlonger the light haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years\\r\\npreviously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies\\r\\nwithout any fixed age, without intellect, without any of those things\\r\\nwhich constitute a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout,\\r\\ncommonplace mother, the human layer and brood mare, that machine of\\r\\nflesh which procreates without any other mental preoccupation, except\\r\\nher children and her housekeeping book.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged\\r\\naccording to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen\\r\\nbefore a mayor, and I said: \"Ah! ah! so these are the others?\" And\\r\\nSimon, who was radiant with pleasure, named them: \"Jean, Sophie and\\r\\nGontran.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in and in the depths of an\\r\\neasy-chair I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man.\\r\\nMadame Radevin came forward and said: \"This is my grandfather,\\r\\nMonsieur; he is eighty-seven.\" And then she shouted into the shaking old\\r\\nman\\'s ears: \"This is a friend of Simon\\'s, papa.\" The old gentleman tried\\r\\nto say \"good day\" to me, and he muttered: \"Oua, oua, oua,\" and waved his\\r\\nhand, and I took a seat, saying: \"You are very kind, Monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \"So! You have made\\r\\ngrandpapa\\'s acquaintance. He is priceless, is that old man; he is the\\r\\ndelight of the children, and he is so greedy that he almost kills\\r\\nhimself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were\\r\\nallowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He likes\\r\\nall the sweets as if they were so many girls. You have never seen\\r\\nanything funnier; you will see it presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was then shown to my room to change my dress for dinner, and hearing\\r\\na great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all\\r\\nthe children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy windows looked out onto a plain, bare, interminable plain, an ocean\\r\\nof grass, of wheat, and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising\\r\\nground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be\\r\\nleading in that house.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and so I went downstairs. Madame Radevin\\r\\ntook my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we went into the dining-room. A\\r\\nfootman wheeled in the old man\\'s armchair, who gave a greedy and curious\\r\\nlook at the dessert, as he with difficulty turned his shaking head from\\r\\none dish to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \"You will be amused,\" he said; and all the\\r\\nchildren understood that I was going to be indulged with the sight of\\r\\ntheir greedy grandfather, and they began to laugh accordingly, while\\r\\ntheir mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making\\r\\na speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \"This evening\\r\\nthere is sweet rice cream,\" and the wrinkled face of the grandfather\\r\\nbrightened, and he trembled more violently all over, showing that he had\\r\\nunderstood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look!\" Simon whispered. The grandfather did not like the soup, and\\r\\nhe refused to eat it; but he was made to, on account of his health, and\\r\\nthe footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew\\r\\nenergetically, so as not to swallow the soup, which was thus scattered\\r\\nlike a stream of water onto the table and over his neighbors. The\\r\\nchildren shook with delight at the spectacle, while their father, who\\r\\nwas also amused, said: \"Is not the old man funny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole meal, they were all taken up solely with him. He\\r\\ndevoured the dishes which were put on the table, with his eyes, and he\\r\\ntried to seize them and pull them to himself with his trembling hands.\\r\\nThey put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his\\r\\ntrembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of\\r\\nhis eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he\\r\\nslobbered onto his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering\\r\\ninarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this\\r\\nhorrible and grotesque scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they put a tiny morsel onto his plate, which he ate with feverish\\r\\ngluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when\\r\\nthe rice-cream was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with\\r\\ngreediness, and Gontran called out to him: \"You have eaten too much\\r\\nalready; you will have no more.\" And they pretended not to give him any.\\r\\nThen he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever,\\r\\nwhile all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his\\r\\nhelping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful of the\\r\\npudding, he made a comical and greedy noise in his throat, and a\\r\\nmovement with his neck like ducks do when they swallow too large a\\r\\nmorsel, and then, when he had done, he began to stamp his feet, so as to\\r\\nget more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and I\\r\\ninterposed on his behalf: \"Please, will you not give him a little more\\r\\nrice?\" But Simon replied: \"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat\\r\\ntoo much, it might harm him, at his age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI held my tongue, and thought over these words. Oh! ethics! Oh! logic!\\r\\nOh! wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining\\r\\npleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with\\r\\nit, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his\\r\\nlife, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a\\r\\nhundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the\\r\\nspectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He\\r\\nhad one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last\\r\\nsolace constantly, until he died?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I\\r\\nwas low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! I sat at my window, but I heard\\r\\nnothing but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the\\r\\ndistance. No doubt the bird was singing thus in a low voice during the\\r\\nnight, and to lull his mate, who was sleeping on her eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I thought of my poor friend\\'s five children, and pictured him to\\r\\nmyself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.',\n"," 'JOSEPH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both of them drunk, quite drunk, little Baroness Andrée de la\\r\\nFraisières and little Countess Noemi de Gardens. They had been dining\\r\\nalone together, in the large room which faced the sea. The soft breeze\\r\\nof a summer evening blew in at the open window, soft and fresh at the\\r\\nsame time, a breeze that smelt of the sea. The two young women, extended\\r\\nin their lounging chairs, sipped their Chartreuse from time to time, as\\r\\nthey smoked their cigarettes, and they were talking most confidentially,\\r\\ntelling each other details which nothing but this charming intoxication\\r\\ncould have induced their pretty lips to utter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir husbands had returned to Paris that afternoon, and had left them\\r\\nalone on that little deserted beach, which they had chosen so as to\\r\\navoid those gallant marauders who are constantly met with in fashionable\\r\\nwatering places. As they were absent for five days in the week, they\\r\\nobjected to country excursions, luncheons on the grass, swimming lessons\\r\\nand those sudden familiarities which spring up in the idle life of\\r\\nwatering places. Dieppe, Etratat, Trouville seemed to them to be places\\r\\nto be avoided, and they had rented a house which had been built and\\r\\nabandoned by an eccentric individual in the valley of Roqueville, near\\r\\nFécamp, and there they buried their wives for the whole summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were drunk. Not knowing what to hit upon to amuse themselves, the\\r\\nlittle Baroness had suggested a good dinner and champagne. To begin\\r\\nwith, they had found great amusement in cooking this dinner themselves,\\r\\nand then they had eaten it merrily, and had drunk freely, in order to\\r\\nallay the thirst which the heat of the fire had excited. Now they were\\r\\nchatting and talking nonsense, while gently gargling their throats with\\r\\nChartreuse. In fact they did not in the least know any longer what they\\r\\nwere saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess, with her legs in the air on the back of a chair, was\\r\\nfurther gone than her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To complete an evening like this,\" she said, \"we ought to have a lover\\r\\napiece. If I had foreseen this some time ago, I would have sent for a\\r\\ncouple from Paris, and I would have let you have one....\" \"I can always\\r\\nfind one,\" the other replied; \"I could have one this very evening, if I\\r\\nwished.\" \"What nonsense! At Roqueville, my dear? It would have to be\\r\\nsome peasant, then.\" \"No, not altogether.\" \"Well, tell me all about it.\"\\r\\n\"What do you want me to tell you?\" \"About your lover.\" \"My dear, I do\\r\\nnot want to live without being loved, for I should fancy I was dead if I\\r\\nwere not loved.\" \"So should I.\" \"Is not that so?\" \"Yes. Men cannot\\r\\nunderstand it! And especially our husbands!\" \"No, not in the least. How\\r\\ncan you expect it to be different? The love which we want is made up of\\r\\nbeing spoilt, of gallantries and of pretty words and actions. That is\\r\\nthe nourishment of our hearts; it is indispensable to our life,\\r\\nindispensable, indispensable....\" \"Indispensable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must feel that somebody is thinking of me, always, everywhere. When I\\r\\ngo to sleep and when I wake up, I must know that somebody loves me\\r\\nsomewhere, that I am being dreamt of, longed for. Without that, I should\\r\\nbe wretched, wretched! Oh! yes, unhappy enough to do nothing but cry.\"\\r\\n\"I am just the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember that anything else is impossible. When a husband has\\r\\nbeen nice for six months, or a year, or two years, he necessarily\\r\\nbecomes a brute, yes, a regular brute.... He does not put himself out\\r\\nfor anything, but shows himself just as he is, and makes a scene on the\\r\\nslightest provocation, or without any provocation whatever. One cannot\\r\\nlove a man with whom one lives constantly.\" \"That is quite true.\" \"Isn\\'t\\r\\nit?... What was I saying? I cannot the least remember?\" \"You were saying\\r\\nthat all husbands are brutes!\" \"Yes, brutes ... all of them.\" \"That is\\r\\nquite true.\" \"And then?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What was I saying just\\r\\nthen?\" \"I don\\'t know because you did not say it!\" \"But I had something\\r\\nto tell you.\" \"Oh! yes, that is true; well?...\" \"Oh! I have got it....\"\\r\\n\"Well, I am listening.\" \"I was telling you that I can find lovers\\r\\neverywhere.\" \"How do you manage it?\" \"Like this. Now follow me\\r\\ncarefully. When I get to some fresh place, I take notes and make my\\r\\nchoice.\" \"You make your choice?\" \"Yes, of course I do. First of all, I\\r\\ntake notes. I ask questions. Above all, a man must be discreet, rich and\\r\\ngenerous; is not that so?\" \"It is quite true!\" \"And then he must please\\r\\nme, as a man.\" \"Of course.\" \"Then I bait the hook for him.\" \"You bait\\r\\nthe hook?\" \"Yes, just as one does to catch fish. Have you never fished\\r\\nwith a hook and line?\" \"No, never.\" \"You are wrong; It is very amusing,\\r\\nand besides that, it is instructive. Well then, I bait the hook....\"\\r\\n\"How do you do it?\" \"How stupid you are. Does not one catch the man one\\r\\nwants to catch, without their having any choice? And they really think\\r\\nthat they choose ... the fools ... but it is we who choose ...\\r\\nalways.... Just think, when one is not ugly, nor stupid, as is the case\\r\\nwith us, all men aspire to us, all ... without exception. We look them\\r\\nover from morning till night, and when we have selected one, we fish for\\r\\nhim....\" \"But that does not tell me how you do it?\" \"How I do it?...\\r\\nWhy, I do nothing; I allow myself to be looked at, that is all.\" \"You\\r\\nallow yourself to be looked at?...\" \"Why yes; that is quite enough. When\\r\\none has allowed oneself to be looked at several times following, a man\\r\\nimmediately thinks you the most lovely, most seductive of women, and\\r\\nthen he begins to make love to you. I give him to understand that he is\\r\\nnot so bad looking, without saying anything to him, of course, and he\\r\\nfalls in love, like a dog. I have him fast, and it lasts a longer or a\\r\\nshorter time, according to his qualities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you catch all whom you please, like that?\" \"Nearly all.\" \"Oh! So\\r\\nthere are some who resist?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Why?\" \"Oh! Why? A man is a\\r\\nJoseph for three reasons. Because he is in love with another woman.\\r\\nBecause he is excessively timid, or because he is ... how shall I say\\r\\nit? ... incapable of carrying out the conquest of a woman to the\\r\\nend....\" \"Oh! my dear!... Do you really believe?...\" \"I am sure of\\r\\nit.... There are many of this latter class, many, many ... many more\\r\\nthan people think. Oh! they look just like everybody else ... they strut\\r\\nlike peacocks.... No, when I said peacocks ... I made a mistake, for\\r\\nthey could not display themselves.\" \"Oh! my dear....\" \"As to the timid,\\r\\nthey are sometimes unspeakably stupid. They are the sort of men, who\\r\\nought not to undress themselves, even when they are going to bed alone,\\r\\nwhen there is a looking-glass in their room. With them, one must be\\r\\nenergetic, make use of looks, and squeeze their hands, and even that is\\r\\nuseless sometimes. They never know how or where to begin. When one\\r\\nfaints in their presence ... as a last resource ... they try to bring\\r\\nyou round ... and if you do not recover your senses immediately ... they\\r\\ngo and get assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those whom I prefer myself, are other women\\'s lovers. I carry them by\\r\\nassault ... at ... at ... at the point of the bayonet, my dear!\" \"That\\r\\nis all very well, but when there are no men, like here, for instance?\"\\r\\n\"I find them!\" \"You find them. But where?\" \"Everywhere. But that reminds\\r\\nme of my story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now listen. Just two years ago, my husband made me pass the summer on\\r\\nhis estate at Bougrolles. There was nothing there ... you know what I\\r\\nmean, nothing, nothing, nothing, whatever! In the neighboring country\\r\\nhouses there were a few disgusting boors, who cared for nothing but\\r\\nshooting, and who lived in country houses which had not even a bathroom,\\r\\nmen who perspire, go to bed covered with perspiration, and whom it would\\r\\nbe impossible to improve, because their principles of life are dirty.\\r\\nNow just guess what I did!\" \"I cannot possibly.\" \"Ha! ha! ha! I had\\r\\njust been reading a number of George Sand\\'s novels which exalt the man\\r\\nof the people, novels in which the workmen are sublime, and all the men\\r\\nof the world are criminals. In addition to this I had seen Ruy Blas the\\r\\nwinter before, and it had struck me very much. Well, one of our farmers\\r\\nhad a son, a good-looking young fellow of two and twenty who had studied\\r\\nfor a priest, but had left the seminary in disgust. Well, I took him as\\r\\nfootman!\" \"Oh!... And then?... What afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then ... then, my dear, I treated him very haughtily, and showed him a\\r\\ngood deal of my person. I did not entice this rustic on, I simply\\r\\ninflamed him!...\" \"Oh! Andrée!\" \"Yes, and I enjoyed the fun very much.\\r\\nPeople say that servants count for nothing! Well he did not count for\\r\\nmuch. I used to ring to give him his orders every morning while my maid\\r\\nwas dressing me, and every evening as well, while she was undressing\\r\\nme.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear he caught fire like a thatched roof. Then, at meals, I used\\r\\ncontinually to talk about cleanliness, about taking care of one\\'s\\r\\nperson, about baths and shower baths, until at the end of a fortnight he\\r\\nbathed in the river morning and night, and used to scent himself enough\\r\\nto poison the whole château. I was even obliged to forbid him to use\\r\\nperfumes, telling him, with furious looks, that men ought never to use\\r\\nscent except Eau de Cologne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, I took it into my head to get together a library suitable to the\\r\\ncountry. I sent for a few hundred moral novels, which I lent to all our\\r\\npeasants, and all my servants. A few books ... a few ... poetical books\\r\\n... such as excite the mind of ... schoolboys and schoolgirls ... had\\r\\nfound their way into my collection ... and I gave them to my footman.\\r\\nThat taught him life ... a funny sort of life.\" \"Oh! Andrée!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I grew familiar with him, and used to say thou[18] to him. I had\\r\\ngiven him the name of Joseph. And, my dear, he was in a state ... in a\\r\\nterrible state.... He got as thin as ... as a barn-door cock ... and\\r\\nrolled his eyes like an idiot. I was extremely amused; it was one of the\\r\\nmost delightful summers I ever spent....\" \"And then?...\" \"Then?... Oh!\\r\\nyes.... Well, one day when my husband was away from home, I told him to\\r\\norder the basket carriage and to drive me into the woods. It was warm,\\r\\nvery warm.... There!\" \"Oh Andrée, do tell me all about it.... It is so\\r\\namusing....\" \"Here have a glass of Chartreuse, otherwise I shall empty\\r\\nthe decanter myself. Well, I felt ill, on the road.\" \"How?\" \"You are\\r\\nvery stupid. I told him that I was not feeling well, and that he must\\r\\nlay me on the grass, and when I was lying there, I told him I was\\r\\nchoking, and that he must unlace me. And then, when I was unlaced, I\\r\\nfainted.\" \"Did you go right off?\" \"Oh! dear no, not the least.\" \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I was obliged to remain unconscious for nearly an hour, as he\\r\\ncould find no means of bringing me round. But I was very patient, and\\r\\ndid not open my eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée!... And what did you say to him?\" \"I? Nothing at all! How\\r\\nwas I to know anything, as I was unconscious? I thanked him, and told\\r\\nhim to help me into the carriage, and he drove me back to the Château;\\r\\nbut he nearly upset us in turning into the gate!\" \"Oh! Andrée! And is\\r\\nthat all?...\" \"That is all....\" \"You did not faint more than that once?\"\\r\\n\"Only once, of course! I did not want to take such a fellow for my\\r\\nlover.\" \"Did you keep him long after that?\" \"Yes, of course. I have him\\r\\nstill. Why should I have sent him away? I had nothing to complain of.\"\\r\\n\"Oh! Andrée! And is he in love with you still?\" \"Of course he is.\"\\r\\n\"Where is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Baroness put out her hand to the wall and touched the\\r\\nelectric bell, and the door opened almost immediately, and a tall\\r\\nfootman came in who diffused a scent of Eau de Cologne all round him.\\r\\n\"Joseph,\" she said to him, \"I am afraid I am going to faint; send my\\r\\nlady\\'s maid to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood motionless, like a soldier before his officer, and fixed\\r\\nan ardent look on his mistress, who continued: \"Go quickly, you great\\r\\nidiot, we are not in the wood to-day, and Rosalie will attend to me\\r\\nbetter than you would.\" He turned on his heels and went, and the little\\r\\nBaroness asked nervously: \"But what shall you say to your maid?\" \"I\\r\\nshall tell her what we have been doing! No, I shall merely get her to\\r\\nunlace me; it will relieve my chest, for I can scarcely breathe. I am\\r\\ndrunk ... my dear ... so drunk that I should fall, if I were to get up\\r\\nfrom my chair.\"',\n"," 'THE INN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all the wooden inns in the higher Alps, which are situated in the\\r\\nrocky and bare gorges which intersect the white summits of the\\r\\nmountains, the inn of Schwarenbach stands as a refuge for travelers who\\r\\nare crossing the Gemmi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remains open for six months in the year, and is inhabited by the\\r\\nfamily of Jean Hauser; then, as soon as the snow begins to fall, and\\r\\nfills the valley so as to make the road down to Loëche impassable, the\\r\\nfather and his three sons go away, and leave the house in charge of the\\r\\nold guide, Gaspard Hari, with the young guide, Ulrich Kunzi, and Sam,\\r\\nthe great mountain dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men and the dog remained till the spring in their snowy prison,\\r\\nwith nothing before their eyes except the immense, white slopes of the\\r\\nBalmhorn; they were surrounded by light, glistening summits, and shut\\r\\nup, blocked up and buried by the snow which rose around them, and which\\r\\nenveloped, bound and crushed the little house, which lay piled on the\\r\\nroof, reached to the windows and blocked up the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to\\r\\nLoëche, as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming\\r\\ndangerous. Three mules started first, laden with baggage and led by the\\r\\nthree sons. Then the mother, Jean Hauser and her daughter Louise mounted\\r\\na fourth mule, and set off in their turn, and the father followed them,\\r\\naccompanied by the two men in charge, who were to escort the family as\\r\\nfar as the brow of the descent. First of all they passed round the small\\r\\nlake, which was now frozen over, at the bottom of the mass of rocks\\r\\nwhich stretched in front of the inn, and then they followed the valley,\\r\\nwhich was dominated on all sides by the snow covered summits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ray of sunlight fell into that little white, glistening, frozen\\r\\ndesert, and illuminated it with a cold and dazzling flame; no living\\r\\nthing appeared among this ocean of hills; there was nothing more in this\\r\\nimmeasurable solitude, and no noise disturbed the profound silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees the young guide Ulrich Kunzi, a tall, long legged Swiss, left\\r\\ndaddy Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to catch up to the mule,\\r\\nwhich carried the two women. The younger one looked at him as he\\r\\napproached, and appeared to be calling him, with her sad eyes. She was a\\r\\nyoung, light haired peasant girl, whose milk white cheeks and pale hair\\r\\nlooked as if they had lost their color by their long abode amidst the\\r\\nice. When he had got up with the animal which carried them, he put his\\r\\nhand on the crupper, and relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk\\r\\nto him, and enumerated with the minutest details all that he would have\\r\\nto attend to during the winter. It was the first time that he was going\\r\\nto stop up there, while old Hari had already spent fourteen winters\\r\\namidst the snow, at the inn of Schwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened, without appearing to understand, and looked\\r\\nincessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied: \"Yes, Madame\\r\\nHauser;\" but his thoughts seemed far away, and his calm features\\r\\nremained unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface extended to the\\r\\nbottom of the valley. On the right, the Daubenhorn showed its black\\r\\nrocks, rising up in a peak above the enormous moraines of the Lömmeon\\r\\nglacier, which rose above the Wildstrubel. As they approached the neck\\r\\nof the Gemmi, where the descent to Loëche begins, they suddenly beheld\\r\\nthe immense horizon of the Alps of the Valais, from which the broad,\\r\\ndeep valley of the Rhone separated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance, there was a group of white, unequal flat or pointed\\r\\nmountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the Mischabel with its two\\r\\npeaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn, the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty\\r\\nand formidable pyramid of Mont Cervin, that slayer of men, and the\\r\\nDent-Blanche, that terrible coquette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, beneath them, in a tremendous hole, at the bottom of a terrible\\r\\nabyss, they perceived Loëche, where houses looked as grains of sand\\r\\nwhich had been thrown in that enormous crevice, which finishes and\\r\\ncloses the Gemmi, and which opens, down below, onto the Rhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mule stopped at the edge of the path, which goes turning and\\r\\ntwisting continually, and which comes back fantastically and strangely,\\r\\nalong the side of the mountain, as far as the almost invisible little\\r\\nvillage at its feet. The women jumped into the snow, and the two old men\\r\\njoined them. \"Well,\" father Hauser said, \"good-bye, and keep up your\\r\\nspirits till next year, my friends,\" and old Hari replied: \"Till next\\r\\nyear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey embraced each other, and then Madame Hauser in her turn, offered\\r\\nher cheek, and the girl did the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulrich Kunzi\\'s turn came, he whispered in Louise\\'s ear: \"Do not\\r\\nforget those up yonder,\" and she replied: \"no,\" in such a low voice,\\r\\nthat he guessed what she had said, without hearing it. \"Well, adieu,\"\\r\\nJean Hauser repeated, \"and don\\'t fall ill.\" And going before the two\\r\\nwomen, he commenced the descent, and soon all three disappeared at the\\r\\nfirst turn in the road, while the two men returned to the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked slowly, side by side, without speaking. It was over, and\\r\\nthey would be alone together for four or five months. Then Gaspard Bari\\r\\nbegan to relate his life last winter. He had remained with Michael\\r\\nCanol, who was too old now to stand it; for an accident might happen\\r\\nduring that long solitude. They had not been dull, however; the only\\r\\nthing was to make up one\\'s mind to it from the first, and in the end one\\r\\nwould find plenty of distraction, games and other means of whiling away\\r\\nthe time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in his\\r\\nthoughts he was following those who were descending to the village. They\\r\\nsoon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so\\r\\nsmall did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of\\r\\nsnow, and when they opened the door, Sam, the great curly dog, began to\\r\\nromp round them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, my boy,\" old Gaspard said, \"we have no women now, so we must get\\r\\nour own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes.\" And they both sat down\\r\\non wooden stools, and began to put the bread into the soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning seemed very long to Kunzi. Old Hari smoked and spat\\r\\nonto the hearth, while the young man looked out of the window at the\\r\\nsnow-covered mountain opposite the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon he went out, and going over yesterday\\'s ground again,\\r\\nhe looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the two women;\\r\\nthen when he had reached the neck of the Gemmi, he laid himself down on\\r\\nhis stomach and looked at Loëche.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow,\\r\\nalthough it came quite close to it, but it was stopped short by the pine\\r\\nwoods which protected it. Its low houses looked like paving stones in a\\r\\nlarge meadow, from up there. Hauser\\'s little daughter was there now, in\\r\\none of those gray colored houses. In which? Ulrich Kunzi was too far\\r\\naway to be able to make them out separately. How he would have liked to\\r\\ngo down, while he was yet able!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the Wildstrubel,\\r\\nand the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari was smoking, and\\r\\nwhen he saw his mate come in, he proposed a game of cards to him, and\\r\\nthey sat down opposite each other, on either side of the table. They\\r\\nplayed for a long time, a simple game called _brisque_, and then they\\r\\nhad supper and went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following days were like the first, bright and cold, without any\\r\\nmore snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the eagles and\\r\\nother rare birds which ventured onto those frozen heights, while Ulrich\\r\\nreturned regularly to the neck of the Gemmi to look at the village. Then\\r\\nthey played at cards, dice or dominoes, and lost and won a trifle, just\\r\\nto create an interest in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A moving deep\\r\\nand light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly, and was\\r\\nby degrees burying them under a thick, dark coverlet of foam, and that\\r\\nlasted four days and four nights. It was necessary to free the door and\\r\\nthe windows, to dig out a passage and to cut steps to get over this\\r\\nfrozen powder, which a twelve hours frost had made as hard as the\\r\\ngranite of the moraines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived like prisoners, and did not venture outside their abode. They\\r\\nhad divided their duties, which they performed regularly. Ulrich Kunzi\\r\\nundertook the scouring, washing, and everything that belonged to\\r\\ncleanliness. He also chopped up the wood, while Gaspard Hari did the\\r\\ncooking and attended to the fire. Their regular and monotonous work was\\r\\ninterrupted by long games at cards or dice, and they never quarreled,\\r\\nbut were always calm and placid. They were never even impatient or\\r\\nill-humored, nor did they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a\\r\\nstock of patience for their wintering on the top of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and\\r\\noccasionally he killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at\\r\\nSchwarenbach, and they reveled in fresh meat. One morning he went out as\\r\\nusual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of frost, and as\\r\\nthe sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to surprise the animals at\\r\\nthe approaches to the Wildstrubel, and Ulrich, being alone, remained in\\r\\nbed until ten o\\'clock. He was of a sleepy nature, but he would not have\\r\\ndared to give way like that to his inclination in the presence of the\\r\\nold guide, who was ever an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with\\r\\nSam, who also spent his days and nights in sleeping in front of the\\r\\nfire; then he felt low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and\\r\\nwas seized by a longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the\\r\\ndesire of an invincible habit, and so he went out to meet his companion,\\r\\nwho was to return at four o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow had leveled the whole deep valley, filled up the _crevasses_,\\r\\nobliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the rocks, so that\\r\\nbetween the high summits there was nothing but an immense, white,\\r\\nregular, dazzling and frozen surface. For three weeks, Ulrich had not\\r\\nbeen to the edge of the precipice, from which he had looked down onto\\r\\nthe village, and he wanted to go there before climbing the slopes which\\r\\nled to Wildstrubel. Loëche was now also covered by the snow, and the\\r\\nhouses could scarcely be distinguished, covered as they were by that\\r\\nwhite cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to the right, he reached the Lämmern glacier. He went along\\r\\nwith a mountaineer\\'s long strides, striking the snow, which was as hard\\r\\nas a rock, with his iron-shod stick, and with his piercing eyes, he\\r\\nlooked for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that\\r\\nenormous, white expanse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached the end of the glacier he stopped and asked himself\\r\\nwhether the old man had taken that road, and then he began to walk along\\r\\nthe moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The day was declining; the\\r\\nsnow was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry, frozen wind blew in rough\\r\\ngusts over its crystal surface. Ulrich uttered a long, shrill, vibrating\\r\\ncall; his voice sped through the deathlike silence in which the\\r\\nmountains were sleeping; it reached the distance, over profound and\\r\\nmotionless waves of glacial foam, like the cry of a bird over the waves\\r\\nof the sea; then it died away and nothing answered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set to walk again. The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain tops,\\r\\nwhich were still purple with the reflection from the sky; but the depths\\r\\nof the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt\\r\\nfrightened. It seemed to him as if the silence, the cold, the solitude,\\r\\nthe winter death of these mountains were taking possession of him, were\\r\\ngoing to stop and to freeze his blood, to make his limbs grow stiff, and\\r\\nto turn him into a motionless and frozen object; and he set off running,\\r\\nfleeing towards his dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have\\r\\nreturned during his absence. He had taken another road; he would, no\\r\\ndoubt, be sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe soon came in sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it. Ulrich\\r\\nwalked faster and opened the door; Sam ran up to him to greet him, but\\r\\nGaspard Hari had not returned. Kunzi, in his alarm, turned round\\r\\nsuddenly, as if he had expected to find his comrade hidden in a corner.\\r\\nThen he re-lighted the fire and made the soup; hoping every moment to\\r\\nsee the old man come in. From time to time he went out, to see if he\\r\\nwere not coming in. It was quite night now, that wan night of the\\r\\nmountains, a livid night, with the crescent moon, yellow and dim and\\r\\njust disappearing behind the mountain tops, lit up on the edge of the\\r\\nhorizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and his feet,\\r\\nwhile he pictured to himself every possible accident. Gaspard might have\\r\\nbroken a leg, have fallen into a crevasse, taken a false step and\\r\\ndislocated his ankle. And perhaps he was lying on the snow, overcome and\\r\\nstiff with the cold, in agony of mind, lost and perhaps shouting for\\r\\nhelp, calling with all his might, in the silence of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut where? The mountain was so vast, so rugged, so dangerous in places,\\r\\nespecially at that time of the year, that it would have required ten or\\r\\ntwenty guides to walk for a week in all directions, to find a man in\\r\\nthat immense space. Ulrich Kunzi, however, made up his mind to set out\\r\\nwith Sam, if Gaspard did not return by one in the morning; and he made\\r\\nhis preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel climbing\\r\\nirons, tied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist and looked to see\\r\\nthat his iron-shod stick and his axe, which served to cut steps in the\\r\\nice, were in order. Then he waited. The fire was burning on the hearth\\r\\nand the great dog was snoring in front of it, and the clock was ticking\\r\\nas regularly as a heart beating, in its case of resounding wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waited, with his ears on the alert for distant sounds, and he\\r\\nshivered when the wind blew against the roof and the walls. It struck\\r\\ntwelve, and he trembled. Then, as he felt frightened and shuddering, he\\r\\nput some water on the fire, so that he might have some hot coffee before\\r\\nstarting, and when the clock struck one he got up, woke Sam, opened the\\r\\ndoor and went off in the direction of the Wildstrubel. For five hours he\\r\\nmounted, scaling the rocks by means of his climbing irons, cutting into\\r\\nthe ice, advancing continually and occasionally hauling up the dog, who\\r\\nremained below at the foot of some slope that was too steep for him, by\\r\\nmeans of the rope. It was about six o\\'clock when he reached one of the\\r\\nsummits to which old Gaspard often came after chamois, and he waited\\r\\ntill it should be daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was growing pale over head, and suddenly a strange light,\\r\\nspringing, nobody could tell whence, illuminated the immense ocean of\\r\\npale mountain summits, which stretched for a thousand leagues around\\r\\nhim. One might have said that this vague brightness arose from the snow\\r\\nitself, in order to spread itself into space. By degrees the highest,\\r\\ndistant summits assumed a delicate, fleshlike rose color, and the red\\r\\nsun appeared behind the ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich Kunzi set off again, walking like a hunter, bent and looking for\\r\\nany traces, and saying to his dog: \"Seek, old fellow, seek!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely, and\\r\\nfrom time to time shouting, uttering a loud, prolonged cry, which soon\\r\\ndied away in that silent vastness. Then, he put his ear to the ground,\\r\\nto listen; he thought he could distinguish a voice, and so he began to\\r\\nrun, and shouted again, but he heard nothing more and sat down, worn out\\r\\nand in despair. Towards midday, he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as\\r\\ntired as himself, something to eat also, and then he recommenced his\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came he was still walking, and he had walked more than\\r\\nthirty miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return home,\\r\\nand too tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a hole in the\\r\\nsnow and crouched in it with his dog, under a blanket which he had\\r\\nbrought with him. And the man and the dog lay side by side, warming\\r\\nthemselves one against the other, but frozen to the marrow,\\r\\nnevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept, his mind haunted by visions and his\\r\\nlimbs shaking with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron bars,\\r\\nand his spirits so low that he was ready to cry with grief, while his\\r\\nheart was beating so that he almost fell with excitement, when he\\r\\nthought he heard a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he imagined that he also was going to die of cold in the midst\\r\\nof this vast solitude, and the terror of such a death roused his\\r\\nenergies and gave him renewed vigor. He was descending towards the inn,\\r\\nfalling down and getting up again, and followed at a distance by Sam,\\r\\nwho was limping on three legs, and they did not reach Schwarenbach until\\r\\nfour o\\'clock in the afternoon. The house was empty, and the young man\\r\\nmade a fire, had something to eat and went to sleep, so worn out that he\\r\\ndid not think of anything more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slept for a long time, for a very long time, an unconquerable sleep.\\r\\nBut suddenly a voice, a cry, a name: \"Ulrich,\" aroused him from his\\r\\nprofound torpor and made him sit up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was it\\r\\none of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds?\\r\\nNo, he heard it still, that reverberating cry,--which had entered at his\\r\\nears and remained in his flesh,--to the tips of his sinewy fingers.\\r\\nCertainly, somebody had cried out, and called: \"Ulrich!\" There was\\r\\nsomebody there, near the house, there could be no doubt of that, and he\\r\\nopened the door and shouted: \"Is it you, Gaspard?\" with all the strength\\r\\nof his lungs. But there was no reply, no murmur, no groan, nothing. It\\r\\nwas quite dark, and the snow looked wan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind had risen, that icy wind that cracks the rocks, and leaves\\r\\nnothing alive on those deserted heights, and it came in sudden gusts,\\r\\nwhich were more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the\\r\\ndesert, and again Ulrich shouted: \"Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard!\" And then\\r\\nhe waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain! Then he shook\\r\\nwith terror and with a bound he was inside the inn, when he shut and\\r\\nbolted the door, and then he fell into a chair, trembling all over, for\\r\\nhe felt certain that his comrade had called him, at the moment he was\\r\\nexpiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sure of that, as sure as one is of being alive, or of eating a\\r\\npiece of bread. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two days and three\\r\\nnights somewhere, in some hole, in one of those deep, untrodden ravines\\r\\nwhose whiteness is more sinister than subterranean darkness. He had been\\r\\ndying for two days and three nights and he had just then died, thinking\\r\\nof his comrade. His soul, almost before it was released, had taken its\\r\\nflight to the inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by\\r\\nthat terrible and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead have,\\r\\nto haunt the living. That voiceless soul had cried to the wornout soul\\r\\nof the sleeper; it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach, or\\r\\nits curse on the man who had not searched carefully enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the wall,\\r\\nbehind the door which he had just fastened. It was wandering about, like\\r\\na night bird, which lightly touches a lighted window with his wings,\\r\\nand the terrified young man was ready to scream with horror. He wanted\\r\\nto run away, but did not dare to go out; he did not dare, and he should\\r\\nnever dare to do it in the future, for that phantom would remain there\\r\\nday and night, round the inn, as long as the old man\\'s body was not\\r\\nrecovered and had not been deposited in the consecrated earth of a\\r\\nchurchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight, Kunzi recovered some of his courage at the return\\r\\nof the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some food, and\\r\\nthen remained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart as he thought of\\r\\nthe old man lying on the snow, and then, as soon as night once more\\r\\ncovered the mountains, new terrors assailed him. He now walked up and\\r\\ndown the dark kitchen, which was scarcely lighted by the flame of one\\r\\ncandle, and he walked from one end of it to the other with great\\r\\nstrides, listening, listening whether the terrible cry of the other\\r\\nnight would again break the dreary silence outside. He felt himself\\r\\nalone, unhappy man, as no man had ever been alone before! He was alone\\r\\nin this immense desert of snow, alone five thousand feet above the\\r\\ninhabited earth, above human habitations, above that stirring, noisy,\\r\\npalpitating life, alone under an icy sky! A mad longing impelled him to\\r\\nrun away, no matter where, to get down to Loëche by flinging himself\\r\\nover the precipice; but he did not even dare to open the door, as he\\r\\nfelt sure that the other, the dead man, would bar his road, so that he\\r\\nmight not be obliged to remain up there alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards midnight, tired with walking, wornout by grief and fear, he at\\r\\nlast fell into a doze in his chair, for he was as afraid of his bed, as\\r\\none is of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the other\\r\\nevening pierced his ears, and it was so shrill that Ulrich stretched\\r\\nout his arms to repulse the ghost, and he fell onto his back with his\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl, like frightened dogs\\r\\ndo howl, and he walked all about the house, trying to find out where the\\r\\ndanger came from; but when he got to the door, he sniffed beneath it,\\r\\nsmelling vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail stiff, while\\r\\nhe growled angrily. Kunzi, who was terrified, jumped up, and holding his\\r\\nchair by one leg, he cried: \"Don\\'t come in, don\\'t come in, or I shall\\r\\nkill you.\" And the dog, excited by this threat, barked angrily at that\\r\\ninvisible enemy who defied his master\\'s voice. By degrees, however, he\\r\\nquieted down and came back and stretched himself in front of the fire,\\r\\nbut he was uneasy, and kept his head up, and growled between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with terror,\\r\\nhe went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard, and he drank\\r\\noff several glasses, one after another, at a gulp. His ideas became\\r\\nvague, his courage revived, and a feverish glow ran through his veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate scarcely anything the next day, and limited himself to alcohol,\\r\\nand so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As soon as he\\r\\nthought of Gaspard Hari, he began to drink again, and went on drinking\\r\\nuntil he fell onto the ground, overcome by intoxication. And there he\\r\\nremained on his face, dead drunk, his limbs benumbed, and snoring, with\\r\\nhis face to the ground. But scarcely had he digested the maddening and\\r\\nburning liquor, than the same cry, \"Ulrich,\" woke him like a bullet\\r\\npiercing his brain, and he got up, still staggering, stretching out his\\r\\nhands to save himself from falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And\\r\\nthe dog, who appeared to be going mad, like his master, rushed to the\\r\\ndoor, scratched it with his claws, and gnawed it with his long white\\r\\nteeth, while the young man, with his neck thrown back, and his head in\\r\\nthe air, drank the brandy in draughts, as if it had been cold water, so\\r\\nthat it might by and by send his thoughts, his frantic terror and his\\r\\nmemory, to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits, but his\\r\\ncontinual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke more furiously\\r\\nthan ever, as soon as it was impossible for him to calm it. His fixed\\r\\nidea then, which had been intensified by a month of drunkenness, and\\r\\nwhich was continually increasing in his absolute solitude, penetrated\\r\\nhim like a gimlet. He now walked about his house like a wild beast in\\r\\nits cage, putting his ear to the door to listen if the other were there,\\r\\nand defying him through the wall. Then, as soon as he dozed, overcome by\\r\\nfatigue, he heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last one night, like cowards do when driven to extremities, he sprang\\r\\nto the door and opened it, to see who was calling him, and to force him\\r\\nto keep quiet, but such a gust of cold wind blew into his face that it\\r\\nchilled him to the bone, and he closed and bolted the door again\\r\\nimmediately, without noticing that Sam had rushed out. Then, as he was\\r\\nshivering with cold, he threw some wood on the fire, and sat down in\\r\\nfront of it to warm himself, but suddenly he started, for somebody was\\r\\nscratching at the wall, and crying. In desperation he called out: \"Go\\r\\naway!\" but was answered by another long, sorrowful wail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, all his remaining senses forsook him, from sheer fright. He\\r\\nrepeated: \"Go away!\" and turned round to try to find some corner in\\r\\nwhich to hide, while the other person went round the house, still crying\\r\\nand rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak sideboard, which\\r\\nwas full of plates and dishes and of provisions, and lifting it up with\\r\\nsuperhuman strength, he dragged it to the door, so as to form a\\r\\nbarricade. Then piling up all the rest of the furniture, the mattresses,\\r\\npalliasses and chairs, he stopped up the windows like one does when\\r\\nassailed by an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful groans, to\\r\\nwhich the young man replied by similar groans, and thus days and nights\\r\\npassed, without their ceasing to howl at each other. The one was\\r\\ncontinually walking round the house, and scraped the walls with his\\r\\nnails so vigorously that it seemed as if he wished to destroy them,\\r\\nwhile the other, inside, followed all his movements, stooping down, and\\r\\nholding his ear to the walls, and replying to all his appeals with\\r\\nterrible cries. One evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he\\r\\nsat down, so overcome by fatigue, that he went to sleep immediately, and\\r\\nawoke in the morning without a thought, without any recollection of what\\r\\nhad happened, just as if his head had been emptied during his heavy\\r\\nsleep, but he felt hungry, and he ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter was over, and the Gemmi pass was practicable again, so the\\r\\nHauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as they had\\r\\nreached the top of the ascent, the women mounted their mule, and spoke\\r\\nabout the two men who they would meet again shortly. They were, indeed,\\r\\nrather surprised that neither of them had come down a few days before,\\r\\nas soon as the road became usable, in order to tell them all about their\\r\\nlong winter sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered\\r\\nwith snow, like a quilt. The door and the window were closed, but a\\r\\nlittle smoke was coming out of the chimney, which reassured old Hauser;\\r\\non going up to the door, however, he saw the skeleton of an animal which\\r\\nhad been torn to pieces by the eagles, a large skeleton lying on its\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all looked closely at it, and the mother said: \"That must be Sam,\"\\r\\nand then she shouted: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" A cry from the interior of the\\r\\nhouse answered her, and a sharp cry, that one might have thought some\\r\\nanimal had uttered it. Old Hauser repeated: \"Hi! Gaspard!\" and they\\r\\nheard another cry, similar to the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open the door,\\r\\nbut it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall they took a beam\\r\\nto serve as a battering-ram, and hurled it against the door with all\\r\\ntheir might. The wood gave way, and the boards flew into splinters; then\\r\\nthe house was shaken by a loud voice, and inside, behind the sideboard,\\r\\nwhich was overturned, they saw a man standing upright, with his hair\\r\\nfalling onto his shoulders, and a beard descending to his breast, with\\r\\nshining eyes and nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize\\r\\nhim, but Louise Hauser exclaimed: \"It is Ulrich, mother.\" And her mother\\r\\ndeclared that it was Ulrich, although his hair was white.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe allowed them to go up to him, and to touch him, but he did not reply\\r\\nto any of their questions, and they were obliged to take him to Loëche,\\r\\nwhere the doctors found that he was mad, and nobody ever knew what had\\r\\nbecome of his companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which the\\r\\nmedical men attributed to the cold air of the mountains.',\n"," 'UGLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, at this blessed epoch of Equality of mediocrity, of\\r\\nrectangular abomination, as Edgar Poe says, at this delightful period,\\r\\nwhen everybody dreams of resembling everybody else, so that it has\\r\\nbecome impossible to tell the President of the Republic from a waiter;\\r\\nin these days, which are the forerunners of that promising, blissful\\r\\nday, when everything in this world will be of a dully, neuter\\r\\nuniformity, certainly at such an epoch, one has the right, or rather it\\r\\nis one\\'s duty, to be ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, assuredly, exercised that right with the most cruel vigor,\\r\\nand he fulfilled that duty with the fiercest heroism, and to make\\r\\nmatters worse, the mysterious irony of fate had caused him to be born\\r\\nwith the name of Lebeau, while an ingenious godfather, the unconscious\\r\\naccomplice of the pranks of destiny, had given him the Christian name of\\r\\nAntinous.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven among our contemporaries, who were already on the high road to the\\r\\ncoming ideal of universal ugliness, Antinous Lebeau was remarkable for\\r\\nhis ugliness, and one might have said that he positively threw zeal, too\\r\\nmuch zeal, into the matter, though he was not hideous like Mirabeau, who\\r\\nmade the people exclaim: \"Oh! the beautiful monster!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! No. He was without any beauty, even without the beauty of\\r\\nugliness. He was ugly, that was all; nothing more nor less; in short, he\\r\\nwas uglily ugly. He was not humpbacked, nor knock-kneed, nor\\r\\npot-bellied; his legs were not like a pair of tongs, and his arms were\\r\\nneither too long nor too short, and yet, there was an utter lack of\\r\\nuniformity about him, not only in painters\\' eyes, but also in\\r\\neverybody\\'s, for nobody could meet him in the street without turning to\\r\\nlook after him, and thinking: \"Good heavens! What an object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hair was of no particular color; a light chestnut, mixed with\\r\\nyellow. There was not much of it, but still, he was not absolutely bald,\\r\\nbut quite bald enough to allow his butter-colored pate to show.\\r\\nButter-colored? Hardly! The color of margarine would be more applicable,\\r\\nand such pale margarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face was also like margarine, but of adulterated margarine,\\r\\ncertainly. By the side of it, his _cranium_, the color of unadulterated\\r\\nmargarine, looked almost like butter, by comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was very little to say about his mouth! Less than little; the sum\\r\\ntotal was--nothing. It was a chimerical mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut take it, that I have said nothing about him, and let us replace this\\r\\nvain description by the useful formula: _Impossible to describe him_.\\r\\nBut you must not forget that Antinous Lebeau was ugly, that the fact\\r\\nimpressed everybody as soon as they saw him, and that nobody remembered\\r\\never having seen an uglier person; and let us add, that as the climax of\\r\\nhis misfortune, he thought so himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this you will see that he was not a fool, but, then, he was not\\r\\nill-natured, either; but, of course, he was unhappy. An unhappy man\\r\\nthinks only of his wretchedness, and people take his night cap for a\\r\\nfool\\'s cap, while, on the other hand, goodness is only esteemed when it\\r\\nis cheerful. Consequently, Antinous Lebeau passed for a fool, and an\\r\\nill-tempered fool, and he was not even pitied because he was so ugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had only one pleasure in life, and that was to go and roam about the\\r\\ndarkest streets on dark nights, and to hear the street-walkers say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come home with me, you handsome, dark man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, alas! a furtive pleasure, and he knew that it was not true. For,\\r\\noccasionally, when the woman was old or drunk and he profited by the\\r\\ninvitation, as soon as the candle was lighted in the garret, they no\\r\\nlonger murmured the fallacious: _handsome, dark man_; and when they saw\\r\\nhim, the old women grew still older, and the drunken women got sober.\\r\\nAnd more than one, although hardened against disgust, and ready for all\\r\\nrisks, said to him, and in spite of his liberal payment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My little man, you are most confoundedly ugly, I must say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, however, he renounced even that lamentable pleasure, when he\\r\\nheard the still more lamentable words which a wretched woman could not\\r\\nhelp uttering when he went home with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he must have been very hungry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! He was hungry, unhappy man; hungry for love, for something that\\r\\nshould resemble love, were it ever so little; he longed not to live like\\r\\na pariah any more, not to be exiled and proscribed in his ugliness. And\\r\\nthe ugliest, the most repugnant woman would have appeared beautiful to\\r\\nhim, if she would only have not consented to think him ugly, or, at any\\r\\nrate, not to tell him so, and not to let him see that she felt horror\\r\\nat him on that account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequence was, that, when he one day met a poor, blear-eyed\\r\\ncreature, with her face covered with scabs, and bearing evident signs of\\r\\nalcoholism, with a driveling mouth, and ragged and filthy petticoats, to\\r\\nwhom he gave liberal alms, for which she kissed his hand, he took her\\r\\nhome with him, had her clean dressed and taken care of, made her his\\r\\nservant, and then his housekeeper. Next he raised her to the rank of his\\r\\nmistress, and, finally, of course, he married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was almost as ugly as he was! She really was; but only, almost.\\r\\nAlmost, but certainly not quite; for she was hideous, and her\\r\\nhideousness had its charm and its beauty, no doubt; that something by\\r\\nwhich a woman can attract a man. And she had proved that by deceiving\\r\\nhim, and she let him see it better still, by seducing another man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat other was actually uglier than he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was certainly uglier, that collection of every physical and moral\\r\\nugliness, that companion of beggars whom she had picked up among her\\r\\nformer vagrant associates, that jailbird, that dealer in little girls,\\r\\nthat vagabond covered with filth, with legs like a toad\\'s, with a mouth\\r\\nlike a lamprey, and a death\\'s head, in which the nose had been replaced\\r\\nby two holes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have wronged me with a wretch like that,\" the poor cuckold\\r\\nsaid. \"And in my own house! and in such a manner that I might catch you\\r\\nin the very act! And why, why, you wretch? Why, seeing that he is uglier\\r\\nthan I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no,\" she exclaimed. \"You may say what you like, but do not say that\\r\\nhe is uglier than you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the unhappy man stood there, vanquished and overcome by her last\\r\\nwords, which she uttered without understanding all the horror which he\\r\\nwould feel at them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you see, he has his own particular ugliness, while you are\\r\\nmerely ugly like everybody else is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Literally, \"The bird flies\"--a pun on the verb voler, which means\\r\\nboth \"to fly\" and \"to steal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Nickname for Napoleon III.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] _Jevôdre voir vô comment vô faites le painture?
