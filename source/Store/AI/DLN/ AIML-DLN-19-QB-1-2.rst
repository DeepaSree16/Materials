UNIT-4 Week-19 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Which of the following methods can be used for time-series forecasting?
1. Moving Average
2. Simple Exponential Smoothing
3. ARIMA

Options:

A.1 and 3

B.1 and 2

C.Only 3

D.1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
All three methods can be used for time series forecasting and this question is discussed in the time series modeling preview video.


**Question 2**

Which of the following statements is/are FALSE in the context of time series forecasting?

1. Moving average gives more weightage to the past observations and less weightage to the recent observations.
2. Simple average is the arithmetic mean of all the past observations.
3. Exponential smoothing gives more weightage to the recent observations and less weightage to the older observations.

Options:

A.2 and 3

B.Only 2

C.Only 1

D.1 and 3

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Statements 2 and 3 are true. Statement 1 is false. The correct answer is moving average k  is the mean value of the k most recent observations.

This question is discussed in the time series modeling preview video at the following time frames: 1:35- 1: 47


**Question 3**

How many gates are used in LSTM? 

A.3

B.2

C.1

D.4

**Answer: A** 

**Explanation:**
There are three different gates in an LSTM cell: a forget gate, an input gate, and an output gate



**Question 4**

Which of the following statements is/are true about GRU and LSTM?

1. GRU doesn’t need cell state to pass the input values
2. GRU need cell state to pass the input values
3. LSTM need cell state to pass the input value
4. LSTM doesn’t need cell state to pass the input value

Options:

A.1 and 3

B.2 and 3

C.2 and 4

D.1 and 4

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
This question was discussed in the LSTM and GRU preview video at the following time frames: 7:53 -8:19
