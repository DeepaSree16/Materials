UNIT-4 Week-20 Weekly Test Question & Answers 
===============================================

**Question 1**

If we had 4 neurons and 2 layers, the number of possible models  (Check the following link: Deep Neural Network)

Options

A.64

B.36

C.144

D.32

**Answer: B**

**Question 2**

Please go through the following `link <https://petewarden.com/2016/05/03/how-to-quantize-neural-networks-with-tensorflow/>`_ on quantization and answer the following question.

Why do we need quantization? 

1. To shrink file sizes by storing the min and max for each layer and then compressing each float value to an 8-bit integer representing the closet real number in a linear set of 256 within the range 

2. It reduces computational resources.

3. It will help you run your neural network models faster, and use less power by moving calculations over to eight-bit 

Options
A.1,  2 and 3
