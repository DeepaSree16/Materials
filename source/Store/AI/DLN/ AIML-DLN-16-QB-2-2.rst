UNIT-3 Week-16 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

Select the correct option, w.r.t. the Rocchio model:

1. The Query vector tries to move ‘towards’ the region where relevant results are present.
2. The Query vector tries to move ‘away’ from the regions where the irrelevant results are present.
3. The Query vectors move away from the centre of both relevant and irrelevant results.

Options:

A.Only 1 and 2 

B.Only 3

C.1, 2 and 3

D.Only 1

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The Rocchio algorithm uses a vector space model to pick relevance feedback query and tries to separate docs marked relevant and non-relevant. The New query moves toward relevant documents and away from irrelevant documents.



**Questions 2**

Why is HMM famous for Speech Recognition?

Options:

A.It helps for capturing sequential information present in the features

B.Hidden states suit for phonemes  modelling

C.Both a & b

D.None of the above

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The correct answer is C. HMM captures the sequential information present in the features which are need for modelling the phonemes.


**Question 3**

State True or False: Language model is not mandatory for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

Options:

A.True

B.False

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
language model is mandatory for ASR if we use HMM, but for the latest architectures of neural networks the Language model is not used.


**Question 4**

The possible approaches to building a machine learning model for Relevance Feedback systems are:

Options:

A.Individual vs Collaborative 

B.Reactive vs Proactive 

C.User Vs Item 

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**

The possible approaches to building a machine learning model for Relevance
Feedback systems are:

Individual vs Collaborative :

* Individual approach is used for personalized search (eg: google personalized search)
* The collaborative approaches for recommendation system is based on collaborator

Reactive vs Proactive: 

* The reactive approaches are those which explicitly asks for the user preferences either in a form of query or feedback
* Proactive approaches learn user preferences by the user behaviour


User Vs Item :

* Maintaining user information like age, gender, material status etc (explicit query). 
* Item information like movie genre
