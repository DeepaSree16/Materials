UNIT-3 Week-14 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

Select the FALSE statement w.r.t. Underfitting:

Options:

A.It can occur when a complex model (eg: defined by higher order polynomials) is used to model simple data distribution (eg: following low order polynomials)

B.It occurs when the model learns inadequately on the data during the training process

C.It occurs when the model does not fit with the training data.

D.Model  is less flexible and cannot account for the data

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The statements B , C and D are True for underfitting. Statement A is False because the statement is related to overfitting “It can occur when a complex model (eg: defined by higher order polynomials) is used to model simple data distribution (eg: following low order polynomials)”


**Question 2**

Select the TRUE statement(s):

1. In the K-Fold cross validation method the data is always split into two equal halves for training and validation
2. K-Fold cross validation has an advantage over the splitting data into fixed training and validation sets in identifying the overfitting
3. Out of k data points, You will use a k-1 set of data points for training and the remaining one set for testing. This is called Kfold cross validation

Options: 

A.1 and 2

B.1 and 3

C.Only 3

D.2 and 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
Statements 2 and 3 are True. Statement 1 is False. The correct statement is “KFold divides all the samples into k groups of samples”.


**Question 3**

Select the TRUE statement w.r.t. Overfitting:

1. It can occur as a result of memorization of training data
2. It can occur due to inappropriately tuned hyperparameters (eg. high max_depth value in decision tree model)
3. One of the manifestations of overfitting is that ML model does not generalise due to the impact of outliers (noise) in the data

Options:

A.Only 1 and 3 

B.Only 2 and 3

C.1, 2 and 3

D.Only 1 and 2

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Statement 1, 2 and 3 are True. When the model memorizes the training data and the noise, it adjusts the parameters in learning the training data very closely which cannot generalize well on new data.


**Question 4**

Select the FALSE statement below:

A.A high-bias model arises as a result of strong assumptions and is likely to underfit the training data

B.A high-variance model is seen when it has many degrees of freedom and is likely to overfit the training data

C.Increasing a model’s complexity will increase its bias and reduce its variance


**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** 
Statement C is FALSE. The correct statement is: Increasing a model’s complexity will increase its variance and reduce its bias.
