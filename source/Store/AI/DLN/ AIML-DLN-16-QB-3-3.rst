The input at time t=0 is [[1, 2, 3]]

The hidden to hidden matrix is [[1, 1] [2, 2]] 

The input to hidden matrix (Wxh) is [[1, 2] [2, 3] [1, 1]] 

The hidden to output matrix is [[1][5]] 

What is the shape of the output?

Options

A.(1, 1)

B.(1, 2)

C.(2, 1)

**Answer: A**


**Question 2**

Read the following `link <https://builtin.com/data-science/random-forest-algorithm>`_ and answer the following question:

Select the correct statement from the following:

Options

A.The main advantage of Random Forest is that it works fast even if there are a large number of trees and is therefore effective for real time predictions

B.The Random Forest algorithm randomly selects observations and features tobuild several decision trees and then averages the results

C.“Deep” decision trees do not suffer from overfitting

D.One limitation of Random Forest is that it can be used only for classification,not for regression

**Answer: B**
