UNIT-3 Week-16 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
======================================================

**Question 1**

The idea behind Ensemble methods is:

Options:

A.To combine weak classifiers to form a strong classifier

B.To combine strong classifiers to form a stronger classifier

C.To combine weak and strong classifiers to form a strong classifier

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Statement B and C are incorrect. The correct answer is. The idea of ensemble methods is to try reducing bias and variance of such weak learners by combining several of them together in order to create a strong learner (or ensemble model) that achieves better performances.



**Question 2**

Select the correct sequence of steps for a use case of Relevance Feedback:

1. System guesses the user intent and improves the answer
2. Search engine retrieves a set of possible answers
3. User ranks the answers according to order of relevance
4. A query is given
5. User gets useful and relevant information after multiple iterations

Options:

A.4, 2, 3, 1, 5

B.4, 1, 2, 5, 3

C.3, 4, 2, 1, 5

D.4, 3, 2, 1, 5

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The question is discussed in the Human in the loop preview video in the following time frames 3:14 - 6:25


**Question 3**

Which of the following is/are example(s) of a time series problem?

1. Predicting the number of hotel room bookings for each day in the next 6 months given previous data
2. Predicting the total sales for each day in the next 3 years, for an insurance company given previous data
3. Predicting the number of calls in a call centre for each day in the next week given previous data
4. Predicting the label of a given image based on the model trained 

Options:

A.Only 1 and 4 

B.1, 2, 3 and 4 

C.Only 1 and 2 

D.1, 2 and 3

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2 and 3 are correct. In time series we will predict the future data from the previous data. Whereas statement 4 belongs to the classification problem which cannot give the trend of future data.


**Question 4**

In which of the following Ensemble methods, more weightage is given to the training samples (in the next training epoch) which are misclassified.

Options:

A.Bagging

B.Random Forest

C.Boosting

D.Bootstrapping

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The question is discussed in the Ensemble Method preview video in the following time frames 4:20 - 5:51
