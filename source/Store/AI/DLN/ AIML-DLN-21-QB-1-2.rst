UNIT-4 Week-21 CFP Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Which of the following architectures are used for Image classification?

Options:

A.ResNet50

B.GoogleNet

C.VGG - 19

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
ResNet, GoogleNet and the VGG were trained on the ImageNet Dataset.


**Question 2**

Which of the following statements is/are TRUE about the learning rate with decay factor

Options:

A.High learning rate is constant over the time

B.Small learning rate is constant  over the time

C.learning rate changes over the time

**Answer : C**

**Explanation:**
If the learning rate is set too high, it can cause undesirable divergent behavior in your loss function. Whereas, a small learning rate requires many updates before reaching the minimum point. So, decay in learning rate starts training the network with a large learning rate and then slowly reduces it until local minima is obtained.


**Question 3**

Which of the following is/are TRUE about Reinforcement learning?

Options:

A.Agent performs an action(s) based on the feedback

B.Environment sends feedback to the Agent.

C.Agent gets rewards according to the last action taken.
