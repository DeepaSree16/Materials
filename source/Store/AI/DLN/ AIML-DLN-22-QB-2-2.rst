UNIT-4 Week-22 CFU Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

**Question 1**

Which of the following use cases can be solved using NLP techniques?

Options:

A.Question Answering

B.Automatic text summarization

C.Chatbot interactions

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** All of the above problems can be solved using NLP techniques.



**Question 2**

In NLP, which of the following word embeddings support context and bidirectional modeling:

Options

A.Word2Vec

B.BERT

C.GloVe

D.All the above

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.


**Question 3**

Which of the following statements are True about Triplet loss?.

1.Triplet loss involves an anchor example and one positive or matching example (same class) and one negative or non-matching example (differing class).

2.The Triplet loss function penalizes the model such that the distance between the matching samples’ representation is reduced and the distance between the non-matching samples’ representation is increased.

3.The Triplet loss learns semantically meaningful features. 

4.The Triplet loss function penalizes the model such that the distance between the matching samples’ representation is increased and the distance between the non-matching samples’ representation is reduced 

Options: 

A.Both 1 and 2

B.Both 2 and 3

C.1, 2 and 3

D.1, 3 and 4

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** Triplet loss operates on 3 inputs, anchor which is an arbitrary data point, positive (p) which is the same class as the anchor and negative (n) which is a different class from the anchor. The Triplet loss function penalizes the model such that the distance between the matching examples is reduced and the distance between the non-matching examples is increased. 



**Question 4** 

Which of the following is/are applications of Siamese networks?

Options:

A.Facial Recognition

B.Matching resumes to jobs

C.Signature verification

D.All of the above

**Answer: D**
 
**Explanation:**
Some of the Siamese Network applications are Text similarity for a job profile to resume matching, Compare Fingerprinting, Signature Verification, Facial Recognition, Evaluate disease severity based on clinical grading, Text similarity for pairing similar questions
