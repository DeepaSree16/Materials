## Question 3

------------------- is used when the standard deviation of the population is unknown and has to be approximated from the sample

### Options

B. risk averter
C. high expected utility

**Answer:** A

## Question 7

The analysis of a complex decision situation by constructing a mathematical model of the situation and then performing a large number of iterations in order to determine the probability distribution of outcomes is called

### Options

A. a decision tree
B. simulation
C. diversification

**Answer:** B

## Question 8

### Options

A. 6%
B. 2.5%
C. 4%

**Answer:** A

## Question 9

The hypothesis test is conducted to test whether a certain population mean is equal to or greater than 24.4. It is known that the population standard deviation is 7.6. A sample of size 60 is selected from the population and the sample mean is calculated as 23.52. Assume that the population follow a normal distribution. What is the p-value of this test?

### Options

A. 0.127
B. 0.452
C. 0.816

**Answer:** C

## Question 10

A one sample, one-tailed t-test is conducted and the test statistic value is calculated to be 2.56. The degree of freedom for the test are 45. Which of the following conclusions for the test would be correct?

### Options

A. The null hypothesis can be rejected at the 1% level of significance
B. The null hypothesis can be rejected at the 5% level of significance
C. Both A and B

**Answer:** C

## Question 11

Which of the following is the first step in hypothesis testing?

### Options

A. Drawing a sample from the population
B. Developing a null and alternative hypothesis
C. None of the above

**Answer:** B

## Question 12

Which of the following shows a right-tailed test?

### Options

A. H1: µ < 15
B. H1: µ > 15
C. H0: µ < 15

**Answer:** B

## Question 13

In a data science a ----------- is a set of assumptions about data.

### Options

A. Prediction
B. Simulation
C. Model

**Answer:** C

## Question 14

It is known that for right-handed people, the dominant (right) hand tends to be stronger. For left-handed people in the world designed for right-handed people, the same may not be true. To test this, muscle strength was measured on the right and left hands of a random sample of 15 left-handed men and the difference (left - right) was found. The alternative hypothesis is one-sided (left hand stronger). The resulting t-statistic was 1.80. This is an example of 

### Options

A. t-test
B. a two-sample t-test
C. a paired t-test

**Answer:** C
