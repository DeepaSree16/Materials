# Question 5

In this kind of Machine Learning, an AI system is presented with data which is labeled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label.

### Options

a. Supervisied Learning
b. Unspervisied Learning
c. Reinforcement Learning

**Answer:** a

# Question 6

This type of Machine Learning learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. It is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment.

a. Supervisied Learning
b. Unspervisied Learning
c. Reinforcement Learning

**Answer:** c
