\textbf{Problem 1:}
\vspace{10pt} \\
	The Acme Battery Company has developed a new cell phone battery. On average, the battery lasts 60 minutes on a single charge. The standard deviation is 4 minutes. \\

Suppose the manufacturing department runs a quality control test. They randomly select 7 batteries. The standard deviation of the selected batteries is 6 minutes. What would be the chi-square statistic represented by this test? \\

\textbf{Problem 2:}
\vspace{10pt} \\
Let's revisit the problem presented above. The manufacturing department ran a quality control test, using 7 randomly selected batteries. In their test, the standard deviation was 6 minutes, which equated to a chi-square statistic of 13.5. \\

Suppose they repeated the test with a new random sample of 7 batteries. What is the probability that the standard deviation in the new test would be greater than 6 minutes?
