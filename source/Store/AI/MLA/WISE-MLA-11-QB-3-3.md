### Options
A. Number of attributes used to build the model
B. Cost function J
C. None of the above

**Answer:** C

## Question 2
If Correlation value is 0.15. What does that Indicate:
### Options
A. High positive association
B. Perfect Linear Association
C. negligible/weak positive association

**Answer:** C

## Question 3

The difference between Batch Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent

### Options

A. SGD updates the weights after evaluating samples one by one, GD does it after every batch 
B. SGD updates the weights after every batch but stochastically (meaning randomly), GD does it after every batch 
C. SGD is really a stochastic process,  it randomly updates the weights, GD does it  for every batch

**Answer:** A

## Question 4
How to measure the goodness of fit of a regression line

C. Beta coefficients

**Answer:** A

## Question 5
Which metric is used in measuring individual impact of variables in a mode?

### Options
A. R-Square
B. Correlation
C. P-value

**Answer:** C

## Question 6

The learning can be much faster with ---------- gradient descent on very large dataset

### Options

A. Stochastic
B. Mini-Batch
C. Batch

**Answer:** A 

## Question 7

Which of the following statement(s) is incorrect?

### Options

A. Correlation of -0.8 is indicates high association than correlation value of 0.2
B. Correlation can not be negative
C. Correlation maximum value is 1

**Answer:** B

## Question 8

If the label has only two classes, the learning algorithm is a ------------ classifier

### Options

A. Binary
B. Multi-class
C. Both A and B 

**Answer:** A

## Question 9

Batch Gradient Descent can be slow to run on very large datasets. Why?

### Options

A. Because one iteration doesnâ€™t reach the local minimum and hence multiple iterations have to be made.
B. Because each iteration may not actually descend towards the answer.
C. Because each iteration requires a prediction for each instance in the training dataset.

**Answer:** C

## Question 10

The value of the loss function is minimum at a particular point in a local region is: 

### Options

A. global minimum
B. local minimum
C. None of the above

**Answer:** B

## Question 13

Choose the correct order for gradient descent method:

1. Initialize the weights W randomly
2. Calculate the gradients G of cost function w.r.t parameters by using partial differentiation
3. Update the weights by an amount proportional to G
4. Repeat until the cost J(W) stops reducting or some pre-defined termination criteria is met 

### Options

A. 1,2,3,4
B. 2,3,14
