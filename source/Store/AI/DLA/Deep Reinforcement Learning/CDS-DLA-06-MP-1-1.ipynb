That is, it unites function approximation and target optimization, mapping states and actions to the rewards they lead to.\n","\n","Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to achieve a complex objective (goal) or how to maximize along a particular dimension over many steps; for example, they can maximize the points won in a game over many moves. Reinforcement learning algorithms can start from a blank slate, and under the right conditions, achieve superhuman performance. Like a pet incentivized by scolding and treats, these algorithms are penalized when they make the wrong decisions and rewarded when they make the right ones – this is reinforcement.\n","\n","![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/974/0*NgZ_bq_nUOq73jK_.png)\n","\n","**SAC:** Soft Actor Critic is defined for RL tasks involving continuous actions. The biggest feature of SAC is that it uses a modified RL objective function. Instead of only seeking to maximize the lifetime rewards, SAC seeks to also maximize the entropy of the policy.
