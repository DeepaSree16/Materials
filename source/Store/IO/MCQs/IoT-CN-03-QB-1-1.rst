1. **The frequency band of Bluetooth radio is around \______\_**

    1. 2.1 GHz

    2. 2.3 GHz

    3. 2.4 GHz

    4. None of the above

..

   **Answer: 3**

   The frequency band of Bluetooth radio is around 2.4 GHz.

2. **A \________\_ node is a node from which data is being sent.**

    1. Master node

    2. Slave node

    3. Master and slave node

    4. None of the above

..

   **Answer:** 1

   A master node is a node from which data is being sent

3. **The Bluetooth version 5 supports IoT devices**

    1. True

    2. False

..

   **Answer:** 1

   The Bluetooth version 5 supports IoT devices, whereas version 4.2
   doesn't support

   IoT devices.

4. **Bluetooth supports \_______.**

    1. point-to-point connections

    2. point-to-multipoint connection

    3. both point-to-point connections and point-to-multipoint connection

    4. multipoint to point connection

..

   **Answer:** 3

   In Bluetooth, each slave node communicates with the master of the
   piconet independently i.e., each master-slave connection is
   independent. The slave is not allowed to communicate with other
   slaves directly.

5. **Bluetooth is the wireless technology for \__________.**

    1. local area network

    2. personal area network

    3. metropolitan area network

    4. wide area network

..

   **Answer:** 2

   Bluetooth is a wireless technology used to create a wireless personal
   area network for data transfer up to 10 meters. It operates on 2.45
   GHz frequency band for transmission.

    1. Expected RSSI at 1m distance

    2. Power consumed by the server when the client is at a 1m distance from
    the server

    3. Expected power loss at 1m distance

    4. Sum of power measured at the server and the client when the client is
    at a 1m distance from the server

..

   **Answer: 1**

   By standard definition.

5. **Statement 1: BLE can be used for short-distance communication.**

   ** Statement 2: BLE consumes more power (on average) than classical Bluetooth.**
