1. **The received power increases with**

    1. Decrease in distance

    2. Increase in frequency

    3. Decrease in antenna gain

    4. All of the above

..

   **Answer:** 1

   Received power is inversely proportional to the distance square as
   well as frequency. On the other hand, it is directly proportional to
   the antenna gain.

2. **Shannon capacity at SNR=10 dB is**

    1. B*log2(10) bps

    2. B bps

    3. B*log2(11) bps

    4. 0 bps

..

   **Answer:** C

   Capacity is given by B log2 (1+SNR); SNR is normal; 10 dB = 10 (in
   normal)

3. **Overhearing is a major issue in**

    1. Fixed assignment protocols

    2. Random assignment protocols

    3. Demand assignment protocols

    4. None of the above

..

   **Answer: B**

   The receiver has to be awake in Random assignment protocols as it
   does not know when the transmitter is going to transmit.

4. **Which of the following methods reduce idle listening?**

    1. TDMA

    2. Slotted Aloha

    3. CSMA

    4. Aloha

..

   **Answer: 1**

   Since transmitter and receiver both know the allotted slot timings,
   they can sleep at other times.

5. **Ways to reduce energy consumption or wastage**

    1. Low duty cycle

    2. Low data rates

    3. Low range

    4. All of the above

..

   **Answer: D**

   Low data rates mean low processing, low duty cycle means more sleep,
   low range means low transmission power.

1. **Do the channels in the WiFi 2.4 GHz band overlap?**

    1. Yes

    2. No

..

   **Answer:** Yes

   They are shifted by 15 MHz but have 20 MHz bandwidth.

2. **Does the restricted Access Window feature in IEEE 802.11ah support
   scalability?**

    1. Yes

    2. No

..

   **Answer:** Yes

   It allows multiple thousands users with reduced collisions.

3. **Does the target Wakeup time help in increasing scalability?**

    1. Yes

    2. No

..

   **Answer:** No

   Helps in energy efficiency.

4. **Which of the following interfaces can be used for WLAN module
   integration?**

    1. PCIe

    2. SDIO

    3. UART

    4. None

    5. Both b and c

..

   **Answer: 5**

   Both SDIO and UART are used for interfacing WLAN modules in embedded
   systems. PCIe is used for very high data rates and usually in
   computers.

   **.**

5. **WPA uses a**

    1. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol

    2. Advanced Encryption Standard

    3. Push-button

    4. None

..

   **Answer:** A

   WPA uses TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) and changes its key
   dynamically

1. **What is an access point (AP)?**

    1. Wireless devices

    2. A device that provides wireless connections and allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network

    3. Both

    4. None

..

   **Answer:** 2

   The access point in a wireless network is any device that will allow
   the wireless devices to a wired network. AP provides wireless
   connections using wireless LAN technology, typically Wi-Fi, for other
   devices to use that wired connection. APs support the connection of
   multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection.

2. **What is RSSI at the client?**

    1. Estimated measure of the power level received by client RF

    2. Estimated measure of the power level transmitted by client RF

    3. Estimated measure of the power level generated by AP RF

    4. None

..

   **Answer:** 1

   RSSI stands for received signal strength indicator and gives an
   estimated measure of the power level that an RF client device is
   receiving from an access point or router

3. **What does a NAT router do?**

    1. One or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa

    2. Repeats signals

    3. Implements Internet Control Message Protocol

    4. None

..

   **Answer:** 1

   Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more
   local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and
   vice versa in to provide Internet access to the local hosts.
   Generally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e the router
   which has one interface in the local (inside) network and one
   interface in the global (outside) network.

4. **A Network repeater**

    1. increases the power of a signal and retransmits it.

    2. interfaces in multiple networks whose task is to copy packages from one network to another.

    3. reads the outermost section of the data packet to tell where the message is going.

    4. None

..

   **Answer:** 1

   A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and
   retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that
   the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other
   side of an obstruction.

5. **ESP32 has \__________\_ combination**

    1. WiFi + BT + BLE

    2. WiFi + BLE

    3. WiFi + BT

    4. None
..

    **Answer**: A
