Objects have two kinds of attributes (accessed via . syntax): data attributes (or instance variables) and function attributes (or methods). Object data is typically modified by object methods.\n","\n","**Why object oriented programming?**\n","\n","- Concept of object oriented programming has been around since 1960s\n","\n","- Gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the development and standardization of C++, and faster computers that mitigated the overhead of the abstractions\n","\n","- Abstraction, modularity, and reusability are some of the most commonly cited reasons for using object oriented programming\n","\n","- Almost all new software development uses some degree of object oriented programming (for better or worse)\n","\n","- In Python, everything is an object. Proper use of object oriented programming features allows programmers to write code that integrates nicely into the Python language and set of libraries.\n","\n","**Terminology**\n","\n","The basic concepts related to OOP are as follows:\n","\n","- **Object:** clearly defines an entity in terms of its properties and behaviour.\n","- **Class:** a blueprint of an object.\n","- **Encapsulation:** combining of data and the functions associated with that data in a single unit\n","- **Data Hiding:** the mechanism of hiding the data of a class from the outside world\n","- **Abstraction:** providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details\n","- **Inheritance:** forming a new class (derived class) from an existing class (called the base class).\n","- **Polymorphism:** ability to use an operator or function in various forms.\n","- **Static Binding:** the linking of function call to the function definition is done during compilation of the program.\n","- **Dynamic Binding:** the linking of function call to the function definition is done during the execution of the program.\n","\n","To know more about OOP click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)\n","\n","To know more about Access Modifiers in Python click [here](https://medium.com/@YSR/access-modifiers-in-python-public-private-protected-fe5f923bd914)\n","\n","**Object oriented programming in Python**\n","\n","- In Python, everything is an object.
