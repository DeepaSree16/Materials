2. If it is possible to make only one meaningful word with the first, the third and the fourth
and the sixth \includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}letters of the word LEARNING, using each only once, which of the following
will be the third letter of that word? If more than one such word can be formed, give ‘Y’ as
the answer and if no such word can be formed, give ‘Z’ as the answer.\\

the ninth letters \includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}of the word MEDIATION, which of following will be the third letter of that
word? If no such word can be made, give ‘X’ as the answer and if more than one such word
can be made, give ‘Z’ as the answer.\\
1) A \hspace{2mm}2) N \hspace{2mm}3) M \hspace{2mm}4) X \hspace{2mm}5) Z\\

4. If it is possible to make only one meaningful word with the first, second, sixth and tenth
letters of the \includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}word DISCLAIMER, which of the following will be the second letter of the
word formed? If no such word can be made, give ‘X’ as your answer and if more than one
such word can be made, give ‘Y’ as the answer.\\
1) I \hspace{2mm}2) R \hspace{2mm}3) D \hspace{2mm}4) X \hspace{2mm}5) Y\\

\textbf{Model 2: Position of a Particular Letter after Rearrangement}\\

5. If the positions of the first and the sixth letters in the word CONTAGIOUS are interchanged,
similarly the \includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}positions of the second and the seventh letters are interchanged, and so on,
which letter will be the second to the right of the fifth letter from the right?\\
1) O \hspace{2mm}2) N \hspace{2mm}3) I \hspace{2mm}4) T \hspace{2mm}5) None of these\\

6. If the positions of the first and the sixth letters in the word CULTIVATOR are reversed, the
positions of \includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}the second and the seventh letters are reversed, and so on, which of the
following will be the second from the right end after the rearrangement?\\
1) T \hspace{2mm}2) O \hspace{2mm}3) L \hspace{2mm}4) V \hspace{2mm}5) None of these\\

7. The positions of the first and the fifth digits in the number 53261489 are interchanged.\\
\includegraphics[width=0.60555in,height=0.32083in]{image2.png}Similarly, the positions of the second and the sixth digits are interchanged, and so on. Which
of the following will be the second from the right end after the rearrangement?
