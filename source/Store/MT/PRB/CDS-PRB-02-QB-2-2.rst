Module-2 Quiz-2 Question & Answers with Explanation
=======================================================

1. Select the TRUE statement(s), w.r.t the shape of any distribution that is described by its various ‘moments’:
   
        1.) The first moment is the mean, which indicates the central tendency of a distribution.
        
        2.) The second moment of the centered data is the variance, which indicates the width or deviation of data points from the mean

        3.) The third moment of the centered data is the skewness, which indicates any asymmetric ‘leaning’ to either left or right.

        4.) The fourth moment of the centered data is the Kurtosis, which indicates the degree of ‘fatness’ of the outer tails.

Options:

1. Only 1 and 2
2. 1, 2, 3 and 4 
3. Only 2, 3 and 4
4. Only 1

**Answer: 2**

2. Match the terms with their definitions correctly:

| 1.It is a scaling technique in which data points are rescaled so that  |                       |
| they fall within a range of 0 to 1. It is also known as min-max        |                       |

`A` (1) - (c), (2) - (a), (3) - (b), (4) - (d)

`B` (1) - (a), (2) - (c), (3) - (d), (4) - (b)

`C` (1) - (c), (2) - (a), (3) - (d), (4) - (b)

`D` (1) - (a), (2) - (c), (3) - (b), (4) - (d)

Answer: A

3.  A coin is flipped 10 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 4 tails?
Hint: Solve using Binomial Probability: P(S) = nc\ :sub:`s`  p\ :sup:`s`  q\ :sup:`(n-s)`
Where n = total number of trials; s = total number of successful trials; p = probability of success in one trial; q = probability of failure in one trial



Options:

1. 0.156 (approx)

2. 0.332 (approx)

3. 0.025 (approx)

4. 0.204 (approx)

**Answer: 4**

**Solution:** 

P(S) = nc\ :sub:`s`  p\ :sup:`s`  q\ :sup:`(n-s)`

Here, n= 10; s = 4; p = 1/2; q = 1/2
 
 **Note:** nc\ :sub:`s` = n! / [s! (n-s)!]

So, P(S) = [10! ⁄ (4! × 6!)] × (½)\ :sup:`4` × (½)\ :sup:`(10-4)`   
               
        =  [3,628,800 / 24 x 720] x 0.0625 x 0.0156
               
        =  210 x 0.0625 x 0.0156
               
        =  0.204


4. What is the Q3 quartile value for the following data consisting of ages of employees of a sports store: 20, 27, 25, 31, 29, 28, 33

A. 33
B. 31
C. 29
D. 28

**Answer 2**

**Solution:**

Quartile 3 = 3(n+1) / 4
                 
                 = 3(7+1) / 4
                 
                 = 24 / 4
                 
                 = 6
i.e. the 6th item in a sorted list of ages: 20, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33

i.e. 31

5. Select the FALSE statement:

A. The central limit theorem states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean for a variable will approximate a normal distribution regardless of that variable's distribution in the population
B. The law of large numbers states that as the sample size grows, its mean will get closer and closer to the average of the whole population.
C. A skewed probability distribution has high entropy and a balanced probability distribution has low entropy
D. Mutual information is calculated between two variables and measures the reduction in uncertainty for one variable given a known value of the other variable 

**Answer: 3**

**Solution:**

Statements 1, 2 and 4 are True. Statement 3 is False. The correct statement is that ‘A skewed probability distribution has low entropy and a balanced probability distribution has high entropy’.
