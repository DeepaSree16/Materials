This is a Python library developed by Google, and it contains a lot of functionality within it or built around it for the purpose of building machine learning models. Although TensorFlow is most commonly used with Python, it can be used in C/C++ and other languages too, which is important because it allows us to train a model in Python and then integrate it into an existing application written in another language.\n","\n","* A main selling point of TensorFlow is that it can automatically differentiate computations. This is an essential feature for deep learning that uses gradient-based optimization (backpropagation), and it figures out the gradients by itself. There are things like Autograd or JAX for NumPy, but they are not as powerful as TensorFlow automatic differentiation, which actually maintains a computation graph structure under the hood (the name \"TensorFlow\" refers to the tensors and their gradients \"flowing\" through the computation graph).\n","\n","* Numpy usually works better with the \"traditional\" Python stack, like Matplotlib, Pandas, dask, pyplot, etc. There are some handful libraries like scikit-learn or chainer, which work with NumPy to perform Machine learning operations.
