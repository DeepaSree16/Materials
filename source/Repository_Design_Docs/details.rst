**To whom does this standard apply?**

All requirements of ISO 21001 are generic and intended to be applicable to educational 
organizations that provide, share and facilitate the construction of knowledge through 
teaching, training or research, regardless of type, size and the product and service provided. The standard therefore applies to the management system of any organization 
utilizing a curriculum to provide, share and transfer knowledge

**Why is ISO 21001 important**

There is a critical and continuous need for educational organizations to evaluate the 
degree to which they meet the requirements of learners and other customers, in order 
to improve their ability to continue to do so. 
ISO 21001 focuses on the specific interaction between an educational organization, the 
learner and other customers. Current educational processes are becoming increasingly 
focused on co-creation where the traditional customer-supplier relationship is refined 
into a collaborative partnership. This standard will give guidance on how to deliver 
quality in this challenging new environment. 
Education differs from many other sectors in that a successful educational process maximizes the chance that a learner will succeed, though it cannot guarantee that outcome. 
The effort and capability of both the learner and educational organization are crucial 
variables for the educational process to be successful. Learning involves the internalization of knowledge, methods and skills. The educational organization stimulates this 
internalization and provides the framework, input, processes and learning resources 
for it to take place. However, it is the effort and capability of the learner that ultimately 
determines the success of the educational process

**Who can benefit from ISO 21001**

Although learners and educational organizations worldwide are the main beneficiaries 
of this new management system standard, all stakeholders (i.e. everyone) will benefit 
from the output of standardized management systems in educational organizations. 
Educational organizations that will benefit from the standard include pre-school, 
primary, elementary, middle schools and high schools, colleges, universities, adult 
education, special education schools, vocational education and training, tutoring or 
coaching centres, training organizations, education/training departments, consultants, 
and non-formal educational service providers. This is true regardless of the funding 
source, which can be public (subsidized), private (commercial), self-sufficient (internally 
generated revenue) or not for profit (sponsored). 
Finally, all interested parties involved in determining requirements will benefit from 
this International Standard (teachers, parents, government, NGOs, trade unions, etc.).
