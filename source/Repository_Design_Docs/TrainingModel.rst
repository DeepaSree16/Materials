Purpose
-------
    This document explains the following:
    
    1. The underlying model and philosophy of training -- 
        
        * LEARN
        * PRACTISE
        * ASSESS

Scope
-----
  The Learn-Practise-Assess framework is relatively new. It was 
  formalised in mid 2014. So a number of modules may not be fully
  deploying this approach. In that sense, this is a blueprint for
  action and deployment.

  It is also noted that some topics, sessions and modules are more
  suited for this approach, while a small number are not very amenable.

  This list is being compiled and will be made available in the wiki
  pages of the repository.

What is the L-P-A cycle?

TBD
