Content Artefacts
-----------------
:Program Design: These are standard instruction design documents detailing
    the audience, objectives, selection process, coverage, and assessment
    strategies. The list of courses that comprise the program and the sequence
    is also documented here. Certification processes and norms are specified here.

    If a course is part of more than one program, the specific changes for
    each program are also documented here.

:Course Design: These are standard instruction design documents detailing
    the audience, objectives, coverage, and assessment strategies. The list
    of modules that comprise the course and the sequence is also documented here.

:Module Design: The standard objectives and assessment strategies are documented.
    Also the syllabus and coverage along with the sessionwise breakup are set out
    in these documents. 

:Session Design: The session's objectives, classroom activities and the sequence
                 of topics and amount of time to be allocated -- in units of five minutes.

:Mindmaps:	These capture a high-level view of a course or module or session (rarely
           a topic). Meant primarily for trainers to understand the scope and coverage.
           Trainers are encouraged to use these as the first item in the introduction to
           the course or module or session.

:Presentations: Slide decks, in standard TalentSprint template. Should be in pdf format;
                but as a transitional measure ppt format is acceptable.
                  Trainers will use these in directed learning sessions.

:Activities: Students will participate in various activities during the session. Activity
             Instruction Sheets and Observation Sheets will be distributed. This is for BizComm --
             but not restricted to it.
             
:Activity Instructions: Students will be provided these sheets which explains the rules, details and process of the activity.

:Observation Sheets: Using these sheets the peer performance in activities is evaluated under various parameters. This sheet is only provided based on the activity requirement.

:Assignments: Students will work on these during assisted practice sessions.

:Question bank:	Trainers will assemble different questions of different formats into formative & summative assessments.

:Videos: Students will use these for self learning and review.

:Trainer Notes: Trainers will use these for reference and to capture their experience for future reference.

:Student Guide: Students will use these for self learning and reference.

:Project Abstracts: Trainers will share these with students at the begining of project work

:Mini-project: Students will work on these small projects in a mentor assisted session

:Solution of Mini-project: Students will study and discuss this solution to the mini-project

:Hackathon: Students will work on these larger end-to-end projects in a mentor assisted session
 
:Additional Notebook: Students will work on these during self study

:Case Study: Students will study these case specific examples during self study

:Class Recording: Students will study by re-visiting lectures from these video class recordings

:Dataset: Students will use datasets in assignments and projects
