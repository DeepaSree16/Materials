| **Understanding the organization and its context**

| The organization shall determine external and internal issues that are relevant to its purpose, its social responsibility and its strategic direction, and that affect its ability to achieve the intended outcomes of its EOMS.

| The organization shall monitor and review information about these external and internal issues.

| **NOTE 1** Issues can include positive and negative factors or conditions for consideration.

| **NOTE 2** Understanding the external context can be facilitated by considering issues arising from technological, competitive, market, cultural, social, political, economic and environmental factors, whether international, national, regional or local.

| **NOTE 3** Understanding the internal context can be facilitated by considering issues related to values, culture, knowledge and performance of the organization.

| **NOTE 4** Strategic direction can be expressed through documented information such as the organizational mission or vision statement.

| **Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties**

| Due to their effect or potential effect on the organization’s ability to consistently and sustainably provide educational products and services, the organization shall determine:

| a) the interested parties that are relevant to the EOMS;

| b) the relevant requirements of these interested parties.

| These interested parties shall include:

| — learners

| — other beneficiaries

| — staff of the organization

| The organization shall monitor and review information about these interested parties and their relevant requirements.

| **Determining the scope of the management system for educational organizations**

| The organization shall determine the boundaries and applicability of the EOMS to establish its scope. When determining this scope, the organization shall consider:

| a) the external and internal issues

| b) the requirements of relevant interested parties

| c) the products and services of the organization

| The organization shall apply all the requirements of this document if they are applicable within the determined scope of its EOMS.

| The scope of the EOMS shall be available and be maintained as documented information. The scope shall state the types of products and services covered, and provide justification for any requirement of this document that the organization determines is not applicable to its EOMS.

| Conformity to this document may only be claimed if the requirements determined as not being applicable do not affect the organization’s ability or responsibility to ensure the conformity of its products and services and the enhancement of learners' and other beneficiaries' satisfaction.

| All products and services provided to learners by an educational organization shall be included within the scope of this EOMS

| **Management system for educational organizations (EOMS)**

| The organization shall establish, implement, maintain and continually improve an EOMS, including the processes needed and their interactions, in accordance with the requirements of this document.

| The organization shall determine processes for the EOMS and their application throughout the organization and shall:

| a) determine the inputs required and the outputs expected from these processes;

| b) determine the sequence and interaction of these processes;

| c) determine and apply the criteria and methods (including monitoring, measurement and related performance indicators) needed to ensure the effective operation and control of these processes;

| d) determine the resources needed for these processes and ensure their availability;

| e) assign the responsibilities and authorities for these processes;

| f) address the risks and opportunities as determined in accordance with the requirements;

| g) evaluate these processes and implement any changes needed to ensure that these processes achieve their intended results;

| h) improve the processes and the EOMS.

| **To the extent necessary, the organization shall:**
