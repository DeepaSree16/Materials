Advantages are advertisers can reach users who are interested in their products, allows for detailed analysis and reporting, information gathered is real, not from statistical projections, does not access IP-addresses of the users."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U1nHORW_P2kH"},"source":["### Description\n","\n","The dataset chosen for this  experiment is Social Network Ads.
