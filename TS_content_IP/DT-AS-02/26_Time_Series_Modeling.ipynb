Heteroscedasticity means unequal scatter. Specifically, heteroscedasticity is a systematic change in the spread of the residuals over the range of measured values.

An extension to ARIMA that supports the direct modeling of the seasonal component of the series is called SARIMA.\n","\n","A problem with ARIMA is that it does not support seasonal data. That is a time series with a repeating cycle.\n","\n","ARIMA expects data that is either not seasonal or has the seasonal component removed, e.g. seasonally adjusted via methods such as seasonal differencing.
