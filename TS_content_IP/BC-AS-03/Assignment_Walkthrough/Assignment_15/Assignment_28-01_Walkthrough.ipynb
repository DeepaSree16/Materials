Define three methods **calculate_average()**,  **get_grade()** and **display_std_details()**. The **calculate_average()** is to calculate the average score. **get_grade()** will decide the grade as per the average score. The grade calculation table is given below.\n","\n","        Average Score       Grade\n","\n","            > = 80           S\n","         < 80 and >=70       A\n","         < 70 and >=60       B\n","         < 60 and >=40       C\n","           < 40              F \n","\n","Finally **display_std_details()** will return the **name, age, score1, score2,score3, average score** and **Grade** of student.\n","\n","Solve the given problem statement using **Object-Oriented Programming** and display the details of **three** different students.\n","\n","**Expected Output:**\n","\n","\n","    Raj      16   80 75 88 81.00 S\n","    John     21   62 77 51 63.33 A\n","    Sofia    18   20 20 28 22.67 F"],"metadata":{"id":"rPdsZYKoeCJN"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"x_rVgo4pd-Ok","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653352769724,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Indira Priyadarshini Talasila","userId":"03785172896691744538"}},"outputId":"ffbce34e-3521-4e3e-f51d-9162adc61448"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Raj      16    80 75 88  81.00 S\n","John     21    62 77 51  63.33 B\n","Sofia    18    20 20 28  22.67 F\n"]}],"source":["class Students:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age, score1, score2, score3):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","        self.score1 = score1\n","        self.score2 = score2\n","        self.score3 = score3\n","\n","    def calculate_average(self):\n","        return (self.score1 + self.score2 + self.score3) / 3 \n","\n","    def get_grade(self):\n","        avg_score = self.calculate_average()\n","        if avg_score >= 80:\n","            grade = \"S\"\n","        elif 70 <= avg_score < 80:\n","            grade = \"A\"\n","        elif 60 <= avg_score < 70:\n","            grade = \"B\"\n","        elif 40 <= avg_score < 60:\n","            grade = \"C\"\n","        else:\n","            grade = \"F\"\n","        return grade\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return f'{self.name:5} {self.age:5} {self.score1:5} {self.score2} {self.score3} {self.calculate_average(): .2f} {self.get_grade()}'\n","\n","\n","std1 = Students('Raj', 16, 80, 75, 88)\n","print(std1)\n","std2 = Students('John', 21, 62, 77, 51)\n","print(std2)\n","std3 = Students('Sofia', 18, 20, 20, 28)\n","print(std3)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"P91HQaXGgSQT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
