See the example for more clarity.\n","\n","There are five students in a class. Their marks distribution is:\n","98 68 74 21 74\n","\n","That is first student gets marks 98, second gets 68, and so on.\n","Now , the highest marks is 98. So, the first student gets rank 1.\n","Next higher marks is 74. So student 3 and 5 gets rank 2.\n","Next higher marks is 68 and there are three students (1,3,5) who have got marks higher than him. So he gets rank 4.\n","Similarly , student with marks 21 gets rank 5.\n","\n","\n","Sample data in the file\n","\n","    John, 84\n","    Micheal, 90\n","    Peter, 65\n","    Jenny, 90\n","    Ryan,
